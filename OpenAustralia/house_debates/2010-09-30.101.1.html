        I rise today to advise the House of happy developments in the area of community infrastructure in the town of Kulnura in the part of my electorate that we call ‘the plateau’ around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Mountain
        </a>
        . On Sunday, 19 September, I joined the residents of Kulnura at the official opening of the Kulnura Pioneer Memorial Hall. Kulnura may be a small mountain town of about 400 people, but there is a mountain of community spirit in Kulnura. There were at least 100 people there for the day of the opening, and they put on a great spread in true country style. While I shared a cup of tea and delicious homemade scones, with the obligatory jam and cream of course, I heard wonderful stories about Christmas concerts that had been held, ballet classes and dances where young lovers had met and later continued to live their lives up there on the mountain. Some of the pictures that the locals pulled out were testament to how important this community hall has been in helping the community to gather and to share journeys along the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we cut the ribbon it was held by four wonderful women from the mountain who were in attendance at the first 1930s opening of the very hall that I was there to reopen in its new condition. Colleen Fraser told me about the interesting if chequered history of the memorial hall. It was first built as a memorial hall in Spencer for soldiers in the 1920s. It burnt down and was rebuilt in Kulnura sometime in the 1930s. The parents of several members of the 3-5-5 Committee were involved in extensions over the years. The hall hosted balls and formals and all manner of community events, but over time fell into disrepair.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was until the federal Labor government came along with the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program as part of the successful Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. We kicked in $81,000 for the refurbishment and Wyong Council chipped in another $20,000. That paid for a whole new kitchen, which was in full flight on the day; a full internal insulated ceiling; painting inside and out; a new vinyl floor for the meeting room; new steps to the stage; fire safe doors; and disabled access.
       </p>
       <p>
        Colleen, the 355 Committee President,

        and their fellow committee members and residents were absolutely over the moon, as you can imagine. This was a hall where a tin roof was also the ceiling. In summer and winter it was very warm or very cold indeed. One of the residents told me of a party that they had held recently before the refurbishment. They showed up with guests in tow and found they could not turn on the taps because they were in such a state of disrepair. You can imagine the challenges they had to face that afternoon.

        Now they have a very different facility—a user-friendly facility for the Kulnura Community Arts and Entertainment Program to conduct its activities. Some of the activities on offer now in Kulnura are belly dancing, a drumming circle, school pantomimes and a holiday program. All of this will be happening at the Kulnura Pioneer Memorial Hall, which will also host a sculpture group. I hear that some ladies are considering starting a craft group there too.
       </p>

        Kulnura is not a big place, but it is a great example of what a wonderfully effective program the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program is. It was administered by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and

        in the last government. Under the Regional and Local Community infrastructure program, more than $1 billion was allocated to projects in every single local government area. I cannot put a price on community spirit, but one thing that is priceless is the fact that, due to a range of Labor’s stimulus programs such as the

        , our economy has weathered the global financial crisis better than any other advanced economy. Our national unemployment of five per cent is the envy of the world. Those on the other side may try to find fault but they should be cheering the Treasurer for what he has achieved for the Australian economy. Local government understands this only too well, because Labor is certainly the best friend of local government—probably in the history of this nation. Bike paths, community halls and local libraries—local government projects that would have sat gathering dust with the RLCIP—are able to be built thanks to the federal government. On the topic of local government, I record my congratulations to the new Mayor of Gosford, Laurie Maher. He has my best wishes and I look forward to working closely with him.
