        I'd like to finish the year on a positive note. The 2020 Ross Vasta Christmas Appeal has only one week to go, and I would like to thank everyone who has donated so far. This year I partnered with national online charity GIVIT to provide much-needed support to families in Bonner. Christmas is always a hard time for people who are struggling financially, exacerbated by the economic impacts of COVID-19. Sadly, GIVIT has seen a significant increase in the number of people needing help, including many who have never needed to ask for help before.
       </p>
       <p>
        With many families in my electorate still doing it tough, it has been nothing short of overwhelming to see the community come together to support those families who may be looking at a very different kind of holiday season. By partnering with GIVIT, who work with charities in Bonner, we are able to recognise those families in need of support and ensure that 100 per cent of the funds go directly to helping them during this difficult time.

        appeal is supporting not only families but small businesses as well, with all donations being used to buy essential items and gift cards from Bonner's local businesses. Our small businesses are run by hardworking local families. As well as utilising their goods and services during this appeal, I would like to encourage everyone to go local first and support them over the holiday season. To anyone wishing to donate to my Christmas appeal, jump onto my website or Facebook to find out more.
