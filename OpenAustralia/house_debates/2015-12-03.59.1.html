       <p>
        In the lead-up to Christmas I cannot help but think about the negative impact a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        would have on families at this particular time of year. This mean-spirited government is hell-bent on punishing the families of Australia, and a GST is one way to deliver that sort of punishment. I received a letter today from one of my constituents. He and his wife are pensioners but fortunately they own their own home—if they had to purchase one, they would have to pay a GST on that. Their individual income is $16,445 per annum, which is half the minimum wage. They need to draw down an extra $20,000 a year to be able to survive. They can see just how bad this GST will be for them. Even with the minimal amount of GST compensation, they will still be in a much worse position—and they are like thousands and thousands of pensioners throughout Australia. And families will feel this even more. Families with young children are buying Christmas presents and getting ready to go back to school. It is an absolute disgrace and this government should hang its head in shame!
