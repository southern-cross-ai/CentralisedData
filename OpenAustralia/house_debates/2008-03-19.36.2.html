         That the amendments be agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has moved amendments to the
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2906" rel="nofollow">
          Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008
         </a>
         . The government brought this bill to the House having worked extensively over January with the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subset organisation, the Committee on Industrial Legislation. This was a consultative and collaborative process which had been shunned by the former government. The former government refused to acknowledge that there may be views and assistance available from stakeholders. We took a very different approach. The bill was drafted quickly because we wanted to honour our commitment to the Australian people to end Australian workplace agreement making as soon as possible. As the bill has made its way through the parliament and through the process of the Senate inquiry—which we supported, provided it was conducted in a timely fashion—it has become apparent in discussions with stakeholders that it is convenient to amend the bill in a number of respects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments before the House today are in four categories. There are a number of amendments which are strictly technical in nature. There are some amendments to clarify the full range of protection for outworkers. There are some amendments to clarify that the long service leave entitlements of employees stemming from state law will be taken into account for the purpose of the no disadvantage test. There are some amendments to ensure that if an employer was using Australian workplace agreements in December last year and they seek to engage an employee who has formerly worked for them, then they will be able to offer them an interim transitional employment agreement. The government had considered this question earlier. We were concerned that, without a robust anti-avoidance provision, there was some possibility that a provision of this nature could be used by the very occasional employer to terminate people in order to re-engage them on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITEA" rel="nofollow">
          ITEA
         </a>
         s. We obviously did not want that effect. We have looked at the question, and I am now satisfied we have been able to draft a sufficiently robust anti-avoidance provision. We have dealt with the question in those circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regarding the amendments, they have improved and strengthened the bill, which clearly brings to the parliament and brings to the Australian people our promises to end Australian workplace agreement making. Of course, I anticipate that the opposition will say, in respect of the amendments, that they are an indication that the government needed to amend the bill. I would counsel the opposition, if it is going to make those points, that the number of government amendments that the government is making to this bill is smaller than the number of government amendments made by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations when he brought to this House the so-called fairness test. On that occasion, of course, the government moved 44 government amendments. That is greater than the number of government amendments moved on this occasion, which are 37 in number. I am satisfied that this has strengthened the bill. It has brought to the parliament a bill that implements the government’s policy. I commend it to the House.

         <p>
          This must be a humiliating backdown for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. On Tuesday, in a highly dismissive manner—in the high-handed, arrogant manner that is becoming a hallmark of this government—the minister accused me of ‘content-less filibuster’, as I sought to point out the flaws, the inadequacies and the complexities in the government’s
          <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2906" rel="nofollow">
           Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008
          </a>
          . But oh, no—the minister would have none of it. Thirty-seven amendments later, the inconsistencies, the inadequacies and the complexities have been exposed for all to see. I pointed out to the minister the significant problems that the mining and construction sector faced because of uncertainty over employees on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
           AWA
          </a>
          s. I asked what would happen to those workers under Labor’s laws. Given the project-by-project basis of employment in these sectors and the evidence from the Senate inquiry—and it took the coalition to force a Senate inquiry—I took the minister to that precise evidence from the construction and mining sector. She just dismissed it out of hand.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is clear that there would be workers under Labor’s proposed laws who would not be able to be re-employed under an AWA, could not then be employed under one of Labor’s individual contracts and then would have to fall back on the awards. If there were no applicable award, they would have to fall back to the minimum wage and the National Employment Standards. That is the position that the Labor government presented as its legislation, and that is the position that the Senate inquiry’s dissenting report said was untenable. In relation to the Senate report: isn’t it an interesting fact that the majority report from the Labor senators contained all of the evidence about the inconsistencies, the complexities and the uncertainties but made not one recommendation to amend the bill? Obviously, somebody has pulled someone else into line—somebody has overridden the minister’s high-handed attitude towards this bill. There were workers in the construction and mining sector who would have been left in an abyss, according to the evidence, but the minister just dismissed my concerns—dismissed them out of hand. The government has now backed down and moved amendments to address the very issues that were so arrogantly dismissed in this place.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government’s amendments on interim individual contracts now present the following regime. We have a new individual contract introduced by Labor. We now have the situation where the cohort of workers to whom these new Labor individual contracts can be offered has been extended to workers who would not previously have been able to access them, so we have had an extension of the range of employees that can be offered Labor’s individual contracts. We know, through the evidence given at the inquiry and the minister’s admissions in this House, that not only can existing AWAs exist indefinitely but also there are now new, broadened, enhanced individual contracts that can continue indefinitely. If the employee and employer are happy with the terms and conditions of such a contract, they can extend its life indefinitely. It is not true, as Labor keeps suggesting, that there will be no individual statutory agreements in Australian workplaces after 2010 or even 2012—they can go on indefinitely. If these agreements are so evil, as the minister keeps contending, why is Labor introducing its own individual contracts and, through these amendments, extending their reach? Because it knows that choice and flexibility in the workplace have led to greater employment opportunities and greater productivity and respond to the needs and circumstances of 21st century workplaces. Why else is Labor introducing its own individual contract, enhancing that contract’s reach and ensuring that it can continue indefinitely?
         </p>
         <p>
          In one of the most extraordinary developments in the Senate last night, the Labor senators voted to retain the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
           Work Choices
          </a>
          unfair dismissal laws. Labor senators voted to retain the status quo. In other words, Labor wants to hold on to the Work Choices unfair dismissal laws. They were given an opportunity by the Democrats to roll back the unfair dismissal laws that the minister says present an opportunity for employers to dismiss workers.

            Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008
           </a>
           marks a major day for working families right across Australia. Today we declare Australian workplace agreements to be dead and buried. Today we declare this shameful chapter in the history of Australia’s workplace relations to be dead and buried. And today, with this legislation, we begin the process of burying the rest of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
            Work Choices
           </a>
           omnibus once and for all. With this legislation we take the first step towards the creation of a modern, fair and flexible workplace relations system.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government was elected on a commitment to abolish
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
            AWA
           </a>
           s. Today the government honours that commitment. There will be no more AWAs. Basic conditions will never again be stripped away from working families without a dollar of compensation, and a genuine safety net is agreed. I am especially proud today that the members of the parliamentary Labor Party are here to support the passage of this legislation through the parliament. Support in the parliament through the debate came from the member for Bennelong, the member for Blair, the member for Bonner, the member for Braddon, the member for Corangamite, the member for Dawson, the member for Deakin and the members for Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Forde, Hasluck, Kingston, Leichhardt, Lindsay, Longman, Macquarie, Makin, Moreton, Page, Petrie, Robertson, Solomon and Wakefield. Why are they here? They are here because the previous members for those seats failed one simple test—to stand up with courage in defence of the interests of working families. They were prepared to sacrifice the wellbeing of working families under financial pressure to their ideological approach to industrial relations, which would shred the most basic protections which working families expect of this parliament. The previous members who represented those seats would now simply rue the day that they stood in this place and backed Work Choices legislation, because Work Choices was not explained to the Australian people prior to the previous election. They got control of the House of Representatives and control of the Senate, and off they went in pursuit of their ideological folly. And they have paid the price for so doing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australians in all these electorates and all around the country have sent us here to pass this law and to end the unfairness of AWAs that require longer working hours and pay less per hour than collective agreements; that in their thousands and tens of thousands have taken hundreds of thousands out of the pay packets of working men and women; that took away rest breaks, penalty rates, overtime pay and shift loadings; and that, according to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
            Bureau of Statistics
           </a>
           , on average compared to collective agreements took $87 per week out of the pay packets of women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today is just the first step towards a modern workplace relations system that is consistent with core Australian values. The good news for Australians working in shops, hotels, offices, restaurants, nursing homes and other workplaces all over Australia is that AWAs are now dead and buried. This is good news, not just for these working Australians but for their husbands, wives and kids and for working families right across Australia. This is good news for the hardworking Australians who have built a strong economy and who have the right to expect that a strong economy will deliver for all Australians, not just for some. This goes to the heart of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           . This is the Labor way; this is the Australian way—having fairness in the workplace; rewarding hard work, achievement and success; and valuing Australian working families on the way through. With this bill we deliver exactly what we promised prior to the last election—to give a decent and fair go to all working families under financial pressure throughout Australia, not just to some of them. This bill was the first order of business for this Australian government. That is why the first bill that this government has introduced into the House deals with these important matters for working families. That is why we on this side of the parliament stand with pride, having brought this legislation to this parliament and ensured its passage despite the extraordinary backflips that we have seen on the part of those opposite. I commend this bill to the House.

            I have a very simple question for this Prime Minister: will the Prime Minister guarantee that no worker will be worse off under Labor’s industrial relations laws? Will the Prime Minister guarantee that no worker will be worse off under Labor’s industrial relations regime? The Prime Minister will not answer that question. The Prime Minister will deliberately avoid fronting the Australian public and admitting that workers will be worse off under these industrial relations laws. Three times in the Senate last night Senator Wong, the minister’s representative in the Senate, was asked the very simple question: will workers be worse off under Labor’s industrial relations laws? Are you tired, Prime Minister? Are you finding this tedious?

              The fact is that the minister has refused to give precisely the guarantee that Labor insisted
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
               John Howard
              </a>
              give. It is precisely the same question, and no-one on the Labor front bench—not the Prime Minister, not the minister and not her representative in the Senate—will come clean and admit to the Australian public who is going to be worse off under these industrial relations laws. They have done no economic modelling. They have done no analysis at all of the impact on unemployment. The Australian people need to understand the fraud that has been exposed by the 37 amendments that have now been moved by the government to their own legislation. The minister so dismissively said the bill was going to be delivered in full and in whole—but, no, that is not the case 37 amendments later. The fraud that has been exposed is that Labor have not delivered what they promised. Labor are keeping individual statutory contracts. You can call them what you like. They are keeping individual statutory contracts under these amendments. They have broadened the reach of those contracts so that more workers can be offered individual contracts—not fewer. This is not what you went to the election with. They voted last night to retain the

              unfair dismissal laws—an extraordinary outcome. The minister had been going on in this House saying, ‘Employers just want to sack good workers for no reason.’ Those were her words. What an extraordinary statement, as if good workers can be sacked for no reason. She is suggesting, and demonising employers around the country—

                She is nodding. The minister is at the table and nodding that she says employers around this country are scouring their workplaces to find good workers to sack for no reason. They are your words, Minister. No wonder business confidence in the government’s policies has collapsed. When you have a minister who attacks business relentlessly and says they are scouring the workplaces for good workers to sack, we know that the Labor Party’s industrial relations regime is in disarray.

                  industrial relations laws should remain. If the Labor Party are so concerned about the Work Choices unfair dismissal laws, when they had the opportunity to support the Democrats one-page amendment that took out 100 and put in 15—that is how simple it is—why did the Labor senators vote to retain it? What we have seen today are 37 amendments. This is not the legislation that Labor promised the Australian public they would introduce. They have listened to the concerns of the Senate inquiry, for which I am grateful, but the high-handed, dismissive attitude of this government is here for everyone to see. They have not got rid of individual contracts; they are extending them. They have voted to maintain the Work Choices unfair dismissal laws. Labor’s industrial relations policy is a fraud on the Australian public.
