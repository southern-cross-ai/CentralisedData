        Harwood Cricket Club will celebrate a major milestone on 26 August, with the club celebrating its 150th birthday. Special guests at the event will include former Australian umpire

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        in charge of all coaching. The senior premier league, now captained by Nathan Ensbey, has been part of the Clarence River Cricket Association's premier league competition since the mid-nineties, winning eight premierships since 2001, with five of those in the last eight seasons. The event will be held at the Maclean Bowling Club on 26 August at 6 pm, and I can't wait.

        This month the Lismore Base Hospital Auxiliary and the Nimbin Hospital Auxiliary are both celebrating major milestones. Lismore is celebrating 100 years of fundraising for its local hospital and Nimbin 70 years for its hospital. The national united hospital auxiliary movement began 80 years ago. The fact that the Lismore auxiliary is celebrating its 100th year not only shows the ongoing strength and dedication of the branch; it also reveals the foresight and dedication of its founding membersâ€”a spirit that continues to live 100 years on, and one, I'm sure, that will continue for many years to come. Their first fundraiser was a tea tent at the local agriculture show. Morning tea was one shilling and the lunch two shillings. Last year, the Lismore auxiliary donated almost $80,000 to purchase a Mindray machine for anaesthetic services and three external pacing boxes. The Nimbin Hospital Auxiliary donated more than $33,000 last financial year to the Nimbin Multi Purpose Centre. Items purchased included lounges, a bladder scanner, lift chairs, a spirometer, a mobile lifter and various other items. I'd like to thank and congratulate the members and the executive of both auxiliaries for the effort they put into making a wonderful community that much better: Lismore executive president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Miller" rel="nofollow">

        ; treasurer, Lynette Duncan; and assistant treasure Clyde Havilah; and the Nimbin branch president, Maureen Lombard; secretary, Margaret McQuilty; treasurer, Robin Roos; vice-presidents, Margret Linton and Laura Moffit; assistant treasurer, Louise Donadel; and Bev Gardner. Well done. Thank you.
