        I have only been a parliamentarian for about nine months, and I wish to raise an issue that is very near and dear to my heart and to the people of Fisher. About five men and two women will commit suicide today—and tomorrow, and the day after that. Seven Australians will take their own lives day in, day out. Mental health, or the lack thereof, costs our national community, our national economy, $60 billion a year. That is the economic cost. But, when you look at the cost to families, when you look at the cost to lives, it is not just the person who suffers the mental illness that is impacted; it is their mum, their dad, their brothers and sisters, their daughters and sons. Hundreds of thousands of people are being impacted by mental illness in this country on a daily basis. It is a great blight on our community, and it perhaps says something about our lack of village atmosphere and how we live in large cities these days.

        I am very proud to advise the House that on Tuesday night the Treasurer announced funding of $5 million for the Thompson Institute, which is a brain and neuroscience institute based in my electorate of Fisher on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . The Thompson Institute was established as an offshoot of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         University of the Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        , and it was set up and funded initially by a local couple, philanthropists Roy and Nola Thompson. They tipped in $10 million out of their own pocket to fund this institute—they actually gave them the building—the university put in $10 million, and until Tuesday there had been no funding from the federal government. The federal government has now committed to spending $5 million, and I want to thank from the bottom my heart the health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the Treasurer for their support of the Thompson Institute.
       </p>
       <p>
        This $5 million will go into groundbreaking research. This sort of research is done only in a handful of places around the world. It will go into three programs. The first is in relation to the treatment and research of dementia; the second is in relation to youth mental health; and the third is in relation to suicide prevention. My family has been impacted directly by mental illness. I know all too well, all too painfully, what mental illness does to families, and I know that many, many other Australians do as well. The federal government's commitment of $5 million to the Thompson Institute will go a great way towards groundbreaking research and treatment of people who are suffering from ailments such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        , depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. It is a little-known fact that people suffering eating disorders, out of all mental illnesses, have the highest morbidity rates. It almost took my daughter's life. I am so pleased to see that the Thompson Institute will be involved in this groundbreaking research.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank so much Sir Angus Houston, who paired with me in advocating for the Thompson Institute; Roy and Nola Thompson, as I have said;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bennett" rel="nofollow">

        , who is also on the board; and of course the director, Jim Lagopoulos, who has been instrumental in this program. Thank you.
