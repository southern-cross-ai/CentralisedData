        Australia is being tested once again. The east coast of Australia, predominantly

        but, I stress, also South-East Queensland, has faced an extraordinary deluge over recent days. In many places, rains are expected for at least the next 24 to 48 hours, but I fear worse. In South-East Queensland there has been intense rainfall, with more than 300

        requests for assistance over the 24 hours to this morning, with crews working through the night. The

         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        has issued a severe weather warning for western and southern Queensland from this afternoon, which could extend to the south-east coast tomorrow morning. A number of flood warnings remain in place for parts of the state also.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some parts of New South Wales are experiencing the worst flooding in over 50 years, and worse. From Penrith to the north of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">

        In northern New South Wales there are 35 communities isolated. Those communities include Taree, Bellingen, Wingham, Harrington and Laurieton. Across New South Wales 1,400 SES first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance. This is very difficult and dangerous work. I want to acknowledge, pay tribute to and say thank you to, on behalf of all of us here in this place, our volunteers and the emergency services for their extraordinary efforts in responding to these terrible events.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is serious risk still ahead. Heavy rainfall is likely to continue up much of the eastern half of New South Wales and into southern Queensland today and tomorrow. Heavy falls will also develop over northern and central inland parts of New South Wales tomorrow, bringing the risk of flash and significant river flooding to several additional catchments. A different low-pressure system is expected to form off the southern New South Wales coast, bringing rainfall there also. Thankfully, the current forecast has conditions easing statewide from early Wednesday, but we will watch and see.
       </p>

        I want to assure residents in all storm and flood affected areas that all parts of government are working closely together. Premier Berejiklian and I have been in regular contact over the weekend, and indeed again today. Yesterday the director-general of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Management Australia
        </a>
        activated COMDISPLAN in anticipation of New South Wales requesting Australian government non-financial assistance. We are expecting a formal request from New South Wales for ADF support today; that is our expectation. We understand this is likely to be for recovery support and clean-up operations, including personnel, vehicles and machinery.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         The Premier
        </a>
        and I were discussing that over the weekend. We have just been advised now, in discussions, of the potential for heavy lift aerial support, but this is still to be scoped. This has been advised to Defence, and we will be following this up throughout the course of this day. At this point no formal requests have been made.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ADF is readying itself for this task that still lays ahead, particularly in the recovery phase. It is working closely with New South Wales emergency services to coordinate potential areas of assistance. The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery Allowance have been activated to support those who have been affected, suffering significant losses or serious injury or whose income has been affected. The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment provides non-means tested—I stress that—payments of $1,000 for eligible adults and $400 for eligible children.
       </p>
       <p>
        In affected communities Services Australia are deploying to provide on-the-ground assistance. Services Australia disaster assistance phone lines are open from 8 am to 8 pm. The number is: 1800 22 66. Further details are available at the www.disasterassist.gov.au website. Payments for disaster recovery assistance were initiated yesterday by Services Australia. Thirty-four local government areas are now eligible for those payments but I suspect there will be more.
       </p>
       <p>
        We stand ready to do more to provide whatever additional support is needed, in partnership with the New South Wales and Queensland governments as necessary. This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous. We are meeting regularly to be updated on the events and to direct our response. We are grateful that no lives have been lost so far. But weakened foundations for buildings, for roads and for trees all create risk, as do downed power lines and rising water levels. We ask all Australians in these affected areas to please use caution. Check in on your neighbours and those who you know are alone. Please heed the advice of authorities. Where there are orders to evacuate please follow them.
       </p>
       <p>
        As is appropriate at this time many members are supporting their communities and are not here in this place. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Emergency Management, the Minister for Government Services and other ministers are reaching out and working closely with members, mayors, other agencies and communities ensuring they receive every support.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will be a very difficult week for hundreds of thousands of Australians, if not more, as we face the immediacy of the floods. There will be many difficult months ahead as the clean up and recovery from this natural disaster gets underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have very competent agencies in our state governments. They are very good at dealing with these types of emergencies. They are doing a tremendous job right now. The Australian government is standing together with them in ensuring that they can be delivering in this most urgent of times. But, above all, we rely, as we have now for a long time, on Australians themselves. They have shown, as we have come together, we can get through these things when we work together, and that is what we will do in the hours, days, weeks and months ahead, responding to this disaster like those before it and then rebuilding and recovering afterwards.

         Right now some of our fellow Australians are wondering when they're going to get a break. Many have lived through drought. Then came the fires. Then the pandemic and now this flood. From Kempsey to Bulahdelah to

         we know only too well the spectacle of sandbags being stacked in a race against time; boats making their way along submerged streets; families doing the swift, brutal arithmetic about what is important enough to take with them, how much space they have and how much time they have. Then there is that poor couple on their wedding day watching on helplessly as their home literally washed away. Like the bushfires, the floods have had a terrible familiarity. But, as with the fires, we should be concerned that records are being broken. Some are records that've stood untouched for longer than most of us have been alive. And it's not over yet. The rain keeps coming, falling on to already waterlogged ground that can't take so much as another drop.
        </p>
        <p>
         We can always be confident that our national character will not be found wanting when it is put to the test. But it is being put to the test so often. Once again, we're seeing how the worst of times bring out the best in our fellow Australians—neighbour helping neighbour, friend helping friend, stranger helping stranger. The spirit of community was summed up well by Emma-Jane Garrow, who is dealing with the flooding in Hawkesbury instead of setting up a 10-year-old daughter's birthday party. As she told

         working through the darkness, in wind and pouring rain, as the waters keep rising, putting themselves in harm's way for the sake of their fellow Australians, rescuing people and keeping people informed. I join with the Prime Minister in saying: follow their advice. Work from home if you can. We've got a lot better at that over the last year. Try to stay off the roads. Don't risk driving through floodwater. Even what looks like a shallow flow can be deceptive in its strength. Don't put yourself or others in danger. If you're asked to leave, please leave.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered. Our gratitude goes out to everyone who is making this situation better than it might have been. There is more to go, but if Australians have shown anything it is that we have what it takes.
