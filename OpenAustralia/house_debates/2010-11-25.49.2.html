       <p>
        Given the most recent events in this place—extraordinary events—I intend to make a very brief contribution to this debate, and I apologise from here to the French ambassador, who is currently waiting to have a conversation with me. I have heard the word ‘tumultuous’ used a number of times this morning in respect of the year almost past. It certainly has been that: an unusual election, an excruciating 17-day period while we waited for the fate of the various parties to be determined and then almost five weeks of parliamentary sittings under the so-called new paradigm in an environment where no major party or grouping has an absolute majority in this place. That has been tough but I am very pleased to be able to say, and obviously I have a very close view of these things as the Chief Government Whip, that the parliament has been functioning exceptionally well and good government is being delivered to the Australian people. There are many reasons why the parliament and government have functioned well. The greatest credit goes to our Prime Minister, who has proved to be an outstanding leader and a person willing to talk with all sides of the parliament to secure the necessary consensus to get her government’s legislation through the parliament. So I pay tribute to her efforts, her strong leadership and her great skill. Both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business deserve credit. Again, it has been difficult. In many ways we all have our training wheels on, given the new standing orders, and it will take some time before we all fully understand the consequences of some of those changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are learning every day and, as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Selection, like you are, Mr Speaker, no-one understands that better than me and that goes for all of my colleagues on that committee. On that point I want to pay tribute to the secretary of the committee, Robyn McClelland. I think she has been given the toughest job in the parliament. I joked to the Clerk that I suspected maybe he had some reason to dislike Ms McClelland, because I did not know what she could have done to deserve such a tough gig. She has played that role exceptionally well and, if I may, I congratulate her on behalf of the committee. I want to pay tribute to the crossbenchers. I think not only have they made a significant contribution to the place but they have approached the new rules, the new standing orders and the new arrangements with a great deal of credibility and in a responsible way. It is a credit to them that they have been able to do so in that fashion. I want to mention also the staff of all those people whom I have mentioned, including the staff who guide both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business, many of whom have been named this morning and this afternoon and I will not go through them again. Of course, I want to thank my staff and my fellow whips. I came to the Chief Government Whip’s job with no experience in the role and I would have undoubtedly been all at sea if it were not for the guidance of the member for Shortland and the member for Fowler. Of my staff the best known is Anna George, the whips’ clerk, who really runs the show. Having come to the job with training wheels on, I could not have survived even the first hour without Anna’s advice, support and guidance. My thanks go also to Natasa Sikman and Jay Suvaal, who are both new to the job and are doing outstanding work, which I appreciate very much. I also appreciate the work of the staff of my fellow whips.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have been mentioned before so, in a way, there is no need to do it again, but I do want to acknowledge the Clerk and his team. They are also doing wonderful work in the most difficult of circumstances, given the nature of the new standing orders and how they are playing out. Like others, I want to thank the Serjeant-At-Arm’s Office, Comcar, the chamber attendants, those who work in security, the cleaners, the gardeners, those who organise our travel, all committee staff and those who operate the gym. The gym is very important in the hung parliament. We cannot afford to have anything but very healthy members; and I encourage all members to make better use of the gymnasium, although not necessarily in periods when divisions are likely. I want to thank those in the Nurses’ Centre, the physios, those who provide
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        support—it is very, very important in the 21st century—and those who feed us at places like Aussies and the staff cafe and in the dining room.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just close by associating myself with the words of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and others in reference to those who are serving with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        on overseas operations. I had the experience of going to both Iraq and Afghanistan on the eve of Christmas 2007, so I have a really good sense of what they are thinking and feeling at the moment as they contemplate Christmas without their families. It is a tough thing and a great tribute to their dedication to their work. We are eternally grateful to them. I reflect on those we have lost in Afghanistan—tragic losses. We reflect on people who have been prepared to take significant risk and to risk the ultimate sacrifice under the Australian flag. I know I speak for all members of the House when I say we are eternally grateful for their contribution and we assure their families and friends that we will never forget their deeds. I wish a merry Christmas to everyone.

        <p>
         I join with those that have preceded me in thanking everyone associated with this parliament for all the effort they have put in over the last 12 months. It has been an extraordinary 12 months, not least because St George won the premiership, as the Attorney-General would appreciate. I was just reflecting on a conversation with the father of the House, the member for Berowra. I asked him if he had seen such a tumultuous year since he first came here in 1973, when I was eight years of age. I think at time even Wyatt Roy’s parents might not have been born.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been an extraordinary year in the history of the parliament, and no less and probably more significant than any other year in politics since 1901. We have had two leaders of the opposition, two prime ministers, and an incredibly hard-fought election that resulted in the first hung parliament since 1941. We have seen some very important milestones in the new parliament—the first
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australian
         </a>
         elected to the House of Representatives, the first Muslim Australian elected to the House of Representatives, the youngest Australian ever elected to the House of Representatives and the direct re-election of a female Prime Minister—all in the space of just a few months. It is significant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Normally this time of the year is a moment of upheaval, whether you are in government or opposition. They have referred to it as the killing season in the media but, in the period between 2003 and 2009, there have been six leadership changes in Australian politics either before or just after the summer period. I am very sure—although I have said this before—that on this occasion we will not see that happen, thankfully; and Australia will have a stable political environment for some months to come. The fact is that we still manage to have a stable political environment despite occasional upheaval within this chamber. Much of that stability is delivered by the fact that we have set formats that the Australian people expect us ultimately to deliver for them. In that regard, I want to thank all the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate for all of their contributions to that stability over the last 12 months, given that there could have been a period of incredible instability for the Australian people, particularly in the aftermath of the recent election.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been a significant year for the economy. I fear that 2011 will be a rough ride, not particularly for Australia but on a global basis in particular for Portugal, Spain and Greece—and the challenge of what Ireland is going through at the moment. The massive increase in the supply of sovereign debt is going to represent a funding challenge for the world and particularly for Australia, which is a net importer of capital. Therefore, we cannot lose sight of the challenges that not just our economy but also our financial system is going to face in 2011. But now is not the time to focus on that. I do want to wish my direct opponent, the Treasurer Wayne Swan and his wife Kim, all the very best for Christmas. I want to wish the much loved Speaker Harry Jenkins and his wife Michelle all the very best for Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
         To my leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott
         </a>
         , Margie and his three daughters I would say that Australia has not seen a more formidable Leader of the Opposition. He is someone who brought down a Prime Minister and nearly brought down a second Prime Minister in a matter of months. He managed to take us from what was, 12 months ago next Wednesday, an extraordinary period in the Liberal Party and I will not forget that date in a hurry. Tony Abbott’s contribution over the last 12 months has been nothing short of exceptional. I join with my colleagues in praising him for what has been a most formidable performance in Australian politics.

           Anyone that puts up with us for 12 months, let alone for many more than that, is quite an exceptional person. To all of the Liberal Party organisation I say that everyone keeps writing the Liberal Party off but, my goodness, it is the most formidable political machine in Australia. To

           , Robert Arrell and all of the team: thank you so much for helping me to be re-elected. As for so many others in this place, the swing gets bigger the less time you spend in the electorate. That is what I discovered in this election campaign. I am sure I will get my very best swing in my favour when I am never there. It sounds as though that is going to be sorely tested over the next 72 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
           To you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, all the very best for what should be a rather cool Tasmanian summer over the Christmas period. To all the people of Australia: I wish you the best, and I will say a bit more about this in the MPI, if Mr Speaker should so accept it.

           It is at Christmas time that we reflect on what we have and what we do not have. We have a new tradition in our household at Christmas involving the three children. I have now managed to convince the kids that the snow turns into flour on Christmas morning, so it proves Santa has been to the house. For a lot of Australians Santa is not coming, therefore we should think very carefully about the people who are going to miss out this Christmas—and there will be many like that. Whether it be the widows of the diggers that died in Afghanistan, or the widows and family of the miners that died in

           </a>
           or just family who are not here this year—fathers, brothers, sisters or, God forbid, children—for many people it is a pretty tough time at Christmas.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the journey of life and thank God that we live in a great nation that affords stability and opportunity but most significantly gives all of our people hope that they can forge a better life. Everyone in this place—I say this emphatically—wants our nation in 2011 to be a better place than 2010. In that regard I hope that everyone has a well-earned break and begins 2011 with a spirit of determination to make Australia an even greater country.

           <p>
            I rise to say that it is a great pleasure to be back in this place. Three years ago when I rolled my swag and decided that I was going to call it quits, being back here today giving a valedictory a couple of months after re-emerging as the member for Leichhardt was the last thing I anticipated. I want to take the opportunity to say thank you to quite a number of people who make my life a lot easier in this place and provide a tremendous amount of assistance to ensure from our side the smooth working of the parliament.
           </p>
           <p>
            The coalition now holds more seats than any other party within the parliament, and I think that every single coalition member sitting in this House today needs to be very proud of themselves in their dedication and what they have achieved in this short period of time. This new paradigm, more than any other previous parliament, has been essential to an effective and workable relationship with those on the other side of the political realm, particularly in relation to the tightness of our numbers. The importance of not missing a division and being in the House on time is paramount on both sides. It certainly could mean the difference between a vote getting up and a vote being lost.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly, I would like to acknowledge
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
             Joel Fitzgibbon
            </a>
            , the Chief Government Whip. We certainly do not agree on everything and often go in to bat for our side of politics, but I have to say that we do have a very solid working relationship. I appreciate the high level of cooperation that I get from Joel; it certainly helps to make things run a lot more smoothly as a result. I would like to thank not only Joel but his staff. Our staff have a regular interaction. His staff, led by Anna, do a great job in working together, and I look forward to that relationship continuing. I stand here, but without the support of my staff there is no way in the world I could do the job that I was given. When I won the seat of Leichhardt again, the last thing I expected was to be offered the position of Chief Opposition Whip. It is not something that I had aspired to. On taking up the role, and in the years I have been in this place, I note that it is the first time we have seen such a balance of numbers and, subsequently, it has provided some challenges. Probably more than I have, my staff, my Canberra staff in particular, Nathan Winn, Suzanne Newbury and Joshua See, have done a wonderful job in making sure that there has been a smooth transition from one opposition whip to another. To Kylie Hart, who keeps me on time and makes sure that the diary works well, and Danae Jones, who does her best to try to keep my profile in the media, you do an outstanding job.

            To my electorate staff, who have to spend more time there because I am away, Jaki Gothard and Corrie Donaghey and Natasha Sambo, and Temira Creek-Dewis, who works in my office in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
             Torres Strait
            </a>
            , it is a credit to them that they are able to keep that office functioning. All the good work that they do there reflects very positively on me. At this point I would like to acknowledge that they are the ones who do the work and who really deserve a lot of the credit for an outstanding job. They are all very new. For most of my staff, this is the first time they have worked in an electorate office. It has been a bit of a challenge at times but they have adapted very well and are learning very quickly. I am very proud of the commitment they have shown me in the roles they play on a daily basis and the support they give me to ensure that we have overall functionality in this place.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chief Opposition Whip, as a figurehead, if you like, has the support of some other great people who need to be acknowledged. I refer to my fellow whips, the member for Forrest, the member for Parkes, the member for Hinkler and the member for Barker. Patrick, in particular, has an outstanding understanding of standing orders and I would be somewhat lost without having him there to refer to on a regular basis. They all do an outstanding job in their capacities as opposition whips. I think we should also recognise their respective staff in Megan Smith, Vicki Riggio, Kate Barwick and Sarah Johnston. They do make coming to work in this busy environment an absolute pleasure. Knowing that you have such a great team to back you up certainly makes a big difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to thank the honourable member for Fairfax, who was the former Chief Opposition Whip. He served the party well during his time as whip. He is a very good friend of mine. He did an outstanding job and left behind some seriously large shoes to fill. He managed to be not only a whip who was highly respected by his colleagues but also a confidant to many within the party during some very trying times over the past couple of years. I understand that the member for Fairfax has announced that this will be his final term in the parliament and I would like to pay tribute to him. I wish him well in his final term, along with his wife, Jenny, and their family. I thank them for their support over the many years that I served with him. Certainly while I will miss him in the parliament I will be looking forward to catching up with him from time to time.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this time I would also like to acknowledge the Leader of the House and, especially, the Manager of Opposition Business for their ability to maintain an effective working relationship. I should also acknowledge their staff, especially James Newbury, all of whom help us in making sure that this place runs well. I acknowledge Mr Henry Thomson from the Parliamentary Liaison Office for his exceptional leadership and his dedicated team. They serve both the parliament and the executive in a very professional and courteous way and deserve much credit for the fantastic work they do. It certainly is not easy balancing the demands of this place and the executive, but Henry manages to do that fantastically.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Department of Parliamentary Services also does a wonderful job in keeping us supported on a daily basis, ensuring that we have everything that we need to undertake our jobs adequately. We certainly thank you for everything you do. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the clerks, especially the

             Clerk of the House
            </a>
            , Mr Bernard Wright, for his assistance. He and his department do a wonderful job in helping members and their staff in what can be a very hectic place. They have earned some very well deserved rest over the forthcoming summer break.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to pay credit to all of our attendants for the wonderful assistance they provide members and their staff in performing their duties. The Serjeant, Claressa Surtees, and her deputies and assistants, thank you very much indeed for all that you do.

            and the deputy speakers—a good friend of mine, Deputy Speaker Adams, is sitting in the chair at the moment—do an outstanding job in an endeavour to keep us under control in sometimes very difficult and heated debates. I would like to congratulate you all, for the first time publicly, for being elected to your roles. I certainly look forward to working with you in the new parliamentary sittings.
           </p>
           <p>
            I leave the best to last in paying tribute to the Leader of the Opposition for his exceptional leadership. This has been an amazing year for the coalition. Thanks to our leader, we managed to win more seats in the parliament. Under his reign, we certainly stand within a whisker of taking government. This, of course, is the challenge that now lies ahead of us, and I have no doubt that under his leadership a victory will be within our grasp at the next election.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a personal note, I would like to thank a few people who have helped me come back into this place after my three-year break and recognise them for the outstanding work that they have done. I have before recognised Trent Twomey and Dennis Quick, but there are others such as Nicole Tobin-Donnelley,

             Jake Robinson
            </a>
            , Danae Jones, Lisa Dunkerton, Julie Wallis—who did a wonderful job in supporting me during the campaign—and Kate Dewar, and of course everyone else who came forward and offered the support that has provided me with the opportunity to be in this place. I really appreciate their outstanding effort, and again I say that, without their support, the opportunity to be here today would not have eventuated.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a further personal note, I would like to thank my family for their ongoing support—my partner, Elle, and my sons Jacob and Jason. We as federal members of parliament have to commit an enormous amount of time to our roles and spend a lot of time away from our loved ones. Particularly for those of us who live in more remote regional areas or at significant distances from this place, this makes it even more difficult for our families. So I think it is important that we recognise them and thank them for their support. Of course, to my widowed mum, who, again, very rarely sees me but whom I try to keep in touch with, thank you very much indeed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, thanks to all my colleagues in this place who have been very cooperative and supportive. We have been on the job now for only a relatively short period of time, so I think it is fair to say that I have a decent set of training wheels on to learn the job. However, without their cooperation, it would make it a hell of a lot more difficult. I see my neighbour and colleague

              We have a lot of issues that we share and common views in the way that we want to address them. I certainly look forward to working with the member for Kennedy during this term of parliament in trying to address some of those things. I am sure that between the pair of us we can not only certainly raise them but hopefully find some solutions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, I would like to wish everybody a great Christmas. It is a time to reflect and also to spend with family. Christmas can also be a very sad time for some people and a very distressing time for others. If you know someone who is without family or who is away from their home, take the opportunity to open your home and provide them with the opportunity of spending some time with you. That is probably the greatest gift that we can give as we move into the new year. While I would very strongly urge everybody to make the most of this time and to enjoy it immensely, I want you to also understand that moderation is very important. I urge you to take the opportunity of enjoying this time somewhere where you do not have to get out onto the roads, because that is where some of our greatest tragedies occur. So stay at home and enjoy it with your family and friends. I look forward to seeing everyone at the start of the next parliamentary term.
