       <p>
        I welcome the government's announcement to establish a royal commission into aged care. As parliamentarians, we do have a responsibility to resource the aged-care sector. As I said in my maiden speech, we will be judged by the quality of the care that we fund. We need to ensure that appropriate resources, policies and regulations are in place to ensure the proper care of the people who nursed us, taught us and built the country that we have today, which is the lucky country. I've met with many aged-care service providers and workers from

        and have been impressed by their professionalism and dedication and their commitment to the people who they care for and are responsible for. They deliver care that is world class, and I thank them for their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        While there have been some very alarming and very distressing reports of abuse, which we all find absolutely abhorrent, it's important that we don't let these isolated cases affect our respect and regard for people employed in the aged-care sector. The royal commission will expose those who have done the wrong thing. It will help the sector and give everyone the confidence that the most vulnerable people in our community are receiving the care that they need and the care that they deserve.
