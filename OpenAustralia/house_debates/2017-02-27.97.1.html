        I wish to offer the condolences of the parliament to the loved ones of those killed in Victoria's worst civil aviation accident in 30 years. On Tuesday 21 February, just after nine o'clock in the morning, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Super_King" rel="nofollow">

        aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Essendon Airport
        </a>
        . The plane had been chartered by four visitors from the United States and was flown by Max Quartermain, an Australian pilot with over 38 years of flying experience. It was a once-in-a-lifetime trip cut tragically short. Nobody on board survived the impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        We thank the first responders, who once again selflessly and heroically rushed to the scene. To them we offer our deepest gratitude and respect. Again and again Australians show their finer selves in their first response to these terrible accidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The authorities will continue their investigation into the circumstances of the accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who died, both here in Australia and in the United States. On behalf of the parliament and all Australians we offer our sincere sympathies.

         I thank the Prime Minister for his words. My electorate borders three parts of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Essendon Airport
         </a>
         to the west, south and east. We got the news from social media, the way that bad news seems to get out pretty quickly. We saw the pictures of the plume of smoke—very dense, oily and black. Of course, as the Prime Minister has said, it was the death of four American tourists—golfers going to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
          King Island
         </a>
         . Their families had to be informed at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
          Hyatt Hotel
         </a>
         by the police just as the news was still breaking. The pilot, Max Quartermain, was very experienced. This is a terrible tragedy. I know where the plane crashed—it is where we shop. It is where my family goes sometimes—the Essendon
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFO" rel="nofollow">
          DFO
         </a>
         , which I am sure other members would know.
        </p>
        <p>
         The area has had plane crashes in the past. A family was killed in Matthews Avenue. There has been another near miss. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Transport_Safety_Bureau" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Transport Safety Bureau
         </a>
         is going to investigate. I thank both my shadow minister and the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport for keeping us informed. The coroner is going to investigate. It was a catastrophic failure. The plane got up to about 200 feet; a mayday was issued and it banked left. We will find out as best we can what happened from the experts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plane crashes are very uncommon, but when they happen they have an impact on communities which is much more, perhaps, that other tragedies, because we fly and we can imagine it happening, and we can imagine shopping near airports. I also want to say that on that morning I also thought of the Prime Minister. These things bring back memories. I congratulate the first responders. All Australians express our sympathies to the families and to the family of the pilot as well. If that had happened an hour later that DFO would have been a very crowded place. I do not know if there can be solace taken from that. The first responders were outstanding. I hope that we will find out what happened, but today it is about condolences. May they rest in peace.
