       <p>
        It is my pleasure to pay tribute to three ladies: the Pinker sisters—Sue, Catherine and Kim—who were raised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        . Back in 2007, five years ago, Kim was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 31. As a result of this, the sisters were spurred to take action to try and bring about greater awareness of breast cancer within the local community of the Yarra Valley and the broader electorate of Casey, which I represent. Specifically, they wanted to build on the great work being done by many breast cancer organisations. But they wanted to do so in a way that focused attention at the community level—to raise funds in the local community for the local community and to raise awareness as well as dollars.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, they decided to create the Melbourne
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer
        </a>
        Bra Walk. Last year this walk took place in the centre of Melbourne at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Federation Square
        </a>
        and achieved its objectives of raising both money and awareness. This year, it was decided that they would hold the walk locally and they did so on Sunday, 21 October, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillydale_Lake" rel="nofollow">
         Lillydale Lake
        </a>
        —and they did so with more than 240 other participants. I was pleased to be there to participate in the walk and to help the sisters on the day. The money raised from both the walk and from a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIP" rel="nofollow">
         VIP
        </a>
        fundraising night earlier in the week has enabled some very important funds to go to the Maroondah Breast Clinic and to the Yarra Valley Ladies in Pink, who do so much to support those with breast cancer in the Yarra Valley.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to a few people. Narelle King was the auctioneer for the VIP night, which Tamara Lloyd from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_White" rel="nofollow">
         Ray White
        </a>
        in Croydon helped to organise. Jill Rule and her team from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Evelyn
        </a>
        and Montrose Bendigo Bank were sponsors and supporters. Yvette Boase, from Yvette's Facepainting, helped paint the faces of many kids—and a few adults, I have to say—on the day of the walk. Finally, I pay tribute to Sue Calder, one of those sisters who did so much work. She is a true champion of the local community. She did so much work and showed such passion and dedication to bring this great event about. I know she will be very involved in the years to come.
