       <p>
        My electorate of Oxley is proudly served by countless community organisations. Throughout my time as a local representative, I've been continually amazed by the passion and commitment of the volunteers and staff who dedicate their time to service of their local community and to the broader international community. This year, one such organisation will close its doors for the final time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to recognise the many achievements of Ipswich Cares, which was founded by the then councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 2007. This organisation rallied the Ipswich community around important international causes, challenging every resident in Ipswich to donate $1 in the month of September. Since the very start, it has raised over $300,000 for projects and initiatives, which is used to support and implement sustainable projects right around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Ipswich Cares won't be operating post 2021, the legacy will live on right throughout the world in places such as Bali, Rwanda, Vietnam, Egypt, the Philippines and India, to name just a few. It will also live on in the hearts of those who have participated in fundraising and physically worked on each and every project they've travelled to. Whether it's an Ipswich Cares park, a school, water tank or a project installed with the help of the Ipswich community, Ipswich Cares will continue to make a difference in the lives of many. A big thank you to Tracy Bold and the entire team at Ipswich Cares for everything you've done in our community and across the globe. You'll be sorely missed, but I know the spirit of the community will live on for Ipswich for many years to come.
