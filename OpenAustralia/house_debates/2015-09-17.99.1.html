        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House on the government's plans to support pensioners across Australia? How is the government helping pensioners keep up with the cost of living?

          I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. He will be very pleased to know that this Sunday the pension is going up. The pension is going up this Sunday. Despite those opposite claiming that pensions are being cut, that pensions are falling, this Sunday the pension will be going up. But it will not be the first time that it has gone up under this government because already to date the pension has risen by $51.80 for singles and $78 per fortnight for couples.
         </p>
         <p>
          The increases that we have had since this government came to power include: $14.10 for singles and the $21.24 for the carbon tax compensation which we ensured we delivered and we got rid of the carbon tax at the same time. So pensioners, as a result of us being able to deliver those concessions, those increases consistently over time, are $78 better off now for couples and $51.80 for singles. And for the almost 20,000 age pensioners in Canning who will be going to the polls on Saturday, what they need to know is that pensions keep going up under this government and that pensions will be going up on Sunday again. Those opposite like to scare pensioners. Those opposite like to scare them with false campaigns about the government's policies.
         </p>
         <p>
          The contrast today could not have been more significant and more serious. On that side of the House, we had those who were seeking to make light of serious issues and on this side of the House there were sensible answers to sensible questions from our colleagues. Look at the contrast, as I am sure those in Canning will be doing. This has been a difficult week but it has been an important week. While those opposite would seek to sneer and make light, on this side of the House we have been getting on with the job of government. The government is continuing to govern in a sensible and secure way. For those people at home who have looked at the events of this week and had concerns, they should know they have a government that is focused on them and there is a an opposition that is focused only on their cynical political games. As a result, in Canning this weekend they can go to those polls and they will know that their pension is going up on Sunday, that this government will continue to govern in their interest and that they can have full confidence that our focus is 100 per cent on their interests.
