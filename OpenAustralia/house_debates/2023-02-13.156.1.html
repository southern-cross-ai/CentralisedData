        I rise today in this chamber to acknowledge the 15th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations delivered in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        by former prime minister the Hon. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        in 2008. This moment in our country's history was a significant occasion for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people, and overall it was an important step in our nation's path to reconciliation. I am honoured to be in this place, as a proud Wiradjuri man living on Darkinjung country, acknowledging the impact this had on First Nations people and the importance that this apology had for truth-telling about shameful policies of past governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will never forget the moment, as a young teenager in high school, watching Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver the apology. Finally, after years, after decades, a federal government was acknowledging the destructive effects that these policies had, and that they continue to have, on our First Nations people throughout the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I was joined by none other than my grandmother Aunty Robyn Reid, a Wiradjuri elder living on Darkinjung country on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Central Coast
        </a>
        . My grandmother personally met Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today. She got to thank him for his powerful apology 15 years ago, and to tell him how this continues to resonate with our family and for our community. Nan was also very proud to shake Kevin Rudd's hand today, and he was very, very lucky to get that hand back! It was a very big moment for her today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we remember and continue to work towards closing the gap for our First Nations people and our First Nations communities so that together we move forward as a strong and united nation. Australia will be presented with a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the upcoming referendum to recognise our First Nations brothers and sisters in our Constitution and to give First Nations people a voice to parliament. And today, in this chamber, I ask all Australians from all walks of life to vote yes; to vote yes to support the next step in the path for reconciliation, for respect and for unity. Thank you.
