       <p>
        I would like to raise four areas of concern for my constituents within the electorate of Cowan. I am very pleased that I have had the opportunity and I continue to have the opportunity to work with the excellent mayor of the city of Swan, Charlie Zannino, to help with these matters in the east of the electorate of Cowan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I speak of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Reid Highway
        </a>
        and Malaga Drive interchange. Well, it is not an interchange yet, but it certainly should be. I have written to the Minister for Transport, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Buswell" rel="nofollow">
         Troy Buswell
        </a>
        , for his support. An interchange in this area would be very effective. It is a high-volume intersection at the moment with lots of business traffic and lots of private traffic as well. It would be good for local people and local businesses in Malaga and in the suburb of Ballajura. It is also good for safety and the productivity of business in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to raise the issue of the duplication of Gnangara Road. Back in 2007, the Howard government funded majority funding for the continuation and duplication of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        , which now connects to Gnangara Road. Unfortunately, the duplication and the dual carriageway comes to pretty much an abrupt halt when the road is reduced to a lane each way. It would again be good for safety and productivity for Gnangara Road itself to be duplicated as it heads out into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Valley
        </a>
        . Again, I will be meeting with Minister Buswell to speak about the interchange and Gnangara Road.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also written to the Minister for Water regarding the relocation of the chlorine facility at the Mirrabooka waste water facility on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Drive
        </a>
        in Koondoola. By a fairly small movement of the chlorine facility, it would result in the reduction in the chlorine buffer zone that will then free up land adjacent to Paradise Quays across the road in Ballajura. That would allow an aged care facility to be constructed, which would result in a much improved quality of life and a local facility for older Australians within the suburb of Ballajura, again on the east of my electorate of Cowan. I will be meeting with Minister Marmion shortly about that matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would also like to raise the need for a new primary school in the suburb of Lansdale. Lansdale is an area that continues to grow and will double in size within the next few years. Already the current Lansdale Primary School has reached capacity, and shortly I will be meeting with the Minister for Education, the Hon. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Constable" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth Constable
        </a>
        , to talk about the great need for local people within the electorate of Cowan and particularly in the suburb of Lansdale. I look forward to the Minister considering carefully, my and the Lansdale Residents' Association's submission to improve the educational outcomes for local children and local families within Lansdale.
