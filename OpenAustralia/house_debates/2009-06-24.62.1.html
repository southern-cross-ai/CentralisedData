       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in this House on 4 June that his office had made a representation to Treasury on behalf of a Bennelong car dealership in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">
         OzCar
        </a>
        and his claim that ‘What subsequently occurred … I have no idea’. Can the Prime Minister confirm that on 17 April he personally sought and on 21 April his office received a detailed Treasury brief on what subsequently occurred with the Bennelong car dealer, marked ‘For the Prime Minister’. Why did the Prime Minister not inform the House that he had received that brief and will he now correct the record?

        <p>
         Mr Speaker, this desperate Leader of the Opposition is grasping at straws. This is desperation with a capital D. It goes to a matter concerning not Mr Grant but another car dealer with whom I have no relationship whatsoever.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         simply say to the honourable member that, at the time I answered his question, I was unaware of what outcome had occurred in relation to that car dealer, and I stand by the statement that I made at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Can I say to the honourable member, again in his state of continuing denial, that he seems to think that all that is going on in the national debate today about his integrity will just fade away, that it is of no continuing relevance. This entire debate has been about the truthfulness of the honourable gentleman opposite. It goes to the truthfulness of his handling not just of this affair before the events of last week; it goes also to something more fundamental—his handling of the events during the course of this week.
        </p>
        <p>
         I ask honourable members to reflect on this—the whole question of truth. Is it true when he has claimed that he has made, for example, as he has said in recent days, no accusation of corruption in relation to myself? That is false. Is it true when he says that he has never accused me of misleading the parliament? That is false. Mr Speaker, can I say to you: is it true when he says that he has never called for my resignation? Mr Speaker, that is false. Is it true when he claims that Senator Abetz only raised this matter in the Senate after the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
           Daily Telegraph
          </a>
         </i>
         reported the contents of this forged email? That was false, as it was for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as well. Is it true when he says that he did not approach Dr Charlton but that Dr Charlton had approached him? That is false as well, as attested by a journalist who is of some respect and standing in the gallery—Mr Farr of the
         <i>
          Daily Telegraph
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         What is the truth, therefore, about the content, the intensity and the appropriateness of the contact between this Leader of the Opposition and the public servants in question? He refuses to answer those questions. I believe, therefore, that these matters have yet to be fully established. What we do know, however, as an absolute fact is that the email upon which he has based his entire attack on my integrity is a forgery; it is false; it is simply a non basis in fact. Mr Speaker, can I say to those opposite, in particular to the Leader of the Opposition—

           <p>
            Again, Mr Speaker, in the initial response to the question, I dealt with the matters which had been raised by the Leader of the Opposition.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
             Can I
            </a>
            say to the Leader of the Opposition: this entire debate hangs on his credibility to continue in his position. I would say to the member for Bradfield and, in his absence, the member for Higgins: if the Leader of the Opposition does not have the integrity to stand and say that he accepts full responsibility for this entire debacle and to do the decent thing, which is to stand, to apologise and to resign, it is time that those behind him of seniority in the Liberal Party tapped him on the shoulder and told him to his face to do the honourable thing, which is to resign.
