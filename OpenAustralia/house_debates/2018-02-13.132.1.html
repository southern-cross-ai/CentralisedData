        Water infrastructure is just as essential to the agricultural industry and life in regional centres as it is to big cities. Without affordable water, our nation comes to a grinding halt. Water means life. Water means jobs. Water means economic security for the future, both on the land and in the cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the 2016 election, the Turnbull government committed to $130 million funding towards the construction of the Rookwood weir—a project which would not only deliver water but deliver jobs, exports and prosperity to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . Last week the Queensland state government and the opposition finally realised the significance of this project and agreed to fully fund 50 per cent of the project. The federal government has previously committed to funding this project fifty-fifty. Two years ago, the cost of the project was $260 million. It has now jumped to $350 million. Where the extra $90 million came from, I do not know. But it's up to the state government to wear the extra cost of building this weir. Taking a similarly considered approach in the light of the release of the business case is not unreasonable, so we must investigate that. But the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, was in the Gladstone region last week, and he has committed federal government funding if he was to win government at the next election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rookwood weir project and other water infrastructure projects are about delivering economic opportunities for Central Queensland. The economic boost from this single project is forecast to be $1 billion for the region. For example, in 1968, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbairn_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Fairbairn Dam
        </a>
        was built at a cost of $30 million. It's now valued at somewhere between half a billion and a billion dollars, and the Emerald region produces $5.5 billion in exports. That just goes to show the good that water can do for a region. I know the importance of affordable water to the agricultural producers in our nation, so this will not be the only infrastructure project that I will be fighting for for Flynn.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turnbull government is committed to building 100 dams across the nation, knowing water means life, water means jobs, water means security for the future. Farmers along the several rivers that make up the Fitzroy Basin—
