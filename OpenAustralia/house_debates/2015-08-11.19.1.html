       <p>
        As has already been commented, it is six months today since those opposite had their existential crisis, their backbench revolt. It is six months since our Prime Minister survived the leadership ballot—his 'near-death experience', as he called it—and then declared that good government would start from that day. Let us review the progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand here today while 800,000 Australians are unemployed. The highest number in 20 years. Forget about the percentages—these are 800,000 people. Young people turning 21 today are faced with bleak employment prospects under this government and this Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I came in here I heard our Prime Minister giving a press conference. He asked the question: 'How do we create jobs and growth?' He asked that question twice. The member for Hotham has written a book—perhaps he could read it. She has some ideas, along with the member for Gellibrand, about how to create jobs and growth. If this Prime Minister does not have answers, it is time for him to leave this parliament. Let's have a new government. Let's not wait 12 months to have a new government. The people in my electorate deserve it. They deserve jobs, they deserve dignity and they deserve a government that cares.
