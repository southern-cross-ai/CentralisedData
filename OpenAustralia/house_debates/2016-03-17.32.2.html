       <p>
        In accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act, I wish to make a statement on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the appointment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Budget_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Budget Officer
        </a>
        . As the committee responsible for parliamentary oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the appointment of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as proposed by the Presiding Officers, and to approve or reject this proposal. The committee is then required to report to both houses on its decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, I am pleased to inform the parliament that the committee has approved the proposal that Mr Phil Bowen be reappointed as Parliamentary Budget Officer for a further term of 12 months. This term will commence on 23 July 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        The role of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
         PBO
        </a>
        is to inform the parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. The committee's 2014 report on the PBO commended Mr Bowen, the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer, for his leadership in establishing the PBO as a respected source of expert analysis in this regard. The committee believes that Mr Bowen's reappointment will ensure continuity of leadership for the Parliamentary Budget Office during the upcoming federal election period.

         I thank the member for Groom for his contribution. I also take the opportunity to place on record my sincere thanks for his sage advice and wisdom during my time in parliament. I thank him also for his contribution to the parliament and to the Australian people. I want to let him know that I hold him in the highest regard and respect the work he has done.
