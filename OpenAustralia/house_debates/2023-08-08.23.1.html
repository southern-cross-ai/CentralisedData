       <p>
        I was saddened by the sudden passing of Tony Gamson earlier this year. Tony Gamson and his wife, Meegan, have been mainstays of the Arcadia community, organising the annual community dinner. This Saturday night when that community dinner is held, we'll all be a little sadder for Tony's absence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony grew up in our community. His parents owned a house, noted for its parties, that he sold to my in-laws. Tony's name is still on a sticker in the bedroom in which he grew up. Tony's father, David, was the long-serving treasurer of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barker_College" rel="nofollow">
         Barker College
        </a>
        council. Like his father, Tony also served the Barker community. As a student, Tony threw himself into the life of the school. In fact, he did this with such gusto that he had to repeat his final year!
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was a true all-rounder, excelling at basketball, swimming, rugby and drama. Later, he served as the president of the Old Barker Association, as a member of the college council and as chair of the building committee. Tony was a strong supporter of both sports and arts at Barker. He regularly came back to the school to present jerseys and awards to school sports teams, and he rarely missed a drama production.
       </p>
       <p>
        And Tony Gamson was always great fun to be around. Tony's laconic style belied a first-class mind, put to use in investment banking in Sydney, Singapore and Canada. Tony had sound judgement and was always happy to offer encouragement and advice to his local member of parliament! He was a dedicated husband to Meegan and father to Jordan, who gave one of the most spectacular eulogies I think I have ever heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all miss Tony Gamson. May Tony Gamson's memory be a blessing.
