        I'd like to congratulate and give a big shout out to some outstanding volunteers who were honoured in the recent

William Dowling of Bandon Grove received the Environmental Citizen of the Year award for his efforts in several projects in state forests in the Barrington Tops State Conservation Area and working through the Dungog Commons.

       <p>
        Pauline Cambourne and Susan Dillon are also doing great things in the Dungog Shire. They received the Volunteer Service to the Community Award for their efforts at the Dungog growers stall and as secretary of the successful Dungog Tea Partyâ€”which I can say from my own personal experience is an amazing success. Hundreds of people come to Dungog to look at the amazing collection of teapots. Susan has also put in a huge effort for the Paterson River Pony Club for more than twenty years and manages the Gresford canteen.

        In the Port Macquarie Hastings Council awards, local Lake Cathie Public School principal, Jock Garven, was recognised as Joint Citizen of the Year for his hours of volunteer work and the positive impact he is really making. His achievements include out-of-hours youth bands HATCH and HATCHlings, creating the Big Band Blast in 2013 with Jazz musician
