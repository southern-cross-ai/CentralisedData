        Agricultural shows have always played an important role in my electorate of Braddon. For a few years now, the numbers attending some rural shows have been on the decline. The volunteers needed to run these shows have disappeared and the battle for some shows to remain relevant to a new generation has diminished. Tonight, however, I want to talk about a good-news story. Tonight I want to talk about a shining light in the agricultural show society. Tonight I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Burnie Agricultural and Pastoral Society and the work they've done to ensure that their show will be around for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 4 and 5 October the Burnie Show celebrated its 100th show. It is a remarkable and noteworthy achievement and I congratulate everyone who has played a part over the years on reaching such a milestone. But what's more important and more impressive is that their 100th show was their first show in their new location at the agriplex. Confronted with ongoing challenges and barriers at their old show location, the Burnie Show committee took a leap of faith and backed themselves in. Instead of being limited by a showground which was too small, where the sheds were full and there was no capacity to grow, they decided to sell their land to the Wivenhoe showgrounds and buy a 40-hectare site in Romaine near Burnie. This was a high-risk venture. But, as they say, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. And it has certainly been the case in this instance.

        The show was a success, with patrons flocking to the new showground in their thousands. More people visited the Burnie Show this year than the population of Burnie itself. What's more, the committee have money left over from the sale to build permanent structures on their land. This entrepreneurial committee is planning to build four permanent sheds to house animal and crafts exhibits and to build permanent toilets. And, as if that's not enough, they also have a long-term vision to build an Olympic sized equestrian stadium which can be used all year round. Not only will that be an amazing facility for the region; it will also provide ongoing cash flow for the organisation. The success of the Burnie Show demonstrates that all is not lost, and that there is a way forward for agricultural shows all over the nation. Yes, there might be some slight need for a change in focus, but it is possible.

        The ongoing viability of Australia's agricultural shows is important to the Morrison government. At a time when there is an increasing divide between the city and the bush, agricultural shows play a very important role in bridging that gap. As a farmer myself, I'm dismayed that many kids in the city don't know where their food comes from. In a recent national survey, it was found that one-third of Australian children struggled to identify fruit and vegetables. Ninety-two per cent didn't know that bananas grew on plants. Many of our kids think that cotton socks come from animals and yoghurt grows on trees. It's a disgrace. That's why our rural shows are important and that's why our government is delivering on an election commitment to boost agricultural shows and the advice that they provide. Eligible shows' societies could receive grants of up to $500,000 under the agricultural shows program. This is a $20 million investment that will reinvigorate showgrounds around the nation, help boost regional communities, increase local employment and drive people to purchase from our local businesses.

        Tonight I want to congratulate the Burnie Agricultural and Pastoral Society. I want to congratulate their president,

        , and the entire committee. I thank you tonight in this place for your great leadership and I look forward to catching up with you at an even bigger and brighter Burnie Show this time next year.
