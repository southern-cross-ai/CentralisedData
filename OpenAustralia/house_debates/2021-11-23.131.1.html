        I rise to talk about a couple of issues to do with members of the ADF who’ve served our nation and have not had the right thing done by them. I also want to acknowledge some firefighters. A couple of days ago, there was an opportunity in this chamber to talk about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        training. The debate finished before I had the opportunity to make a contribution. I would have said that our training in the ADF is top-notch. It is fantastic. But it doesn’t come without its dangers. Even with the risk management that goes on nowadays and even in the past, serious accidents happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to bring to the attention of the House a serious injury that happened to one of my soldiers who served in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle_Company_Butterworth" rel="nofollow">
         Rifle Company Butterworth
        </a>
        in Malaysia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Hayes
        </a>
        , Hayesy—a fantastic bloke—received a serious injury in 1994. Since 1994 Hayesy has been in a wheelchair. He had serious head injuries as well. He died a couple of times during the evacuation and was brought back to life. I have been working with his advocates to get him a gold card. He was seriously injured in the service of our country during training, and you would think that he would be well looked after. Unfortunately, for Hayesy, his accident occurred a couple of months after a change in legislation, which has meant that he hasn't been able to receive a gold card. It might be unbelievable to those listening that someone that suffered a serious back injury in 1994 that resulted in them not being able to use their legs cannot receive a gold card. What I've asked successive veterans' affairs ministers to do is to use their discretion because, as time goes on, there will be further complications, and Hayesy will need to be able to just go a medical professional to get the support that he needs. But, for whatever reason,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        and the minister haven't been able to make that occur. I appeal to the latest veterans' affairs minister in this government to use his discretion. If a gold card can't be given then a white card without conditions should be given. Hayesy has already got a white card, but it has all conditions on it. Hayesy is not going to the doctor to get unnecessary treatments. He goes for treatment that he needs as a result of his service.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has a Subaru with modifications to get around. He can drive it with his hands, and he's had that vehicle for over 20 years now. Subis are good vehicles and they do well, but his Subi is clapped out. He told me the other day that it's no longer safe to drive. I want to get Hayesy a new vehicle, so he's got mobility and he can get to his medical appointments. But DVA has been faffing around with this for over a year. The new person managing his case said, 'Oh, we'll look around and see what we can do.' Back when the accident happened and Hayesy needed a vehicle, Defence paid for it, rather than DVA. DVA said that they will pay for the modifications to the vehicle to allow it to be driven by hand. They won't pay for the vehicle, but they will pay for modifications. If his accident had happened three months earlier, they would have given him $39,810 towards a new vehicle. But because it happened three months after a change in legislation, he has to buy the vehicle. Mind you, he's still getting compensated the same amount he was getting when he was a young soldier, so it hasn't kept up with the career progression he would have had if it weren't for the accident. If anyone who owns a Subaru dealership is listening to this, he's after a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Outback" rel="nofollow">
         Subaru Outback
        </a>
        , which at the moment is $39,990. DVA will pay for the modification, but not for the vehicle, because he broke his back three months after a change in legislation, and ministers haven't been able to see their way clear to make a determination for this Australian soldier. The battle for Hayesy will continue, and I thank his advocates, Peter and Andrew.

        One of my constituents is a veteran firefighter,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Innes" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Innes
        </a>
        . He spent 18 years in the force, and a lot of firefighters get cancer. Andrew got leukaemia. He was fighting that and he was helped through workers compensation during that fight. But then it came to a point where they encourage people on workers compensation to return to the workforce. He worked really hard and probably didn't rest as much as he could have during chemo, which set him back a bit and he got another cancer in his throat. He is fighting that, and I am working with him and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        government who have done fantastic work bringing in compensation for these firefighters because they all get cancer. They don't all get cancer because of their workplace, but a lot of them do. We owe it to those who sign up to protect our country and our community. We owe them a bit better than that. We want to be doing everything that we possibly can when those who serve our country and our community are in the fight of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just wanted to send a message of solidarity to all those Australians who are in the fight against cancer. During COVID, people haven't been getting their tests as often as they should. Get your tests. Some cancers are linked to workplace issues, some are genetic, but get your tests. Let's make sure that, with our focus on COVID, we don't lose sight of the importance of getting all those tests, whether it be breast cancer screening or a bowel cancer test when you turn 50, which I did just the other day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to send that message of support to Drew, who's fighting cancer, and thank him for his work as a Territory firefighter. I also want to send a message of solidarity to my uncle, Ray Wellard, who is a former member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Fire_Brigade" rel="nofollow">
         Metropolitan Fire Brigade
        </a>
        in Melbourne. He's fighting cancer. My mum, Chris, was only visiting her beloved brother two weeks ago. Ray was frailer while battling cancer, she said, but he was walking and eating again, and the pain was under control. He's now settled into hospice care. So many Australian families have been through this journey. There can be a rapid dive when fighting cancer, and family members wonder whether there will be a final chance to say goodbye. So, if I can't, mate, I just want to say that you're a champion. You're a great bloke.
       </p>
       <p>
        My Uncle Ray has been resilient his whole life. When our mum's mum, nanna, had Ray in hospital, in Melbourne, the doctor said, 'Your son is not going to make it; he's not going to get out of this hospital,' such were the health challenges he had at birth. But he had so many surgeries. He served with the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. He lived for 76 years. He had two kids, Dana and Paul. He lived a great life. He was a great uncle. We did so many good things with you, mate—ferreting, spearfishing. We had a great life growing up with you, a great uncle. God bless you, mate. Go well, Ray, in this battle against cancer. We're all with you. Good on you, mate.
