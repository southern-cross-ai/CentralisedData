        by leave—I reluctantly move opposition amendments (1) and (2) together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 8 to 11), omit all the words from and including "require" to the end of subsection 22(1), substitute:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) require the relevant authority for the school or system to ensure that the school, or each school in the system, implements the national curriculum prescribed by the regulations in accordance with the regulations; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) provide such funding as is necessary to ensure that each teacher in the school or system has received professional development in the implementation of the national curriculum in accordance with a nationally consistent professional development program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 11), after subsection 22(1), insert:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1A) The national curriculum must not be prescribed unless the non-government school sector has had input into its development through membership and/or observer status on the

        I spoke to the two amendments to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 in my contribution in the House yesterday, so I will not delay the House further with a long dissertation about the amendments—although, if the minister insists on goading me, I might do so, which would be unwise because I am sure he has things he would like to get on with, as do I. Suffice to say, the first amendment deals with the provision of resources to the teaching profession in order to be able to implement a national curriculum and in order to get the training and the professional development that they seek in order to be able to implement a national curriculum. This is one of the great bugbears in this whole process of developing a national curriculum. This amendment is strongly supported by the sector, particularly by the teaching profession and all their unions, representatives and principals. I commend it to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second amendment, which is supported by the National Catholic Education Commission and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Schools_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Independent Schools Council
        </a>
        of Australia, will provide the necessary position for them to be observers or contributing members on the committee that is drafting the national curriculum. They both support it because they see it as important if the curriculum is going to be properly implemented in the non-government sector and also reflect some of the values and requirements of the non-government sector. I also commend that amendment to the House.
       </p>

        Question put:

       <p class="italic">
        That the amendments be agreed to.
