        My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister update the House on his decision to approve two coal seam gas projects in Queensland? What conditions have been imposed on the projects?

         I thank the member for Capricornia for the question. In 2008 there were a number of referrals for environmental approvals for projects led by Santos and QGC for coal seam gas projects in Queensland. Soon after receiving this portfolio, I travelled to Gladstone to inspect the sites and I also held meetings in Chinchilla with local government representatives and with some of the community groups that were opposed to the development. Last Friday I met the deadline that had been set for a decision under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">

         Act and approved the projects subject to a large number of conditions. For the Santos proposal there were more than 300 conditions, for QGC there were more than 300 conditions and for the dredging project there were 52 conditions. Those conditions make sure of the essential protections which we must make—we must protect the

           We are talking about areas which include endangered species such as the northern quoll, the water mouse, dugongs, and migratory species going through the area. That explains in part the large number of conditions. Most importantly, there are some very tough conditions on the use of water. I note that the member for Maranoa has taken a strong interest in this issue and has concerns about the use of water.
          </p>
          <p>
           The coal seams involve extraordinary quantities of water. A question came to light very strongly in information provided to me by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Geoscience Australia
           </a>
           as to whether or not the coal seams and the water contained within them were watertight. If they are watertight, then there is not a knock-on effect on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Artesian_Basin" rel="nofollow">
            Great Artesian Basin
           </a>
           ; if they are porous, then potentially there may be an impact on the Great Artesian Basin. It was recommended that I take a highly precautionary approach. That has been reflected in the conditions which have been imposed. For that reason there will be a scientific committee which will be involved in testing the actual thresholds and pressure levels—repressurisation may be required in instances; full reinjection may be required in some instances—to make sure that in enabling the jobs and the investment to go ahead in Queensland we do not at the same moment ignore the interests of our farmers or ignore the significance of the Great Artesian Basin.
          </p>
          <p>
           There have been a number of public comments, some positive and some negative, but I note the Maranoa Regional Council
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO

           , Stuart Randle, has said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We are satisfied that the risks on water quality are being properly managed and … they are actually taking water from completely separate water aquifers.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are a large number of conditions, and I think that is appropriate. In taking into account the environmental values of the area and the various risks, I believe the large number of conditions do get the balance right and will allow the investment to go ahead.
