        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and I refer again to this correspondence from Commissioner Cole which confirms that the Prime Minister’s terms of reference do not allow for findings in relation to ministers concerning the discharge of their duties. Will the Prime Minister now agree to end this cover-up by adding the following provision to Commissioner Cole’s letters patent—

         Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the opposition have had 10 questions today, but five of them have been the same. Again and again they have dressed up the same question in different words, and that is totally out of order and should be so ruled.

            <p>
             In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I think it would be a fairer interpretation of the letter written to his colleague—by not the commissioner, incidentally, but Mr Glenn Owbridge, the solicitor assisting the commission—to say that what the commission believes is that it would not be appropriate for a commissioner to seek amendment of the terms of reference to address a matter significantly different from that in the existing terms of reference.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the Leader of the Opposition wants is something that is significantly different and, quite frankly, the government is not going to accede to that request. The government set up an inquiry to determine whether there was any illegal behaviour. If that illegal behaviour has been engaged in by any of my colleagues or by me, if there is evidence of that, the terms of reference will be so amended. But we do not intend to go on frolics of the opposition in relation to this matter. The Leader of the Opposition might well expect that to be the government’s position. I think the stance taken by Mr Owbridge in relation to the request from the shadow minister for foreign affairs is entirely appropriate and entirely predictable, and in advance I can let the Leader of the Opposition know that he will have to establish a case for suspending standing orders with his entirely predictable censure motion.
