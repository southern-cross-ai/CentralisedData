        Prime Minister Turnbull's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout has become a multitechnology messy morass. Before the 2013 election the then opposition leader, the member for Warringah, a well-known socialist, and his then opposition communications spokesman, Mr Turnbull, gave an ironclad promise that by the end of 2016 all Australians would have an internet download speed of between 25 and 100 megabits per second. Sadly, not only has Prime Minister Turnbull broken that promise but his government's total mismanagement of the rollout has caused people in my electorate to become extremely angry and frustrated. My electorate office constantly fields phone calls and emails about NBN problems. I've held an NBN crisis mobile office in my electorate, where many people have told me their horror NBN stories. One of them, my angry constituent Matthew, from Runcorn, said that he's incredulous at the mess the Turnbull government rollout has become. Matthew says that within 400 metres of his premises there are three different technologies being used: upgraded

        </a>
        , fibre to the premises and fibre to the node. He says his service will be dramatically impeded after he's connected to the NBN. He says his service won't be able to perform anywhere near his existing service and he will have to rely on copper that is not currently adequate to provide a reliable

         ADSL
        </a>
        connection. Southside residents need a reliable and fast internet connection so that they can contact their families overseas, conduct businesses across Australia and the world or study. We need an internet service that we can rely on. The Turnbull government's NBN is in crisis, and they should be apologising to the Australian people for the mess they've created.
