        Every member in this place stands here as a community leader, and leadership casts a long shadow. What kinds of leaders do our communities expect us to be? Do they want serious, responsible people who respect the importance of the laws before us, or do they want larrikinsâ€”living, breathing caricatures like

        ? Improper behaviour before, during or after work, as anyone who has worked in the Public Service or the private sector well knows, can mean disciplinary action, and if it is part of a course of behaviour it may be a sackable offence. What we have witnessed over the last little while is embarrassing not just for the member and not just for his party; it's embarrassing for every member of this parliament, because we are examples to our community, young and old. We represent Australia to the international dignitaries and visitors we meet each week. How should we conduct ourselves so as to maintain their respect?
       </p>
       <p>
        We are under the spotlight and we should be acting accordingly. If we can't, then we must also be able to understand that there isn't a single member here who is irreplaceable. We come here, we make our contribution and we leave again. Our behaviour here matters; it matters at all levels. We need to help each other. We need to be hard on each other so that respect for this institution is maintained and upheld. Our constituents are watching. Our colleagues are watching. The world is watching.
