       <p>
        Today, I am excited to formally announce in the parliament a new initiative in my electorate: the inaugural Oxley electorate Spirit of Anzac Award. This will be a new competition open to students in year 11 across my electorate, who will be invited to submit a short essay, poem or piece of artwork on what the spirit of Anzac means to them. The recipient to be awarded first prize will receive flights and accommodation with a parent or carer to visit the

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that Anzac Day has a special place in the hearts of many Australians, as we pay our respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I am looking forward to receiving entries from students across the Oxley electorate as to what this special commemoration means to them, and I am pleased to advise the House that a selection committee, comprising representatives from local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        subbranches, will be convened to judge the most worthy recipient to be awarded first place as well as five other highly commended awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have some of the most dedicated and hardworking RSL subbranches in Oxley, who all do a tremendous job of representing our veterans. This initiative came as result of a round table I recently held with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Rishworth" rel="nofollow">
         Amanda Rishworth
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to work alongside my local RSLs, and I look forward to partnering with the branches as part of the Oxley electorate's Spirit of Anzac award. Today I would, in particular, like to acknowledge the outgoing president of one of the RSL subbranches, the Goodna RSL subbranch. I pay tribute to the work of Mrs Vivienne Stanbury, who recently stood down after 19 years continuous service in that roleâ€”and, I might add, the first woman in the Moreton district of the RSL to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate enough to attend the branch's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        last weekend where members showed their appreciation for all the hard work that Vivienne has done for almost two decades. In her final report to the committee Viv said her years in the role:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Have been filled with humour, camaraderie and achievements in the company of like-minded members, particularly those who volunteered to serve on the management committee. A generally thankless position where good decisions go unnoticed and unheralded.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also particularly acknowledge Maxine Norsgaard, the outgoing secretary of the subbranch.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this place today I would like to formally recognise and acknowledge the dedicated service by Viv for the countless hours of hard work that she has given to our local community over the past 19 years. Not only has Viv shown incredible support for veterans in our community; she has worked tirelessly alongside programs right across the whole of the south-west of Brisbane. I wish her well in her new role within the RSL, and I know that she will continue to serve our area for many years to come.
