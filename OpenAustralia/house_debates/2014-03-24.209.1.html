        First, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the multiskilling abilities you displayed earlier to get this chamber underway. So congratulations to you for doing that. On Saturday I attended the Australian Asian Association youth cricket tournament and tossed the coin for the fourth game being held that weekend. There were eight teams participating in the competition, which is held annually. They hope to grow this competition to probably having between 12 and 16 teams eventually. This was their third tournament, held on a typical Perth day with magnificent weather and blue, cloudless skies. The tournament was held by the Australian Asian Association at

        . I would like to congratulate young Yam Ko, the organiser of the day, who managed to get all those teams together on the day, and also Mr Rahim Ghauri, the president, who is often seen in my electorate at citizenship ceremonies announcing the names of candidates at particular ceremonies. I also managed to meet the Bangladeshi team, who were a fantastic, eager team. It was their first time competing in this tournament and they promised me they would perform to the best of their ability on the day. The tournament was also supported by the WA Department of Sport and Recreation, who did a fantastic job. Congratulations to all the teams that participated.
