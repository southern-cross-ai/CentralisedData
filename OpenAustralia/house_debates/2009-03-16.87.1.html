      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post - Wanneroo Post Office
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 26 November 2008 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee’s consideration regarding the relocation of the Wanneroo Post Office. I apologise for the delay in replying.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the location of postal outlets. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that it has a commercial lease on the property in Wanneroo Road, Wanneroo currently occupied by the post office and that it has no plans at this stage to relocate the outlet.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has further advised that, in consultation with the building’s owner, a refurbishment and upgrade is planned for completion this financial year. Australia Post has indicated that it believes that disabled access to the post office is currently adequate. However, Australia Post has undertaken to further assess the issue and, if changes to disabled access are required, the work will be undertaken as part of the proposed upgrade.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post believes that the outlet at its existing location is able to meet the needs of the community. However, Australia Post will continue to monitor the adequacy and convenience of the retail facility. Any decision in the future concerning a possible relocation of the outlet would need to take into account operational requirements and the options available at the time.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
