       <p>
        On Monday night, here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , we took Wollongong to the world, as the

         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        and I hosted the inaugural Illawarra Clean Energy Expo. Although this building is the home of Australian democracy, on Monday you could feel the power of the Illawarra in the room. The atmosphere was absolutely electric. Special thanks must go to the university for working with me to make this concept a reality. A very, very special thank you to the key organisers: Vice-Chancellor Professor Patricia Davidson; Director of the Energy Futures Network, Ty Christopher; Director of Government Relations, Canio Fierravanti, who is well known in the corridors of Parliament House; and Heidi De Coster and her husband, Greg, from Protocol at the University of Wollongong.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank and acknowledge the powerhouse of organisations that were present on Monday night. From

        We in the Illawarra are already changing our practices and reducing our emissions, introducing new technologies and activities to move quickly, efficiently and safely towards a clean energy future. The Australian government is investing in a range of projects with local partners, all meant to boost the Illawarra's preparedness for the changing energy future. Some of these include investing more than $1 million in a University of Wollongong study finding ways to keep Australia's grid secure; the Energy Future Skills Centre; the Renewable Energy Skills Training Centre at

        ; $9 million for Hysata; 400 community batteries across the country, including one in Warrawong; and we're one of the first six proposed sides for offshore wind energy. We've also got more than 900 additional places at the University of Wollongongâ€”an amazing contribution by the Albanese Labor government.
