        Today, I would like to congratulate the eight hockey players from my community who have been selected as part of Australian teams after representing

        players who pulled on the blue shirts to play in Hobart, four players were in the winning inaugural over-65s team, which was coach by Lismore hockey stalwart Wendy Trudgeon. The 14 selected to represent Australia next May in

        in the over-60s, and Jan Hutton—who can also play a mean tennis game—Chris Eather, Gloria McPherson, Janet Tancred and coach Wendy Trudgeon in the over-65s. I congratulate all these ladies on a great effort.

        I would like to commend the students of Kyogle High School, teacher Rebecca O'Meara and the whole community for the pride they have in their town. Kyogle has a history of winning Tidy Town awards. It also has a history of getting in there and having a go. The latest project is the brainchild of teacher Rebecca, who, with students from years 7 to 10, are painting many of the town's power poles with their own designs reflecting native flora and fauna of the Kyogle area. A supportive chamber of commerce and businesses like Kyogle Country Store have provided the students with paint and other materials, while the council organised approvals with Essential Energy. It has been an incredible effort, and I would like to congratulate the students: Nuttainee Sirising, Emily McCormick, Lilly Miles, Grace Endres, Ella Levis, Ayla Hausen, Alex Pryde, Oak Landers, Olivia Flower, Hayley Buttler, Taylor Wicks, Joshua Parkin, Summer Blake and Lilly Feakes.

        and Stratheden Street were the first to be adorned with the original artwork, which included a lomandra, an echidna, gum blossoms, a koala, wattles, a king parrot, a sandpaper fig and a bush turkey. I look forward to seeing the work soon.
