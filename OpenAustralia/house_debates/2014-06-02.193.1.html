        I rise to express my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lankan
        </a>
        national Leo Seemanpillai following his tragic death on Sunday morning. The grief experienced from the death of a loved one is difficult enough; the feelings of grief and despair are compounded when the loss occurs under tragic circumstances. Mr Seemanpillai had been in Australia on a bridging visa since arriving in Australia in 2013. He lived in Newtown in Geelong. He was working in the local community. Our government has been advised that Mr Seemanpillai was receiving mental health support. A case manager visited him on a regular basis. Last week he saw his caseworker once and they spoke again by phone. There was no indication of the dreadful events that were to follow.

        Mr Seemanpillai was an active member of St Paul's Lutheran Church in Grovedale, located in the Corangamite electorate, which I represent. I also extend my heartfelt sympathies to Pastor Tom Pietsch and his parishioners, who are in mourning. The

        community regarded Mr Seemanpillai as a man of strong faith who was very generous to others, particularly to the elderly members of the church. I am told that he often mowed peoples' lawns or did other kind deeds to assist his fellow parishioners. My thoughts are with Mr Seemanpillai's family and friends at this very sad time.
