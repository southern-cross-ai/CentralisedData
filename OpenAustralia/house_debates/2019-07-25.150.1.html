        Today I rise to congratulate two outstanding local community groups in my electorate on the

        </a>
        : the Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy on 34 years of support and fundraising and the Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary on 73 years of service. I particularly congratulate the seven members of the Toukley Torchbearers who were awarded life membership at their 34th Annual Friendship Luncheon. Life membership recognises over 10 years of service by Torchbearers and the awards were presented by the President of the New South Wales Torchbearers, Trish Berghaus. Congratulations to Alma Russell, Jean Aitken, Faye Robinson, Hazel Duckett, Lyn Whitby, Judy Ford and Roma Lawler on your service.

        Legacy cares for 60,000 people across Australia and almost 1,300 on the Central Coast, many of whom are elderly widows. There are some school aged children and, currently, nine university students supported by Legacy scholarships. Toukley Torchbearers currently has around 30 active members contributing to an annual fundraising effort of $25,000 to $30,000 each and every year. This year alone the Toukley Torchbearers has already organised at least two events each month, including at the Morisset and Gosford shows, the Scottish Spectacular and many market and street stalls. Activities planned for the remainder of the year include afternoon teas, cake stalls, golf days and the much anticipated annual fete. Their efforts help Legacy care for individuals and families living with significant loss and trauma. I offer the Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy my personal thanks on behalf of our grateful community. Thank you, President Judy Willmette, Secretary Ruth Condon, Treasurer Maz Cleary and all the members of Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy.

        I was also delighted to join members and friends of the Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary at their 73rd annual general meeting recently. The United Hospital Auxiliaries motto is, 'Let us hold high the lamp of service for the welfare of our hospitals.' Their objectives are threefold, and include assisting the welfare of patients and staff at all hospitals and healthcare centres within the state of New South Wales by providing all kinds of services and to assist in fundraising. The Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary more than lives up to this objective. Having worked at our local hospitals for almost 10 years I'm personally grateful for their efforts. The wisdom and warmth in the room was overwhelming, and it was a privilege to join so many local people who care and take care of our hospitals. The auxiliary has a longstanding tradition of presenting guests to its

        a box of locally-grown fruit and then sharing a homemade afternoon tea. Congratulations to 2019-20 President Toni Brewster and her executive team. The Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary has been running election-day stalls since 1946 and will continue to raise funds through raffles and coach trips. In the last financial year the auxiliary raised $9,600 for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , contributing funds for much-needed monitors for both the cardiac and medical wards. It was a privilege to be in the company of so many people with such deep roots in our community and who care for our hospital.
