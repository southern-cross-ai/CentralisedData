        I warmly welcome the residents of Springfield Central into the electorate of Blair. Springfield Central, which is south of Augusta Parkway and the Springfield Greenbank Arterial Road, has been added to the electorate of Blair. Founded in 1992, Springfield is Australia’s largest master plan city and community development project in single private ownership.

        The Greater Springfield area is the vision of

        and his business partner Bob Sharpless via their corporate vehicle, the Springfield Land Corporation. The ultimate objective is to create a city with a population of 105,000 people by 2031. Currently, over 20,000 people live in the Springfield area. Springfield is a vital part of the city of Ipswich, where I was born and have lived all my life.

        today. They are here to talk about further community infrastructure development for Springfield. The federal government is partnering with Springfield. The Springfield Town Centre Parklands has received a $10 million contribution from the federal government. This is an important initiative—important for the recreational and sporting lifestyles of the people of Springfield and Ipswich Central.

        Springfield is located in the western corridor, between south-west Brisbane and Ipswich Central. The economic development of Springfield is vital to the city of Ipswich. According to the
