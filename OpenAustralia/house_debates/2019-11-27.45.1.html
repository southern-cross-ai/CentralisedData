        I rise today regarding Jae, the son of my constituents Yuang and Tony Woodward. Jae came to Australia with his brother and mother as a young student and, whilst his mother and brother applied successfully for citizenship, Jay, unfortunately, didn't apply. This left him, after living here for 20 years, having to return to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        . He was advised that his visa was to expire and that there were no avenues to apply for a new visa. He promptly returned, breaking no laws. The department advised that he would have to return because there was a biological father in that country. Remember he has lived here for 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        He returned. He has begun to think about re-applying for entry after three years, as is the law. He abided by the decision and has been living in South Korea for over three years. He recently started to look for a pathway to be reunited with the only family he knows. There are no visas available for Jae, as his estranged father is assumed to still be alive, even though he's had no contact with him in over three years. The department advised my office that, even if Jae were eligible to apply as a sole remaining relative, this visa is not viable, as the current processing time is 50 years. I raise this in this House to ask this government to assist and reunite Jae with his loving mother, father and brother.
