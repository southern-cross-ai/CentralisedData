        I rise today to speak in support of Australian seafarers and a strong shipping fleet that supports our Australian seafarers, who do such great work. Our seafarers are some of the most highly-trained and highly-qualified seafarers in the world. That's the way we need to keep it, and that's the way I want to keep it and those on this side want to keep it. They're highly trained, they know our waters, they care for the environment and they navigate our waters with care for all of those things.

        In the western suburbs of Adelaide, we see many, many communities that were built upon strong manufacturing and shipping jobs since its establishment. As I said, many worked in manufacturing and shipping. Shipping jobs were always some of the most sought-after lifetime careers available. They were sought-after jobs. Sadly, this government has again walked away from some of these workers as we see flag-of-convenience ships crewed by some of the world's most exploited labour, which are replacing local workers. We've heard many horror stories about where labour hasn't been paid on some of the foreign ships that come in and a whole range of horrific things. Regularly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">

        intervenes to ensure the rights of those foreign workers.

        Let me say that this isn't about protectionism in a globalised market. This is about national security, energy security and local jobs that give back to the community. This is also about the protection of the environment from inexperienced crews from overseas. For example, the seat of Hindmarsh has some of the most pristine coastlines in the world. My border is the

        </a>
        with lots of industries—fishing, aquaculture and a whole range of other things—and some of the best beaches in the world. I've got to say: I don't trust some of the overseas operations that are exploiting inexperienced workers, potentially endangering not only my electorate but also seas, beaches and environmental-pristine areas all around Australia.
       </p>

        Why do we have to wait for a shipping disaster for this government to act? Why do we have to not act and not do anything? A recent Senate inquiry found that flag-of-convenience shipping poses serious security risks, while participants engage in large-scale tax avoidance and exploitation. This was in the last Senate inquiry around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOC" rel="nofollow">
         FOC
        </a>
        s, or flag-of-convenience ships. Australia has the fourth largest shipping task in the world, and Australian seafarers, as I said, are the most highly qualified in the world. This government should be cracking down on this and doing everything in their power to revitalise the Australian industry. I'd like to thank those constituents in my electorate for getting in touch with me regarding this important matter, and, as their local member, I will support them.
