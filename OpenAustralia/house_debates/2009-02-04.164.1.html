        I rise to acknowledge community volunteers; in particular, I acknowledge Judy Talbot from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_Junction" rel="nofollow">
         Brunswick Junction
        </a>
        in my electorate. Judy was awarded one of the highest national honours, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        , on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        for her outstanding lifetime services to the community. Judy is not only a tireless, passionate and dedicated contributor to Brunswick and the Harvey shire; she is also the first person ever from the little country town of Brunswick to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . I am sure that her family, her friends and the whole community are very proud and are still celebrating her achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are very few groups and organisations that Judy has not assisted at some time in her life. She has been a member and office bearer of the Brunswick
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        unit since 1965, and she has held the office of president since 1995. She has been president of the Leschenault region Red Cross, and she has worked as head steward of the widely respected flower section of the local show as a member of the Brunswick Agricultural Society. The Brunswick Show is widely recognised as the largest one-day show in Australia. Judy was also the society’s publicity officer for 20 years. She is a life member of the Koombana Bay Sailing Club. She has been the club commodore and was the publicity officer for 20 years and radio officer for 30 years. She is the publicity officer for the Brunswick Lions Club and was a volunteer for over 40 years before becoming an official member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy has also held the position of Secretary of the Brunswick-Burekup Anglican Ladies Guild. She is a member of the Brunswick Disaster Committee, a life member of the Brunswick Christian Primary School P&amp;C and has been secretary of the Brunswick self-help group since 1992. She is a committee member of the Harvey shire Meals on Wheels and secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Harvey
        </a>
        senior citizens bus committee. With all of this, it is not surprising that Judy has received the Red Cross service award, the rough tough gold medal of the WA Yachting Association and a Harvey shire meritorious service award.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principal" rel="nofollow">
         The Principal

        of the

         Harvey Senior High School
        </a>
        at the time Judy assisted their P&amp;C also commented to me that he doubted the school would have been able to fund and build their gymnasium without Judy’s dedication and strong support of the project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing Judy does is to encourage every community member. Local achievers all receive a lovely congratulatory note from her, and families who lose a loved one all receive a very genuine card or note from her. If you are in trouble, Judy is the first one to offer help. She is a wonderful example of the true spirit of small community volunteers in Australia. Congratulations to Judy.
