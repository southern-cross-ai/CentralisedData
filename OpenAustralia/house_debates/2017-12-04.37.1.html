       <p>
        On 24 November, I attended the 50th anniversary celebrations of St George Meals on Wheels. St George Meals on Wheels, of course, is located in Peakhurst, in the heart of my electorate, and has been doing an extraordinary job for decades now in looking after people in our community. The event was held at the Maso's club in Mortdale and I would like to thank President Ian Manley and all of the Maso's board for their constant support of community organisations like St George Meals on Wheels.
       </p>

        The service started back in 1967 and was originally operated in Depot Road at Peakhurst. But back in 2003, it moved to its current premises, co-located with what was called the Peakhurst Bowling Club but is now the Olds Park Sports Club. More than a million meals have been served in that time, and in the recent 12 months more than 50,000 meals were served to those in need. I'd like to thank President Leslie Sandiland; Vice President John Burke; secretaries Karen Bindon and

        ; and of course, the treasurer, Barbara Sainsbury.
       </p>
       <p>
        St George Meals on Wheels serves our region, stretching right up to the Rockdale region in the north, and for 50 years has been providing a wonderful service. May there be many more decades to come.
