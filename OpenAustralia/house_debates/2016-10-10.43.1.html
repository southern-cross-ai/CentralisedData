       <p>
        On Saturday, I had the pleasure of attending the 86th Waroona Agricultural Show and 33rd Karragullen Expo in Canning. Despite the weather, I was very pleased to see the local community engaged and supportive of the day's festivities. My congratulations go to the various winners of the hall exhibits at Waroona. I was able to present the prizes. I was particularly impressed with the work of Liz Hogan of Wedding Cake Boutique in Mandurah. For her efforts she took home the G&amp;R Sutton Trophy for Outstanding Exhibit in Decorated Cakes. There was a wide and impressive array of goods and produce on display. I would also like to congratulate Desmond Muir for taking out the Best New Horticultural Innovation Award at the Karragullen Expo for his AiroFresh technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the Waroona Agricultural Society for their work, in particular President Maree Ellis, Vice-President Eric Walmsley and Secretary Alison Birch. I also commend the Hills Orchard Improvement Group for their work at the Karragullen Expo, in particular President Bruno Del Simone and spokesperson Brett Del Simone. Between them they executed two very successful events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Waroona area suffered greatly from the bushfires in January this year, so it was inspiring to see the community come together in solidarity after experiencing such adversity. I am proud to be part of the thriving electorate of Canning that is working to pass on the best of its traditions to future generations. I look forward to the shows next year.
