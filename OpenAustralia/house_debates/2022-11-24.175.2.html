        THISTLETHWAITE (â€”) (): The date of 1 December each year is, of course, the first day of summer. It's also National Water Safety Day, and there's a clear connection between the two. Sadly, summer is the peak season when most drownings occur in Australia. We have already lost too many Australians to drowning over the past 12 months, and these are often deaths that can be prevented. While one drowning is still one too many, we must face up to the reality that it's been a particularly bad year, with 339 deaths, according to the latest national drowning report. As the weather warms up, more of us will be heading to the beaches, rivers and pools to cool off, but we should be celebrating the start of summer, not preparing for more sadness.

        I join with the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        , the member for Moncrieff, in encouraging all Australians to remember the importance of staying safe and acting responsibly around water across our nation over the summer. Accidents in the water can be avoided if we act responsibly and follow basic water safety rules. Always swim between the red and yellow flags at the beach and obey the instructions of lifesavers. Always supervise children in and around the water at all times. Avoid alcohol and drugs while undertaking water activities. Wear a lifejacket if you're going boating, rock fishing or on a watercraft. If you get stuck in a rip at the beach, don't panic; float and put your hand up; hopefully, someone will come and save you.
       </p>

        Our leading water safety authorities, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        and Royal Life Saving Australia, play an important role in helping to keep Australians safe in and around the water. The dedicated efforts of these organisations, including those of the lifeguards and lifesavers, as well as those of over 45,000 volunteers, contribute more than 1.3 million hours each year to make a vital and greatly valued contribution to our nation. Last season alone, surf lifesavers and lifeguards performed thousands of rescues and undertook more than a million preventive actions.

        I want to also acknowledge the importance of swimming lessons. Unfortunately, over the COVID period, we've seen a reduction in the number of kids undertaking swimming lessons, and this is something that we heard from SWIMSAFER ambassador

        this week, who's been calling for swimming lessons for six-month-olds through to 12-year-olds. These are skills for life. These are skills that can save lives, and I think governments at all levels need to be doing more to ensure that a kid that graduates from year 6 has gone through swimming lessons to ensure that they have basic competence in and around the water. Let's celebrate this summer and enjoy the great outdoors by being safe around the water.
