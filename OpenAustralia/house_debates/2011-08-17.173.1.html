       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I echo those comments. I rise today to highlight to the House how my state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        is being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economy through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . As Western Australia has grown and prospered, it has proudly contributed more and more to our federal economy. However, Western Australia has received less and less of the GST pool in return. In the last financial year, Western Australia received just 68 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue were distributed across Australia on an equal per capita basis. This is the lowest level of relativity applied to any state or territory since the GST was introduced some 12 years ago. In contrast, every other state and territory received not less than 91 per cent of what it would have received if the GST revenue were distributed evenly across Australia. The future outlook for Western Australia's GST revenue share is even more dire.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        Department of Treasury and Finance modelling indicates that by 2014-15 WA will receive just one-third of the GST it would be receiving if GST were distributed on a per capita basis. This would result in WA receiving $4 billion less than its equal per capita share.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I am prepared to see Western Australia continue to contribute to the GST distribution to other states and territories, there has to be some limit to this rip-off. As such, I have tabled a motion in this parliament that proposes the introduction of a reasonable 75 per cent floor in GST relativities. A 75 per cent floor would preserve the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation and would preserve the formula used by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Grants_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Grants Commission
        </a>
        without unfairly penalising any state for its disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity. This GST is forecast to add $1.8 billion to WA's GST grant in 2013-14 and an estimated $2.5 billion the following year. To put this in perspective, the savings in 2014-15 alone would be enough to fund our state's biggest public country hospital development, the Albany Health Campus, 14 times over.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an elected representative of the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        , it is my duty to stand up for the rights of my constituents, and I intend to do this by spearheading the move to reverse the GST rip-off for Western Australia. The leader of the WA Nationals, the Hon. Brendon Grylls
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        , and the WA Premier, the Hon. Colin Barnett MLA, have already indicated their support for establishing a floor on the GST relativities. The opposition leader in Western Australia, the Hon. Eric Ripper MLA, also expressed his concerns relating to the GST distribution. I call on all Western Australian members of this place to properly represent their constituents and their state by supporting the reform to the GST distribution.
