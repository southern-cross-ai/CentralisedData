        Last Friday, I held a morning tea with the popular Prime Minister. It was attended by representatives of a broad range of community groups, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        s, Meals on Wheels, Rotary, Lions, church groups and Probus clubs to name but a few. The morning tea was extremely well represented by leaders from multicultural groups and businesses from Adelaide's Chinese, Indian, Korean, Greek, Italian, Singaporean and Taiwanese communities. I enjoyed speaking with many who attended, and I was impressed to hear the story of Mr Yong Koh, a Singaporean migrant who is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of First Class Australasia, exporters of fresh Australian lobsters and abalone to China and Japan. Mr Koh is no doubt optimistic about the opportunities thanks to the government's free trade agreements.

        , from the Glenelg Historical Society, wrote to me saying she 'was impressed by the representation of the multicultural and many-faceted community groups that make up the Hindmarsh community' and by the Prime Minister's genuine interest in the community groups represented.
       </p>
       <p>
        The morning tea also took the form of a

        While the Prime Minister was in my electorate, I joined him in a meeting with Mr Jin Liang, chairman of Datong Australia, a high-quality international developer in property, located in Adelaide. It was pleasing to hear of Datong's investment in
