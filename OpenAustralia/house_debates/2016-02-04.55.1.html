        I have spoken previously about the federal government's continuous-build strategy for naval vessels and the need for my home state of

        to make sure our students are well positioned to take advantage of the job opportunities that this offers. As we head into a new year, I believe it is important to do so again. I would also like to thank Jordan McKay from the

        , who recently wrote a report for me on the education pathways required, as part of his parliamentary internship in my office.

        In a nutshell, if South Australia is to seize the jobs and economic impact associated with naval shipbuilding, we need to ensure that there are strong pathways for our young people to get the skills, education and training they need to move into the industry. In particular, while local universities do have a number of degrees with a naval focus, these are decades-long projects. Our focus must be on secondary-school foundation skills to give us a strong pool to build and maintain this workforce over the long term.

        There are currently a number of good initiatives within my state in this area. With the Maritime High School of South Australia at Le Fevre, as well as the Advanced Technology Schools Pathways Program, we have 20 high schools that incorporate a focus on high-level

        skills and potential pathways into the Defence industry, including

        in my electorate. But it is vital that we capitalise on these sorts of initiatives. The state government needs to take a serious look at the skilling of our Defence industry workforce.
