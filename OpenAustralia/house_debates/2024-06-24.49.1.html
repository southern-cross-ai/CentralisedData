       <p>
        Last week was full of events across the Flynn electorate, with the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AG" rel="nofollow">
         AG
        </a>
        -Grow and Mount Larcom Show on. At this year's AG-Grow in Emerald there were around 1,500 companies on display, and 28,000 visitors were expected to pass through the gates. AG-Grow is always a chance to catch up with old mates, but it's also an opportunity to meet with agricultural suppliers and to keep up with the latest innovations in the industry. It is also a social event that not only highlights but recognises and celebrates our hardworking rural and regional way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday I had a terrific day at the Mount Larcom Show. From wood chopping, horses and animal nurseries to family fun, there's always something for everyone. I was pleased to attend the official opening, where I was able to thank all the volunteers and exhibitors that make the annual event so memorable. I would also like to make special mention of 97-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Peters" rel="nofollow">
         Jean Peters
        </a>
        , who has been part of the success of the Mount Larcom Show for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without volunteers, many of these events across rural and regional Australia simply don't happen. So, if you have spare time and would like to give back to your community, I encourage you to put your hand up and become a volunteer at all local events.
