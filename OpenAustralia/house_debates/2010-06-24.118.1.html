       <p>
        by leave—I wish to spend a short time giving the tabling statement that accompanied the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration that was tabled in the House earlier in the week. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, who is at the table, for his indulgence. I refer to the committee’s report in connection with its visit late last year to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . This was a unique visit, the first of its kind. The committee welcomed the opportunity to represent the Australian parliament in its participation in the 2009 New Zealand committee exchange program. The committee undertook its visit to New Zealand in the context of gaining a better understanding of how New Zealand administers its external territories of Tukulu in the Pacific and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Dependency" rel="nofollow">
         Ross Dependency
        </a>
        in Antarctica. In addition, in line with the advisory role on the national capital, the committee was interested to compare the way in which urban design is applied to the capital of New Zealand—namely, Wellington. The committee also renewed its parliament-to-parliament ties.
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to New Zealand’s external territory in the Pacific, the committee was able to gain insight into complexities by ensuring adequate service delivery and gain an appreciation of the challenges that may be encountered in seeking to improve the economic development of a small and relatively isolated economy. In addition, the committee was fortunate to be given the opportunity to meet with New Zealand’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Select Committee
        </a>
        on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and to discuss ongoing inquiries which are of mutual benefit. At the time of the committee’s visit to New Zealand, it was inquiring into the changing economic environment in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        territories of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_Keeling_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Cocos Keeling Islands
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The visit greatly enhanced the committee’s understanding of the types of economic and social challenges which may be encountered through its inquiry and also provided it with the opportunity to relay Australia’s experience in its administration of external territories. In a broader context, the committee gained a greater appreciation of the joint role of Australia and New Zealand in the Pacific through its meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Murray McCully MP and officials of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        . The committee was also appreciative of the opportunity to meet the Hon. Chris Carter MP, shadow spokesman on foreign affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank a range of groups, departments and individuals in New Zealand who participated in the visits, meetings and activities. The support and enthusiasm of all involved ensured that the visit was productive and memorable. I commend this report to the House.
