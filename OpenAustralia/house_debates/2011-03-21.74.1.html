        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her press conference on 24 February where she committed the government to a ‘full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme’. Is the Prime Minister aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        has stated that a cap-and-trade scheme will cause electricity prices to ‘skyrocket’? Why is the Prime Minister’s promise of compensation for skyrocketing electricity prices any more believable than her promise that there would be no carbon tax under any government she leads?

         that she is referring to. I do not think it was yesterday; I think it was the Sunday before that that went to air. We are seeing the usual degree of research and endeavour by the opposition we have come to expect because of their lazy approach to politics and their lazy approach to policy.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in answer to the question she asked me that yes, she is absolutely right. I did say before the last election campaign I wanted a full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme, and we will get a full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for verifying that to the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         In referring to the segment with President Obama, No. 1, I think she would note that it was some time ago and, No. 2, she would note that President Obama has committed his nation to a clean energy future. President Obama is in a situation where, with the Congress the American people have elected, he is not in a position to legislate an emissions trading scheme.

           The member for Goldstein says, why would we have one? The reality is—and let me explain this to the member for Goldstein—I am someone who shows a great deal of admiration for the United States of America. I think that was on display when I recently travelled there, but the member for Goldstein may not realise we are not little Americans; we make decisions for our own country.

             <p>
              Every economist of any repute is telling us that the least costly way of dealing with carbon pollution is via pricing carbon. So why, as Prime Minister, would I deny this nation the most efficient, least-cost way of dealing with carbon pollution because
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
               President Obama
              </a>
              has made a different decision? Why would I do that? Of course I would not. This nation deserves to have the least-cost way of dealing with carbon pollution, and that is pricing carbon. That is exactly what we will do, initially through a fixed-price—effectively like a tax—then moving to an emissions trading scheme, as I have outlined on behalf of the government and as I have outlined on behalf of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other side, what do we see as the alternative? What we see, of course, is them taking $30 billion out of the purses and wallets of Australians and giving it to big polluters. On this side, we will take money from big polluters and give it through generous assistance to households.

                 Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was indicating, the division here is whether you want to put a price on polluters and give assistance to households or whether you want to take money off households and give assistance to polluters. We will put a price on pollution. That price will be paid by polluters. We will generously assist households for the price impacts that they will experience. I have been very upfront about that. What the opposition wants to do is take money off Australian households and give it to big polluters. The opposition should come clean about that. Their price tag for Australians is $720 straight off them, straight out of their purses, straight out of their wallets and straight to a polluter.

                    Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to reconsider that action, given that all that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was seeking to do was table a CD, which is like any other document in modern parliaments.

                     of Opposition Business will resume his place. It would assist in future if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition comes straight to that she is seeking leave to table a document. I take the point that the Manager of Opposition Business has made—that the electronic version is permissible as something that can be tabled—but I ask that in future the person approaching the dispatch box for the purpose of tabling a document indicate that straight up. Otherwise, on a testy day such as the one so far, you will understand that the chair will assume that things are not as they appear. Having said that, I withdraw the standing order 94(a) ruling, but I inform people that there is a general warning.
