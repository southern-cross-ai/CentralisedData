        The voices of young people in our community are often overlooked in this place, and that's why I'm participating in Raise our Voice Australia's

         COP
        </a>
        26 summit in Glasgow, he has a message for us all in this place. Sam is a public-speaking champion, so I hope I can do him proud in this chamber. This is Sam's speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Our wonderful unique wildlife is dying. You know it's true; you've seen countless statistics roll in, heard hundreds of people speak about the matter, and yet our actions to prevent climate change have been limitedâ€”held back by people determined to go against the opposing group, no matter what its policy is. My vision is that in 20 years time when I commute to work I won't feel guilty. I will be reassured in the knowledge that the transport I am using isn't affecting the environment around me. In 20 years time, it shouldn't matter who's in which party or who believes in what; decisions should be made for the best of the planet instead of just for personal gain. Twenty years into the future I want to see active, wide-scale efforts to clean up our planet, to reduce and eliminate any further damage from happening. We will be saving species, not losing them. The consequences of your actions and your decisions will be burdened on the youth of this country and the youth of tomorrow. Make your choices wisely, as changes made now could cause irreversible damage'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, Sam. I hope to take your message forward in the Australian parliament.
