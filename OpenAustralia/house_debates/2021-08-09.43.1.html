        I rise today to speak about the Bayside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Roundtable I recently convened in my electorate of Bonner. I believe there is a great need for increased mental health services, particularly on the bayside of Bonner and especially during this unprecedented pandemic. To understand the thoughts of the Bayside, I encouraged the community to take part in my mental health survey. Over 500 responses were collected in just two weeks. It was a truly overwhelming response. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents believe that there is a real need for more services in our community. With a clear need for more support, I want to ensure the Morrison government's $2.3 billion investment into mental health sector services delivers on the Bayside.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a next step I organised the Bayside Mental Health Roundtable. I involved mental health experts from the Bayside who have a deep understanding of the needs of our community to workshop solutions with me. I was joined by a range of community providers, including but not limited to service providers,

        </a>
        s, first responders, schools and more. Learning about life-changing work our mental health experts are already doing in our community was a privilege, along with how all levels of government can work together to better support them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue pursuing the outcomes of the Bayside Mental Health Roundtable and fighting for the funding for my community. I extend my sincere thanks to all those who took part in the roundtable. These conversations are just the beginning.
