        As International Women's Day approaches, I'm delighted to be shining a light on the remarkable accomplishments of the Durack female leaders that I've had the pleasure of working with and collaborating with as the federal member for Durack. In the next few weeks on my social media, I'll be sharing captivating narratives, valuable insights and also the unique challenges faced by over a dozen extraordinary women who are residing in our remote, regional and rural communities.

When we asked her who her role models were that inspired her, she said: 'My mother, who passed away at a young age from illness. She was selfless and gave everything to her family. Coming from an
