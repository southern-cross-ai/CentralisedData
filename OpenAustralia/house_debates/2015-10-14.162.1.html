        It is a pleasure to rise and give the House an update on things that are happening in the spectacular electorate of Dunkley. It is the Riviera of Melbourne. The place runs through my veins, and I am pleased that so much is happening, because it is such a dynamic and diverse community.

        At last, the Frankston War Memorial project is getting off the ground. I was pleased to make an election commitment of funding toward that project and to partner with many local people to see the current location—where commemorative services effectively clog up one of the main arterial roads in our city—relocated to Beauty Park, which can cope with the thousands and thousands of local residents that participate in annual commemorative services. We were hoping to have this ready and up and going for the Centenary of the Anzac landings, but some discussions over the precise siting and how to fund it saw that not achieved. What was also in my mind is that this year is also very significant for the Vietnam veterans community. As patron of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia for our region, the guys and their families remind me regularly that this is the 50th anniversary of our engagement in Vietnam. Some very significant battles, such as the battle of Balmoral and Coral, are part of that. We were hopeful of having all of that brought together in a commemoration at the new war memorial site.

        The council has finally settled on a game plan, and I want to particularly acknowledge Councillor Darrel Taylor. He has been in the vanguard of this project from the very beginning. From the initial community forum where he and I both spoke with great passion urging community members to get behind the project, he has been there, and his family have been very much involved.

        , his delightful wife, has been out there doing fundraiser as well. As mayor and now as a councillor, Councillor Taylor has continued outstanding work and we are finally going to see some progress on that project.

        'At last' is another term I use for the

        signage project. Members in this House, and certainly the local community, would know of my longstanding campaign to get the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Bypass" rel="nofollow">

        constructed. Funding commitment from the then Howard government was really a time that focused people's minds on the importance of this project. It has been completed and is now known as the Peninsula Link. The economic and community benefits are substantial, but you need to be a clairvoyant to find which exit to use to go to particular population centres or local attractions. The asset runs right through the community of Baxter, yet nowhere on those exits is the Baxter community respected and recognised with proper signage. Key regional tourism destinations are invisible to the thousands of motorists that are using this magnificent piece of infrastructure.

        I was able to secure funding, through another election commitment, to get that signage fixed. Some people wondered why the feds were involved. Well, for regional economic benefits someone had to step up, solve this problem and bring the parties together. Negotiating with multiple road authorities is an absolute delight, and I can commend it to you all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am looking forward to further updates for the Dunkley community. There is a lot happening and a lot to report on. I will take another opportunity to provide further information.
