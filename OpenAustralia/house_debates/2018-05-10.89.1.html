       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why was the Prime Minister willing to separately legislate different stages of the government's corporate tax cuts but unwilling to do the same for tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners? Why is it always one rule for big business and another for low- and middle-income earners? Isn't the Prime Minister the only person standing in the way of tax cuts for ordinary Australians from 1 July?

         Before I ask the Treasurer to complete this answer, I just say that the honourable member who just asked the question is not the only person standing in the way of tax cuts for hardworking Australians; it's the entire parliamentary Labor Party.

          We put the whole Enterprise Tax Plan to this parliament. We put that in this House of Representatives, and it was passed by this House. We've done exactly the same thing here. And I say to the member—

          An honourable member: Will they give leave?
         </p>
         <p>
          that, if they give leave, we'll be happy to debate this bill right now. Why don't you give us leave? We'll pass it now—the whole thing. Come on! Let's have the debate! Let's pass the bill! Shall I seek leave, Mr Speaker, to bring on that motion of business? We'll have that opportunity very shortly, if they so desire. We gave them that opportunity the other day, and the shadow Treasurer scurried under the table there, like the little rat he is. He got under there—

            I withdraw. I withdraw—I would hate to offend the sensibilities of the member for McMahon! We know what a precious flower he is! We know what a petal he is! But, when it comes to this issue, I have a question for the Labor Party—and I know the answer, so it's rhetorical. They do not want to act on bracket creep in this country. That's what they're saying. They've been shifty all week on this—as shifty as the Leader of the Opposition. They're hedging their bets; they're saying, 'We'll support this; maybe we'll support that.' The Australian people just want a straight answer from the Labor Party: 'Do you support lower taxes for all Australians'—a simple question—'or are you going to be stuck in your rut of envy and bitterness and want to punish Australians who are just working hard and seeking to get on?' The Labor Party, when it comes to tax, are rolled-gold failures—absolute rolled-gold failures. And they're led by a rolled-gold failure.
