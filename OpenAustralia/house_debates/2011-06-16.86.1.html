        I rise to speak on an issue of great concern to some residents of my electorate. Nasser Sedghi is a well-respected businessman in Dubbo. His brother Farhad was arrested several weeks ago in Tehran by the authorities. He is being held in prison in Tehran and no charges have been laid. Farhad Sedghi is an academic and a member of the Baha'i faith.

        are pacifists and in Iran they are being denied access to education. Farhad Sedghi was working delivering educational opportunities to the Baha'is through an online university in Tehran and has been arrested and held without any charge. Farhad is 64 years old. His family had no contact with him and they are concerned about his wellbeing. He is not in good health.

        I would like to acknowledge the office of Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, with whom I have been in contact and whom I visited yesterday. They pointed out that the situation would be difficult enough if Farhad Sedghi were an Australian citizen but it is nearly impossible when he is an Iranian citizen. In this day and age, it is a very sad state of affairs when someone of a gentle faith whose only supposed crime was to try and deliver education to his fellow man—a respected citizen and a man with an impeccable record and very high standing within the Tehran community—could be arrested at this stage of his life and held without charge for an indefinite period. I believe the foreign minister will do everything possible in diplomatic circles to help Farhad Sedghi. I certainly hope that is possible, because his brother and family in Australia are terribly concerned about his welfare.
