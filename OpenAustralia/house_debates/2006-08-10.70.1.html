        I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. On Tuesday morning, I am not sure what time but certainly around 9 or 10, two very fine women arrived here at the parliament after having spent some time walking across the Nullarbor to draw attention to the need to eliminate racism in our community—a very low-key affair, done without much fanfare, but of interest to the media. When they came into the parliament—with the approval of another member, not me—I must say they were treated with a lack of respect by the building staff and asked to remove the aprons that they had worn during that walk. The information on the aprons was very simple. ‘Steps toward healing’ is what it said on the front or the back, with a map of Australia, half black and half white, and hands reaching up to each other in relief, in reverse colour. They were required to remove that clothing before coming into the parliament and, although they did not complain greatly to me, it was clear that they were treated in ways that can only be described as officious and unpleasant. I wonder if you would investigate that matter, please.

         I thank the member for Fremantle. As the member for Fremantle would be aware, the staff at the doors do operate under guidelines concerning statements, but I will certainly make further investigations on her behalf.
