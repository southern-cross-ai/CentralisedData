       <p>
        With summer fast approaching I rise to draw to the attention of the House a proposal of Holroyd Council, which covers parts of my electorate, to build a new swimming pool on the outskirts of Greystanes, which will be funded by closing three existing pools, including Wentworthville Pool.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few weeks many residents have contacted my office to complain about that councilâ€™s plan to close Wentworthville Pool. I share these concerns and I am taking up the fight to reverse this terrible action. Wentworthville Pool is a great place to spend the summer months. It would be a terrible shame to lose such a great community facility. As a former councillor and

        , I am astounded by the short-sightedness of Holroyd Council. Many residents use the pool on a daily basis during summer. They are outraged at the prospect of losing their pool. They rightly feel that a pool on the outskirts of Greystanes is too far out of the way. Residents in

        , Toongabbie and Girraween will be terribly disadvantaged.
       </p>
       <p>
        One swimming centre to replace three would also cause problems for booking times for schools that need to use the pool and hold learn-to-swim classes for our young people, who will now be competing for resources at the busiest times of the year. With the support of Wentworth Leagues Club president, Peter Bain, and Holroyd city councillor Vasee Rajadurai, I have launched a petition to keep Wentworthville Pool open. Residents in my electorate who use the pool can be assured I will work with them and fight keep our local pool open.
