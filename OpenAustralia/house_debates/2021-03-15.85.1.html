        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister please advise the House on the Morrison government's commitment to reducing family and domestic violence, including through the new Stop it at the Start campaign?

           I start by recognising every woman in every town gathered around Australia demanding change. Whether it's on the lawns of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament House
           </a>
           , in my own home town of Albury, at the school gate, at the water cooler or the traditional owners caring for country, this parliament has heard them. Their voices have been heard. Change is happening, and the Morrison government is helping to drive that change here in our workplace where we must lead by example. People have every right to feel safe and supported in their workplace, and, just as importantly, they have every right to feel safe in their own home where there is never an excuse for family or domestic violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Last year the Morrison government delivered a $150 million domestic violence response package to respond to the changing needs through COVID in addition to our $340 million record investment in the fourth national action plan, and we're developing the next national plan because we're not standing in one place; we're getting on with what we know we need to do. We're consulting carefully about that plan, due in 2022. We know that early intervention is key for a future where Australians can feel safe in their own home, in their communities and online, and in which Australian men grow up respecting the women in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           To mark
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
            International Women's Day
           </a>
           last Monday, Ministers Payne and Ruston in the other place launched the third phase of our national primary prevention campaign to reduce violence against women and their children. It's called Stop it at the Start. The campaign is now rolling out across television, cinema, online, outdoor digital and social media. It's getting a very good response. The part that is often mentioned to me is where fathers are standing watching their sons play football and one says, 'Stop playing like a girl,' which is something that as I grew up would have probably been quite a normal thing to say at the sidelines of a footy match but certainly isn't now. It's questioning that. It's having those conversations. This campaign is a central part of that. It challenges disrespectful attitudes and behaviours, which can often be learnt in childhood and, if left unchecked, can escalate to violence. It encourages adults to unmute themselves and empowers them to take actions that will have a positive influence on the attitudes and behaviour of young people.
          </p>
          <p>
           Taking action can seem to be overwhelming, but, if we all take small steps such as talking to our children about respectful relationships, it will add up to positive change for Australia. I encourage everyone to have a look at the suite of resources on respect.gov.au and remind people of the independent review that is happening in this parliament now—the change that I said is happening—and the dedicated number, 1800APHSPT, for independent, anonymous and confidential help.
