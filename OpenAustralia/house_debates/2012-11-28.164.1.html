        of Australia Award 2012. This is a very prestigious award, and I would like to congratulate them sincerely.

        Australian Navy Cadets, as with other ADF cadet programs, offer important opportunities for young people in our community. The ADF Cadets provide a great opportunity to enhance the skills of our young people which in term benefits the nation. TS
        <i>
         Noarlunga
        </i>
        Navy cadet unit, as with other cadet units across the country, provides young Australians aged between 12½ and 19 years to gain a unique military and leadership experience. Navy cadets foster values of honour, honesty, integrity, courage, loyalty, teamwork and citizenship. The Australian Navy Cadets program develops an individual's abilities, confidence and capacity to contribute to Australian society. From that, we all benefit. Navy cadets contribute their time to local, state and national events, giving back to our community. I have seen this firsthand, delivered by a number of the TS
        <i>
         Noarlunga
        </i>
        cadets around many, many different organisations and places. For example, at local citizenship ceremonies on a Monday or Tuesday night, they are out there working to welcome new citizens into our community by providing help.
       </p>
       <p>
        ADF cadets also provide a pathway into serving in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        as a career. The training for Navy cadets, for example, includes seamanship, boat handling, sail and power, navigation, physical training, rifle shooting, signalling, rope splicing, general sporting activities and a variety of other subjects. This training is very exciting for young people to experience. Additionally, instructional camps are arranged for cadets and they are often given opportunities wherever possible to undertake training at sea in ships of the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year these Navy cadet units are judged around the country. As I said previously, I was immensely proud that this year TS
        <i>
         Noarlunga
        </i>
        after all the rounds and drills, inspections and assessments—won the 'Most Efficient Training Ship'

         Navy League of Australia
        </a>
        award. This award, by the Navy League of Australia, is given to the best naval cadet unit in the country. It recognises excellence in teamwork, leadership, ceremonial standard, emergency response procedures, dress and bearing, ability in maritime activities and community support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased to be joined by Parliamentary Secretary David Feeney and the

        to share with the local Navy cadets the formal recognition of their achievement. They beat 87 other cadet units from around Australia. So, congratulations go to the 23 cadets who are currently part of TS
        <i>
         Noarlunga
        </i>
        . Also, congratulations to the great team of staff and volunteers who worked very hard to prepare and support the cadets for this day, and I thank them for their dedication and hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to congratulate the staff of the unit led by Lieutenant David Lyas and all the support committee of dedicated volunteers headed up by the president, Kerry White. The most recent achievement builds on their very successful history at TS
        <i>
         Noarlunga
        </i>
        . The unit was recognised by the Royal Australian Navy in 1982 and was later selected 'most efficient unit' in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        in 1987, 1988 and 1991, and 'most improved' in 2001. In 2004 Cadet Midshipman Mark Weeden was judged top cadet.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was wonderful to have the vice admiral there because his father, Lieutenant Commander Jim Griggs, headed up the unit in 1991. Mrs Maureen Griggs, his wife, is still an avid supporter of the unit, so it was wonderful to have their son there as Chief of Navy to share in this special occasion. Thank you to all the cadets and their mentors for helping out the local community. I offer my sincere congratulations.
