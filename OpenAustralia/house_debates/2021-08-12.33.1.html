       <p>
        Since the Morrison government came to office, there are 3,000 fewer people studying to become aged and disability carers. The knock-on effect is not enough workers on the floor of our aged-care or disability-care centres and fewer people to attend in their homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm going to read to you a letter I received from a woman in my electorate named Josephine. Josephine is 86 years old and a resident at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        LifeCare in Merimbula. She said: 'The carers here are wonderful people dedicated to their work. However, I am aware the Morrison government hasn't raised the carers' wages since the royal commission into aged care, as promised. I'm writing to protest the status quo. I was a trained nurse at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vincent's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        in Sydney and my husband was a heart transplant surgeon. I know how concerned he would be at this present situation. I hope other people are as concerned about this as I am. Carers and nurses are valuable members of our community and the least valued.' Josephine is right. Aged-care workers are invaluable. Aged-care workers have been at the front line of this pandemic, looking after our loved ones, who are some of the most vulnerable. But the Prime Minister doesn't value aged-care workers, because, if he did, they would still be some of the worst paid workers in this country.
       </p>

        This should have been a recommendation moved on quickly by this government. I'm not surprised that there are less than half the enrolments in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        to study health and welfare and aged and disability caring today than there were in 2013. This is what happens when a government doesn't value their industry.
