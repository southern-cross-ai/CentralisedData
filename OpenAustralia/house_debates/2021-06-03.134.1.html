           <p>
            This is a bill that was half-baked when it was announced, it was half-baked when it went through their party room and it was half-baked when it entered this parliament today. Let me just go through some of the issues. A bill that was supposed to have the effect of reducing the fees that members paid on their superannuation account, because of their incompetence, actually did the opposite! They had to be browbeaten into including administration fees to the benchmarks. A bill that was supposed to strengthen superannuation and their investments did the opposite, because it actually created a disincentive for Australian workers' money to be invested in Australian infrastructure and Australian agricultural investments. They had to be browbeaten into changing this. We thought after two embarrassing backflips they would've got the message and listened to the sensible suggestions that were being made by Labor. This bill, in the form that it was brought into the House, was so bad that even members on their backbench weren't going to vote for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the royal commission. We weren't surprised that a government that voted against this royal commission document 27 times wasn't going to implement all of its recommendations, but this is
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital" rel="nofollow">
              Das Kapital
             </a>
            </i>
            . We were absolutely flabbergasted that a government that calls themselves conservatives and liberals would introduce a bill with a power that is more inspired by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" rel="nofollow">
             Karl Marx
            </a>
            than Ken Hayne. But that's exactly what they've done, and that's why we are here today—because they have introduced a bill into the House more inspired by Karl Marx and more befitting of Soviet-era Russia than modern Australia. Never again will the Treasurer be able to lecture Labor on economic responsibility. We will remind Australians that the Treasurer and the government that can't balance their own budget wants to take over the savings of ordinary Australians. We will remind them every day until the next election.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to congratulate those members of the government backbench who, having originally voted for it when it went through their party room, woke up to the enormous threat that it presents to Australians and their savings. They have raised their concerns with me, with members of the Labor opposition, with members of the crossbench and eventually with members of the government. I want to congratulate those members of the backbench of the coalition parties for doing the right thing. Many of them have raised their concerns in this place, and I want to congratulate them for doing the right thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            As bad as the directions power is, it is not the only problem with this bill. Labor wants to foreshadow that we have a range of amendments. If this amendment fails, we have an amendment which covers the field. We have a range of other amendments that we propose to move in the House today. I'll go through the issues that they cover off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly, this government has said the purpose of this bill is to ensure that members have funds that are performing for them, and, to give effect to that, they want to introduce a performance measure so that we can weed out the underperforming funds. Members of this House, Labor wholly supports that objective. We want to see that happen. But why on earth would a government that says that what it wants to do is weed out underperforming funds introduce a bill in the House which actually staples members to underperforming funds? There aren't a small number of them. According to the Treasury, three million Australians are going to be stapled to underperforming funds because of the legislation that you are foreshadowing that you will vote for. So, we encourage you to contemplate that fact. Are you going to be on the side of the three million Australians who, if you let this bill through, are going to be stapled to an underperforming fund, or are you going to support this sensible amendment?
           </p>
           <p>
            I call on the crossbench to contemplate that fact. You were so confident in the advice that you were given by the government and by the Treasurer that they had this bill right. You were so confident the government had this right. I say the same thing to members on the coalition backbench as well. A couple of weeks ago the government said they had this bill right—

             <p>
              Thank you, Deputy Speaker. A few weeks ago the Treasurer stood in your party room and said, 'This bill is ready to go.' But today they have been forced into an embarrassing admission that the bill was anything but ready to go. How can you have faith in what they are telling you now, when it has been pointed out to you that three million Australians are about to be stapled to dud funds? You can have no faith in what the government is telling you. You can have no faith in what your Treasurer is telling you. I ask the crossbench to consider this as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another factor that our amendment goes to is the timing of this bill, because in four weeks time this bill will become effective in every Australian workplace. The tax office isn't ready to implement it. Small-, medium- and large-sized businesses aren't ready to implement it. Australian workers know next to nothing about it—and certainly the superannuation funds will not be able to implement this bill either. So the timing needs to be considered. Our sensible amendment is on the side of small and medium-sized businesses in this country. It will push back the implementation of this bill as amended and as proposed to be amended by Labor.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the excellent speeches that was made in the second reading contribution on this debate was the speech given by the member for Warringah, a former barrister, a law officer, of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              , who pointed out that the reverse onus included in schedule 3 of this bill turns the law on its head. Normally a reverse onus in law is something that is only confined to the most egregious of criminal offences. We don't, for example, apply a reverse onus for heinous sex crimes. We don't apply a reverse onus for heinous drug crimes. But apparently not having your books in order is a worse offence than a serious sex offence. Apparently, not having your books in order is a worse offence than importing drugs into this country. This government has got their priorities all wrong. It is a simple amendment, a sensible amendment, and I ask all members of the House to support it.
             </p>
             <p>
              We want this bill to work. We support performance management. We support the amendment that has been moved by the government in removing this heinous power—more appropriate to this book here,
              <i>

               </a>
              </i>
              , than a modern Australian economy. So, if these amendments fail, we ask all members of the House to support the amendments that Labor has foreshadowed and I have just spoken to.

                This is very significant legislation that requires an enormous amount of change for the superannuation industry—and much of it justified. However, we are now in June. To have a start date for this legislation of 1 July when it is yet to even go to the Senate is, I believe, rush and haste. When you rush and you do things in haste, you make mistakes. I believe it would be far more prudent and wise of this House if we moved the start date for this legislation to 1 July 2022 rather than 2021. I believe that, if we are doing our job, that would give time for all the vested stakeholders to go through all the detail, and it would be far more prudent for our economy to get the best outcomes, which is what we all require.

                  (3) On 1 July each year, the Australian Government Actuary must publish a list of occupations where the rate of death in the workplace is more than one in 100,000 per year, averaged over a five-year period.

                  When I was 14 years of age, my family moved out of my family home. I could no longer go to my old school. But one of the guys that was working for my father at the time, a gentleman called Paul, was about three years older than me. He came and picked us up every day and drove me to school and drove me home. He was like a bit of an elder brother. A year later, he was involved in a car accident while doing a delivery to Newcastle. He lost his arm and lost part of the sight in his right eye. I've seen, over my career before I came to this place, many terrible accidents in the workplace. When I look at this legislation, there is a risk—and I acknowledge it's a small risk, but it only has to be one person—that, when we staple someone's funds, we will also staple their insurance policy. And there is a risk that, when someone moves from a job in an office—where the risk could be a paper cut or the photocopier lid closing down hard on their arm—to a dangerous occupation, they could suffer an injury and they might be underinsured. My conscience will not allow me to vote for any legislation that allows that risk, even if it is for one person. I hope I have support from the entire House on that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On amendment (3), I agree that we should be very careful in government about giving powers to ourselves to make decisions that override the private economy. I appreciate there are many decisions that we see from the large union-controlled super funds that are not necessarily in the best interests. Rather than get rid of that whole section, I have suggested that we have a list of special industries that are excluded from this provision. They would include mining; oil and gas extraction; oil and gas refining; cement and concrete products; hunting and the export of kangaroo meat; rubber, plastic and cable making industries; dredging and port authorities; dams and weirs; live cattle, sheep and other animal exports; and, of course, health and beauty. There is a longer list which everyone can read. I commend those amendments to the House.

                    These amendments are in respect of the change that is identified in relation to the definition of 'best financial interests' duty. Item 9 of the amendment bill omits 'best interests' and replaces it with 'best financial interests' in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The government states that it wishes to increase the accountability of trustees in their day-to-day operations and investing members' money. Whilst this may, at first blush, appear sensible, it has significant potential consequences for the interests and wellbeing of super members and is in fact not founded on any recommendation or proper basis. This is because, when considering whether something is in best financial interests alone, we also capture a large number of activities and investments that exist in a grey area and that may in fact be beneficial to members of super funds but are potentially now going to be excluded as a result of this amendment. For example, an ethical super fund purchasing carbon offsets or spending money planting trees to reduce emissions to achieve an overarching goal of reaching a net zero emissions goal around their investment portfolio—something which the member would arguably want—could now be prohibited under the best financial interests covenant, unless we have a major change from this government, in accepting putting a price on carbon or in actually ensuring that there is proper financial recognition of the impact of our emissions.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I don't think the change that is proposed in this bill by the government is necessary. Commissioner Hayne was clear that he saw the existing best interests covenant as adequate. The common-law definition was also upheld by Justice Jagot in APRA v Kelaher. Therefore, amendments (1) to (14) seek to omit any reference to 'financial' in the best interests covenant. This will amend schedule 3 of the bill and remove that reference to 'financial'. The government has refused to clarify that social corporate programs will not be excluded or targeted. In fact, they are likely to be targeted by this amendment. This raises serious questions as to the motivation and the true intent of the government with this amendment, and therefore I commend my amendments to the House.

                    <p>
                     I wish to make a short statement about the detailed amendments from the member for Warringah. Last night I set out my criticisms of schedule 3 of this bill. While I'm pleased to see the government capitulate on the absurd directions power that section 117A would have given to the Treasurer, there are still serious deficiencies in schedule 3. The Hayne royal commission explicitly opposed a revision of the best interests covenant. The Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia have also done the same, and they've done so for good reason, because there's no clear rationale for the wholesale revision of the best interests test. Schedule 3, as amended, would wipe out years of jurisprudence overnight and create needless uncertainty, and the last thing our super savings need is needless uncertainty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Limiting the best interests test to pure financial interests misunderstands people's relationship with their super. There are good reasons to use a stick to focus the minds of superannuation trustees to ensure that they're acting in their members' best interests, especially when it comes to political advertising or lobbying. But, if you have to use a sharp stick, do that, not a blunt rock like this. If the government wanted a sharp stick, it could have refined the existing covenants set out in section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. That would have allowed the government to weed out excessive spend on political advertising and lobbying without punishing ethical investments that are good for bank accounts and for our environment. If that's not what the government is intending then it should say so right now explicitly in this bill, not in regulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There are also many other parts of this bill outside of schedule 3 that could be improved with good amendments, including the sequencing issue, stapling in high-risk industries and the selective performance testing of some funds but not others. I'm committed to working with my crossbench colleagues in the Senate to continue to improve this bill, and I'll reserve my final judgement when it comes back to this House, amended, for final consideration.
