        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) shipbuilding is an industry that delivers the highest-value and most complex manufacturing outcomes produced in Australia, and therefore represents expertise and capacity that must be maintained for its very significant national economic and security benefits;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) as an example of the multiplier effects of shipbuilding projects in respect of the quality and range of manufacturing it both requires and enables, at the commencement of the Collins-class submarine project there were only 35 Australian companies certified to Defence quality standards, whereas by 1998 there were more than 1,500;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) there are currently more than 7,000 people employed in shipbuilding across Australia, including more than 4,000 people employed in naval shipbuilding alone;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Government has identified the need for more than 80 ships over the next 30 years for service in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) if Australian shipbuilding is not supported through a properly planned and managed program of project and maintenance work, it is likely that shipyards will close, thousands of jobs will be lost, and the critical expertise and capacity that have been developed will be irreparably squandered; and
       </p>

        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) provide certainty to the Australian shipbuilding industry and to thousands of Australian workers by settling a short, medium and long term program of government shipbuilding projects to ensure a balanced work flow and smooth delivery of key naval assets; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) bring forward relevant shipbuilding projects, including the Pacific patrol boat and replacement Anzac frigate projects, in a timely manner to ensure that shipyards, companies, and workers are not put at risk.

        (b) since 1980, the top 1 per cent income share has doubled, and the top 0.1 per cent income share has tripled; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) overall, inequality in Australia is now higher than it has been in three-quarters of a century;

        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) analysis by NATSEM (which the Prime Minister once described as 'the most reputable and authoritative modelling organisation in Australia') shows that the 2014-15 budget will redistribute income from lower-income households to higher-income households;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) by 2017-18, NATSEM analysis suggests that the budget will cause:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) across all households, a 2.2 per cent drop in disposable incomes in the bottom quintile, and an 0.2 per cent rise in disposable incomes in the top quintile;

        (3) calls upon the Government to rethink a budget that not only breaks promises and produces higher deficit figures than in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2014, but also fails the 'fair go test' by hurting low and middle income families.
