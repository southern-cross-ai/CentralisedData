        I rise to acknowledge one of the primary schools in my electorate, Darley Primary School, whose students had the enormous privilege of meeting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        when he was on his trip to Australia. Darley primary was one of two primary schools that had that honour, and I commend the students for their excellent behaviour during a very exciting time for them. I thank the people in this parliament who organised the meeting and supported the students. As you can imagine, it was a fairly nerve-racking experience for them, but I know that they acquitted themselves well and that it was the opportunity of a lifetime. So to Darley Primary School—the teachers and all the students, who had such a terrific opportunity to meet the President of the United States—I say: well done, and I hope that you will remember and treasure the experience for the rest of your lives. The meeting demonstrated something of what democracies are all about, so it was a great opportunity for Darley Primary School. I again thank the staff of the Serjeant-at-Arms's office, who looked after the students so well.
