       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to rise today to acknowledge the latest recipients of the Lions Children of Courage Awards in my community. The awards recognise and celebrate the courage and achievements of children who overcome additional barriers, such as disability, in their daily lives as well as highlighting the valuable contributions made by young siblings who help care for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured last month to attend the awards ceremony for nine wonderful, deserving childrenâ€”Hannah, Blake, Mahony, Taj, Angel, Ella, Darren, Dakota and Jemma. My congratulations go to them. The courage that these children show is humbling and inspiring. Congratulations also to the children from Petrie and Morayfield and from further afield in Pittsworth who were recognised as Children of Courage last weekend. I am sure that all their friends and families are very proud of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also say a big 'thank you' to Lioness Liz Alcock and the fabulous team at the Redcliffe Central Lioness Club. The 2012 year marked the club's 11th year as the hosts of this event in our region. I know that the club was also supported by the Redcliffe Central and North Lakes Lions clubs, and I want to acknowledge their support. Thanks and recognition must also go to the Redcliffe Leagues Club, which has been sponsoring these awards since they began in our community, and to Woody Point Special School for opening up their facilities for the awards to take place once again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I know that having a strong support network can make a world of difference in the lives of children with disability, so I would like to thank the families and carers who support our children of courage. I reiterate to you my commitment in seeing that all children get the support they deserve so they can aim for the stars.
