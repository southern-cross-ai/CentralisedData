       <p>
        It's my pleasure to rise and update the House on progress on a very important project in my electorate, the Kensington Gardens Reserve, which is a great combination of three good governmentsâ€”the federal government, the state government and the local Burnside council. I was there just a few weeks ago to be at the sod turning of that upgrade. We're committing $3 million to this project, as are the Burnside council. We are lucky that, with the recent state government announcement for local government stimulus grants, that project is going to be enhanced with an extra almost $800,000 from the state government. So now we've got all three levels of government coming together.

        We've now appointed the lead contractor and work has commenced. It was very exciting to be there with my colleagues the state member

        and Mayor Anne Monceaux to turn that sod. The project is going to take about six months. It's going to be a great outcome for the local community from two points of view. Firstly, we're dramatically improving the local amenity, installing a nature play for young kids in the area and better facilities for families to enjoy that great local asset. But, secondly, it's also a very significant environmental outcome, because Stonyfell Creek and the duck pond there is being turned into a significant wetland. We're going to make sure that the stormwater that flows through the local neighbourhood is better cleaned before it goes into Stonyfell Creek and ultimately the

        . I'm really proud of that commitment that we've made and, more importantly, that we're now delivering in my electorate of Sturt.
