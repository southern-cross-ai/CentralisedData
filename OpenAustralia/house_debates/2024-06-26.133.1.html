        formed in 1925. Wanda Surf Life Saving Club formed in 1946, and Elouera Surf Life Saving Club formed in 1967. The surf lifesavers in my electorate keep the electorate safe. There is a sense of community in these clubs, a sense of family and a sense of service. Each season, surf lifesavers spend in excess of 650,000 voluntary hours patrolling the most accessible and inaccessible beaches in
