       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to the first state member for Swansea,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bowman" rel="nofollow">
         Don Bowman
        </a>
        , who was born on 25 April 1936 and died on 30 April this year. He was elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in 1981 and he served there until 1988. When he lost the election over the Swansea Bridge issue—he was defeated by an Independent—he came back in 1991 and was the member for Swansea until 1995.
       </p>
       <p>
        When he retired in 1995, I followed him. Don was a mentor; he was a fantastic guy. He was very active in the Labor Party right up until when he became ill. He was a councillor on Lake Macquarie Council and he remained there until 1980 before he was elected to the state seat of Swansea. He won that very easily and then was re-elected in 1984. As I said, he lost the seat in 1988 but came back in 1991.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was always a partnership, Don and his wife Maggie. They worked together and they were both very active in the party. They were totally dedicated to their community. Don embodied the ideals of the Labor Party. He believed in fairness, equity and social justice and lived his life in accordance with those values. He was one of the most decent people I have known in my life. He was a straight talker and one of the most honest, loyal people I have ever met. He taught me the importance of maintaining these values. He was a clear thinker and presented logical argument—and he loved to argue!
       </p>
       <p>
        His intellect will always be remembered by everyone who knew him. He knew the importance of serving and he did this as an elected representative. He was a member of service groups and community groups as a volunteer. He also had a wicked sense of humour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don Bowman stood for preselection for the seat of Shortland in 1970. There was a lot of controversy around this preselection. He put together what I would say would be the first racing guide that has been put together in a preselection ballot. The introduction reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There was a close finish in 1970 with one horse appearing to win by a half head. Naturally a photo was called for but somehow the print was never developed. Despite several enquiries the stewards failed to come up with a decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1971 there was a re-run on the Sydney track. This time another horse was declared the winner but connections of two horses protested and there were many hostile demonstrations by rank and file Shortland punters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following a decision of the F.R.C.C—
       </p>
       <p>
        the Federal Racing Club Committee—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        the event will now be re-run at Shortland Park on 5th February 1972 …
       </p>
       <p>
        And that led to my predecessor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Morris
        </a>
        being elected. He has a form guide on all the contenders. He wrote of himself:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ran greenly first time in tending to pull early and run-wide. Shows some class and bred to stay.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don Bowman stayed and became the state member for Swansea. In talking about Peter Morris, he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Little more than a pony and not a brilliant galloper but a proven stayer and has had a solid preparation … Just failed to get up in Sydney when blocked … and expected to win well.
       </p>
       <p>
        That showed his unique sense of humour and the way that he looked at things. He will be deeply missed. In his first speech, the most poignant moment was when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the tumult and the shouting has died and today's captains and kings of the legislative endeavour have departed the scene, few will remember any clever words they may have uttered. No penetrating questions or brilliant ripostes at question time are likely to be in the newspaper headlines ten years hence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What will continue will be the physical state of the people of the electorate of Swansea and other people in New South Wales. The air, the earth and the water where they live will be the better or the worse for our efforts now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that is something that we in this parliament can remember.
