        My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer giving consideration to the establishment of a government bank and, if so, given the poor financial position of many state Labor governments, has a risk assessment of the new bank been undertaken by the Treasury and has it been scrutinised by the Commonwealth Loans Council?

         I have got nothing more to add to the answer that I gave before. I said very clearly that the government is prepared to examine any sensible and alternative measure. I have already said that the proposition put by the Acting Leader of the Opposition is completely absurd. I have made that very clear. I have made it very clear that the proposition put formally to the federal government by the Queensland Treasurer in communications with us directly by letter is not acceptable to the Commonwealth government. I have also made it very clear to the treasurers and to the premiers that we are happy to talk with them about what sensible measures could be taken over time to ensure that their capital works programs proceed in a way which strengthens our economy and ensures that infrastructure in this economy is builtâ€”is built because it is needed for the long-term productive potential of the economy but also, most particularly, proceeds now given the global financial crisis and what that means in terms of protecting jobs and protecting industry and strengthening our economy.
