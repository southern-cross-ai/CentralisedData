        I rise today to update the House on the Volunteer Grants program and the positive impact it has on sporting clubs and not-for-profits in my electorate of Swan. On Tuesday last week, the Minister for

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Porter" rel="nofollow">

        , visited my office to join with me in presenting more than $45,000 worth of volunteer grants to 13 clubs and organisations across the electorate of Swan. I would like to congratulate the following organisations on their success in this funding round: the Belmont Villa Soccer Club, represented by Keith Chambers and Niamh Chambers; the Cloverdale Comets Diamond Sports Association;

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">

        , represented by Samantha Fewster and Drew Mackay;

        </a>
        ; and the Turkish Australian Culture House, represented by Tuna Dincer. As you can see, we have so many volunteers in Swan who devote their time to our local sporting teams, community groups and not-for-profits. It is our volunteers that are really the heart and soul of our Swan community.
       </p>

        Following our grants presentation, we enjoyed an afternoon tea at my electorate office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It was also a great opportunity for the volunteers across these organisations to network and share their experiences. It was fantastic to hear them talk about the hard work they do for our community with their passion and their enthusiasm. I would like to share some of that with the House. Anne Latter and Sarndra Feast represented the Redcliffe Junior Football Club, which I have had a long association with. The club provide a quality playing environment for boys and girls, from Auskick through to 16-year-olds, and they are a very active club within the electorate of Swan. The money they have received through the grant is going towards updating their electronic, audio and video equipment.

        Delys Barry and Lynn Hoonhaut represented Santa's Workshop, which is based at

        </a>
        . Santa's Workshop started in 1998, with a mission to provide joy to children of prisoners at Christmas time. Now, Santa's Workshop busily works all year round and has expanded its reach. It now services other organisations that support disadvantaged children across Perth. With the funding from the volunteer grants program, Santa's Workshop is purchasing furniture, appliances and tools, which will help it make and fix even more toys for the children. Another example is the LinC Church Services Network Canning, which help the elderly in getting to doctors' appointments. As you can see, the volunteer grants greatly support the efforts of our volunteers across Australia and in my electorate of Swan.
