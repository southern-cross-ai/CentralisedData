        I want to thank all of those involved in helping to make what is already a great community in the federal seat of Petrie even greaterâ€”from the input of local residents who have highlighted issues to me that need to be addressed, right through to those in government who have listened to and acted on our concerns. Initiatives contained within the budget are wide ranging and include increased funding for veterans support, domestic violence initiatives, and the return of the stronger communities grants. The return of stronger community grants, in particular, as I am sure all members here would agree, is of enormous assistance to the many community groups that are often totally reliant on the dedication of volunteers, who do much heavy lifting in assisting some of the most vulnerable in our community.
       </p>

        I am also proud to say that every single school in the electorate of Petrie will see increased funding as a result of our investment in education. Parents, teachers, principals and school communities can now log on to the newly launched, publicly available online funding estimator so that they can see exactly how much extra funding they will receive as a result of the government's education investment. They can log on to education.gov.au/quality-schools. I had a bit of a look at the funding estimates before I came up here. I have the biggest state primary school in Queensland in my electorate for grades P to 6, Bounty Boulevard State School, which I have been out to many times for different events. It a great local school, approaching some 1,400 students in P to 6. The website estimates that this year, in 2017, Bounty Boulevard State School will receive $2,829,000 in federal government funding. Next year, in 2018, they will receive $2,973,900. Bounty Boulevard State School, I know, will use this really well.

        State School, in my electorate as well, has a fantastic principal, staff, and school P&amp;C. It is another great primary school in my electorate. This year they will receive $1,767,900 from the federal government. Next year they will receive $1,858,400, which I know Mango Hill will use really well. Up in

        , Christ the King Catholic Primary School is a great little school. It is a much smaller school. I have been there many times. The staff do a wonderful job and the community are strong. This year they will receive $2,342,700 from the federal government. Next year that will go to $2,429,300.

         Deception Bay State High School
        </a>
        has been fighting to ensure that their hall gets air conditioning at some time. I have been talking to the state member about that, as well as the opposition candidate for the upcoming state election. I think the school desperately needs that, and perhaps some of this funding will help. This year they received $3,354,100. Next year Deception Bay State High School will receive $3,525,900, which is fantastic. Mueller College is a big school at Rothwell, from grade P right through to year 12. They have a great principal there and great teaching staff. The students are exceptional. I went out there recently to talk about bullying. At the school gates, I spoke about bullying to all the young people coming in. Being a primary school and a high school, they will receive an additional $516,400 in the next 12 months from the federal government. Clontarf Beach State School is a great primary school, with a fantastic principal and staff. I am fighting for that school. You walk in there and it is like stepping back into the 1960s; the buildings are old and in need of a paint job, and it needs rendering. I am fighting for Clontarf Beach State School. I have written to the state member as well as the state opposition. Next year, Clontarf Beach State School will receive an additional $55,700. This is great news for students right through the Petrie electorate, and I will be supporting them.
