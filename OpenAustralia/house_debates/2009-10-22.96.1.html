        I rise today to speak about an exemplary sporting organisation that operates in my electorate, the Western Suburbs District Junior Rugby League. The sheer numbers that this organisation deals with on a weekly basis are truly impressive. Let me share with the House some of those numbers associated with the 2009 season: 236 teams, 3,989 registered players and 1,400 volunteers. That means nearly 4,000 young people are given the opportunity to be active and healthy week in and week out during the rugby league season. By the way, that is all thanks to the 1,400 volunteers who help run each and every game. The hard work shown by players and volunteers was evident in the first and second weeks of September, when the Western Suburbs District Junior Rugby League hosted the grand finals for 66 teams, from under-8s through to the open A-grade competition.

        I went along to watch a few games at Campbelltown Sports Stadium on 5 September, and I was truly impressed by the talent that was on display. I can assure the chamber that rugby league in south-west Sydney is absolutely strong and bright. I want to extend my personal congratulations to all teams who competed in the grand finals, to the winners and to those gallant in defeat. The true meaning of sportsmanship was on display that day. Of course, grand finals and the whole season would not have been possible without the 1,400 volunteers that I mentioned earlier.

        I would like to reserve special mention for the

        of the Western Suburbs District Junior Rugby League, Julie Luke, and her board chairman, Wayne Hardy-Smith. I have had the pleasure of knowing Julie Luke since my son started playing rugby league well over 20 years ago. In those days, Julie was a young mum looking after her son’s rugby league club, the Ingleburn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Now she oversees the entire competition, run throughout south-west Sydney. Together with Wayne Hardy-Smith, they have proven to be invaluable administrators of this great sport and of one of, quite frankly, the largest junior rugby leagues in the country. The passion that these two people have shown to the game of rugby league is truly commendable. Their commitment to developing and promoting rugby league as an enjoyable, healthy, safe sport must be applauded. Julie and Wayne, together with the entire board, showed great foresight this year when they joined the New South Wales Country Rugby league Group 6 to establish the inaugural joint rugby league for senior grades. This competition has 52 teams, from under-18 teams through to all-age teams. The partnership will help to strengthen the ability of players and also to strengthen the game as a whole. The hard work of Julie and Wayne Hardy-Smith is evident to all who reside in Liverpool, Camden or the immediate surrounds. I look forward to attending the junior rugby league’s presentation night this Saturday to celebrate the triumph of the 2009 season.
