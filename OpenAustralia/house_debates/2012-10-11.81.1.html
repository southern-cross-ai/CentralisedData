         I thank the member for her question. We as a House have just had the opportunity to reflect on what these bombings meant to our nation, what they meant to each of us and the way in which Australians will go about their memorials and reflections tomorrow. To provide further details of the kinds of events that will happen tomorrow: they will enable Australians to have the opportunity and the moment to reflect, if they choose to involve themselves in a public event or even watch it on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

         . Many people, of course, will do their reflection in their most private moments, but the government will hold memorial services in Bali and in Canberra. These services will provide an opportunity for people to gather to remember those killed and injured in the Bali tragedy. I will represent the government at the service in Bali, along with the Leader of the Opposition and former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister John Howard
         </a>
         , while the Governor-General will lead the Canberra service. Further details about these memorial services can be found at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         website for anyone who wants to see the very specific details.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has announced a comprehensive assistance package for families of those killed and seriously injured in the attacks planning to attend either memorial service. For many of the families, this will be a time where they do want to return to Bali and be there at the place where they lost their loved one and where their family was cost so much. For others, that clearly will not be possible. Some will exercise the option of attending the service in Canberra. For some, of course, that will not be their way of grieving. They will not want to take themselves to a public event; they will want to do something far more intimate and private with their own family members. But, for those Australians who lost so much who do want to attend these services, a package has been made available. That is providing a similar level of support to victims and family members as that provided by the Howard government for the first anniversary in 2003. The package includes assistance with airfares, accommodation and ground transport. Even at this late stage, if people want to ring the Bali Memorial Hotline on 136125, more details can be provided.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our thoughts will be with these family members tomorrow as our nation grieves and remembers this event that radically changed our country.
