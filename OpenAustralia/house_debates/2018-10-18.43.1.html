        The only thing in that speech that made sense was the quote from the member for Goldstein. In 2002, Geoff Searl won the Pittwater Medal for service to the community—an entirely deserving recognition for all he has done in my electorate. Geoff's great passion for health, history and the environment has placed him at the forefront of many initiatives, most notably the Avalon Beach Historical Society. Geoff formed the historical society in September 1983 with the aim of collecting visual, literary and oral artefacts of the Avalon area. The society provides lectures to many community groups, hosts noble speakers at their general meetings, and conducts tours of historic homes and iconic monuments throughout the area. Since the society's formation, Geoff has also been responsible for the displaying of eight photographic exhibitions—a remarkable feat, given its relatively brief existence. Geoff has also contributed to the Mackellar community through his significant volunteer work. As a young man, Geoff was chief gear steward and chief instructor of the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving Club. Years later, in 1998, he was inspired to begin patrolling once again, after writing the 75-year history of the surf club for its publication. About nine years ago, Geoff also formed the Angophora Bushcare Group, which takes up to 10 volunteers to look after Angophora Reserve on a weekly basis. I have one other thing to say: Dave Sharma deserves to be elected as the next member for Wentworth.
