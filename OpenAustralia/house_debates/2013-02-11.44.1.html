        we recognise the amazing contribution that some of our citizens make to our community. This year, an individual receiving the highest honour and recognition in the

         City of Fairfield

        was a good friend of mine, Dr Mavis Jean Robinson, better known to many of us as Aunty Mae. Aunty Mae was deservedly named Fairfield Citizen of the Year. As a Fairfield citizen for over 40 years, Aunty Mae is dearly loved and respected by young and old alike. Proving my theory that many of our noblest people are often drawn to become teachers, Aunty Mae has done much to improve the educational outcomes of Aboriginal youth throughout our communities. Through her work—particularly at primary schools and secondary schools and at the department of education in general—Aunty Mae has done much to encourage improved teaching techniques, particularly in the areas of reading and literature. She has also contributed much to the education of Aboriginal youth by contributing to the development of the Aboriginal curriculum and participating in the development of the South-West Sydney Aboriginal Student Achievement Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aunty Mae is revered by our local Aboriginal community, as well as the community in general in both Liverpool and Fairfield. Her warm spirit and effort to foster harmony have truly touched many who have had the privilege to meet her. I would like to thank Aunty Mae for her wonderful contribution and to congratulate her on being named Fairfield Citizen of the Year for 2013.
