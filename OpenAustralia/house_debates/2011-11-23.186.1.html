It is a role we love; we take pride and pleasure in sharing with visitors from all over the world our beautiful environment, our diverse culture, our Indigenous heritage and of course the famous wind known as the Fremantle doctor. This sailing extravaganza represents an excellent opportunity for the

       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to make special mention of 1983 America's Cup crew member and project manager John Longley, who has been vital in the development of Perth 2011 in his role as event director. I say thank you to John and his team for all their effort and hard work. Special attention should also be given to the Fremantle,

        The Australian government also funded the Emerging Nations Program, a series of intensive training programs leading up to Perth 2011 designed to improve the skills of young sailors from emerging nations such as Moldova, India, Serbia, Mexico and the Philippines. Over the last 12 months the City of Fremantle has been working closely with the state and federal government to prepare for the tens of thousands of visitors who will pass through Fremantle for the two weeks of the event. The 'Worlds Village' is the centrepiece of Perth 2011, located in Fremantle's famous fishing boat harbour. The village will host competitor activities, cultural events, live music and a big screen displaying live coverage of all races. Many constituents have said they feel the same buzz in the air as when the Australian

        Perth 2011 represents a wonderful opportunity for sailing in Australia and to showcase the magnificent multicultural port city of Fremantle to the world. I congratulate the Perth 2011 team, the City of Fremantle, the state and federal governments and everyone involved in bringing this world-class event to fruition.
