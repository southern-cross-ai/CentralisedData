        Warwick Parer was a Bonner constituent, and he was also a friend. I first met Warwick in the early 1990s. His son Justin and I were in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
         Young Liberals
        </a>
        , and I was invited over to the Parer household to meet with Karen Rasey—who was the Young Liberal President. Little did I know that it was part of a predetermined plan to have me sign up to the Young Liberal executive, and Karen was not going to allow me to leave the Parer residence unless I signed the nomination form then and there. There was the start of the influence Warwick Parer and his family had in helping me pursue my career in politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that Warwick helped many people start a career in politics, and that is because he dedicated his life to public service. Warwick was also an inspiration when events did not seem positive at the time. I remember that he was the Queensland Liberal President when I lost my seat, in 2007. He made me feel like I had achieved something by saying to me and others, 'if only we had a swing against the government, like we had a swing against us in Bonner, we would still be in government'. Recently he scrutineered the biggest booth in Bonner, in last year's federal election, and he was able to analyse the result and report back to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I treasure the last hour of manning that booth with Warwick as we shared many memorable stories with each other. He would always attend functions with his supportive and loving wife Kathi. One of the rare times when I did not see them both together was Tuesday last week, when we were honoured to be hosting a dinner in Bonner for the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Ruddock" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Ruddock
        </a>
        . It was only when speaking to Drewe Freeburn, the event organiser, that he informed me of how Warwick was looking forward to attending the event. However, he had been hospitalised just prior to it. Warwick still wanted Kathi to attend, and we all passed on our well wishes to Kathi for Warwick's speedy recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warwick's greatest achievement by far was his family. Justin and I had been friends since the early 1990s, and Warwick would always talk about Justin and his great achievements, from raising a family to his successful business ventures. Justin, your father was very, very proud of you, and especially of your determination to succeed. Justin is one of Warwick's three sons. Warwick married Kathi 40 years ago, and their love produced four daughters and three sons: Carol, Martine, Helen, Sonia, Warwick, Justin and Rowan. Their family includes four sons-in-law: Peter, Lee, Chris and Bruce, a daughter-in-law Jenny, and 18 grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.
