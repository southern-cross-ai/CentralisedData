        The Stronger Communities Program delivers real benefits to many local organisations. Round 3 is now open. The first two rounds have already provided $300,000 over two years to every electorate in the country and by the end of this year that rises to $450,000. This federal funding aims to improve local participation and cohesion and contribute to development of an even more vibrant Bennelong community. If any community group within Bennelong has a project that needs doing but there's not enough in the budget to get it done, then they should immediately apply. My office will accept expressions of interest to the end of this week. These grants are available to local organisations to fund tangible new infrastructure projects within Bennelong to deliver positive benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have assembled a local infrastructure committee of local community champions, which will ensure these grants will go where they can do the most good for our community. Under their leadership past rounds of these grants have had wonderful results. The highlight would be the $20,000 provided to our local special needs school, Karonga. This will allow them to put in a wheelchair ramp which will lead up to their tennis courts—a very important sport—and sports fields, allowing all students to get out and get active. They will now have access to sport, which is a critical part of every child's development. Epping Boys High has received a grant for their kitchen cafe, a wonderful initiative that teaches students barista skills and helps many stay on track. Morrison Bay will have lights under the scheme, allowing more people to take part in community sport. Our local community radio station, 2RRR, will get a well-deserved upgrade of its ageing equipment. Christian Community Aid will use the grant to set up a mobile playgroup to help grandparents, foster parents and others who often need support in raising children. The Eastwood Occasional Child Care Centre was able to update and modernise their outdoor play area.
       </p>

        Without this type of grant such projects would always be left lower down the priority list, resulting in them potentially never being completed. Churches, childcare centres, schools, charities and many other fantastic community groups will benefit from this excellent federal grants scheme. This program has the power to transform the community for the better by allowing local groups to expand, reach more people and flourish. I would encourage all local groups to apply in the remaining few days so we can build a stronger community.
