        My question is to the Prime Minister. Over 11,000 civilians have been killed in the bombing and invasion of Gaza, including over 4,000 children. The government says it's concerned by the number of deaths—but, clearly, not enough to stop backing the invasion. Prime Minister, what is the number of deaths and how many more children must die before Labor will join France and most of the world in calling for a ceasefire?

         I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. We have said very clearly that Israel does have a right to defend itself. We have also said that the way that it does matters, and we must distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian citizens. We have said the same thing consistently. I have said the same thing to President Herzog, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to the head of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Palestinian Authority
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas" rel="nofollow">
          Mahmoud Abbas
         </a>
         , who I spoke with last week. I have said very clearly that every Israeli and every Palestinian life matters—every one: every child, every baby, every innocent civilian.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say with respect to the member for Melbourne that during this debate it does not assist to suggest that somehow the government or indeed any individual, unless you have some basis for it, is dismissive of the loss of life of people in Gaza or in Israel. I have met with the Islamic leadership of this country from right around the country. I have met with Jewish community leaders. This is a really difficult time, and community cohesion matters. The attempt to somehow say that Australia is engaged in on-the-ground action almost with some of the comments you read is just not accurate and is not appropriate in my view.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have said that we want humanitarian pauses as the necessary first step. We have said that any step on the path to ceasefire can't be one-sided. Hamas is still bombing Israel, still using human shields and still holding more than 200 hostages. I've said really consistently that Hamas has contempt for international law—they're a terrorist organisation—but Israel, as a democratic nation, has the responsibility to uphold international law and to protect innocent lives and to protect civilians, including children. It's a message I give here and it's a message I gave when I spoke to leaders in those countries as well.
