       <p>
        I stand here today completely outraged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government and how they are letting down Townsville's small businesses after our worst natural disaster in history. The LNP government is excluding small business owners from the $75,000 recovery grants. Townsville's small businesses are doing it very tough. Not only are some trying to rebuild their homes but they are also trying to rebuild their businesses. It is outrageous that the LNP would leave small business owners, in their time of need, to hang out to dry. The LNP government has made multiple unfair restrictions on Townsville people and small business owners. There should be one rule and one rule only. If it's flooded, you get federal relief funding. If your small business is flooded, you get federal assistance. It's that simple.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the LNP's government's harsh restrictions to access vital funding, businesses like New Park Suit Hire and Menswear are excluded. The force of the floodwaters were so great that they knocked the doors off their building on Charters Towers Road. Mr McGinty has owned that store for 38 years, and he is now trying to prepare for a very big year ahead with Townsville weddings. He is booked out for this entire month, but he has lost all of his stock. He needs funding now to accommodate his clients for their special days. Mr McGinty should have access to the $75,000 federal grant, but he is being denied this right by this LNP government. I demand that the LNP government lift these harsh and stringent restrictions.
