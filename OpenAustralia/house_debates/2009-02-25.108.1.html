        I rise to condemn the actions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         National Australia Bank
        </a>
        in placing all of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Warley Hospital
        </a>
        ’s assets on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        up for sale on a forced basis. Warley Hospital had a proud, 90-year tradition of being supported and funded by, and of serving, the people of Phillip Island and those who visit the island. That hospital had a bright future. Sadly, it was forced to close a year ago, following the decision of the incoming Rudd government not to match the Howard government’s $2.5 million rescue and recovery plan for Warley Hospital. We have previously discussed that decision. I believe that that was a tragic error of judgment and a mean-spirited act by the new government which condemned the island to the loss of a vital community facility. However, the assets remained. The island is committed to ensuring a healthy future for its people, with a locally owned, locally managed, locally run hospital service committed to the people of Phillip Island.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, the National Australia Bank has moved to sell all assets, and the advice I have is that it has placed the entire assets of Warley Hospital on the market, when only a portion of those assets would be needed to be sold to cover outstanding debts. The National Australia Bank, I am advised, has been the banker for Warley Hospital since 1926. What I think is extraordinary is that the bank has taken these actions; it is destroying these assets, and it is doing so in a way which risks their value and which takes funds out of the community and makes it much harder for the community to have an independent hospital owned by the community. I clearly, absolutely, categorically condemn the actions of the National Australia Bank. They should rethink their actions. They should be part of a future for the Warley Hospital. This is community vandalism. If, in any way, ACCV has been a party to forcing this sale, then they should be condemned unequivocally.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we need now for Phillip Island is twofold: the federal government must step in and provide the money which was pledged by the previous government to Phillip Island, to the support of hospital and emergency services and to an independent, stand-alone facility for Phillip Island, and, in addition, the National Australia Bank should stop, desist, apologise and work with the Warley Hospital board for a Warley Hospital future for Phillip Island.
