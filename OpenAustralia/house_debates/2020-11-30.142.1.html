        I rise to speak about some incredible young achievers in the electorate of Ryan. Each year I run the Young Leadership Award, where local schools put forward students who have gone above and beyond and excelled themselves. This year, more than ever, has been a difficult year for these students, and their leadership amongst their peers has been even more important. So it is a great pleasure to recognise them all.
       </p>

        I will start with Ameya from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigidine_College" rel="nofollow">
         Brigidine College
        </a>
        . As a Youth Champion of the Queensland Family and Child Commission, Ameya has done fantastic work amongst her peers. She works with other youth, providing consultation and action plans for kids on topics such as drugs, alcohol and sex education. Her focus on young families is absolutely commendable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Millie Kent, also at Brigidine College, in year 11, has done a terrific job as well. She is part of the college's Environment Club, raising awareness of recycling and sustainability. She is in the Justice and Democracy Group and also works for the St Vincent de Paul Society. Millie participated in the Peer Skills Program training workshop and is now a peer mentor to her fellow students. During such a tough year, her efforts amongst her cohort have been outstanding. Well done, Millie.

        Malia Knox, who is in year 3 at Milton State School, is an incredible young woman. She is only in year 3, but she went out and identified a deficit among women in the form of statues, pictures, plaques and representations of the wonderful work that women do in our community. She started the #FemaleFaces4PublicPlaces campaign and worked with her local politician to improve female recognition in our local area. Tahlia Wyllie, from year 8 at

         Ferny Grove State High School

        , is a member of the Dreamcatcher program, which inspires leaders who desire to develop their leadership skills. She is an up-and-comer within the Ferny Grove State High School cohort and her leadership skills were greatly appreciated amongst her peers this year. She's also a keen fundraiser with the Sanfilippo Children's Foundation, raising over $239,000 for the foundation. Cassidy Ratcliff, a year 11 student at Ferny Grove State High, School is president of the school's Interact team. In 2020, Cassidy facilitated the Easter egg drive, raising much needed donations for the children's hospital and, on

        , is a fantastic leader in his local community. He's a keen environmentalist and a keen fisherman who's taking practical action to remove pest fish from his local waterways. I congratulate him. Josh Ho, in year 10 at The Gap State High School, stepped up in a big way in a difficult year for all students. He supported his peers, particularly in
