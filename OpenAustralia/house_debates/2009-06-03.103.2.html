        Koondoola is a small suburb in the south of my electorate of Cowan that has its share of challenges. While Koondoola is doing it tough, when I look around Koondoola I see great potential. I spend a lot of time in Koondoola and I have met a lot of people who genuinely care and are committed to a better Koondoola, as I am. Koondoola is well served by four schools in the suburb. I have visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_College" rel="nofollow">
         Mercy College
        </a>
        , Waddington Primary School, Koondoola Primary School and the Burbridge School on many occasions. The reality is that the schools are the biggest and most inclusive places in the suburb of Koondoola. It is through education that potential can be achieved. That is why I like to go to schools and tell young students that, one day, any one of them could be a prime minister, a doctor, a pilot, or a member of any profession or trade. I say that because I believe it, but it is only through hard work and education that each child can achieve their potential. I know that the leadership and teachers at each of those schools recognise that fact. I know that the parents in Koondoola look at their children and see the same potential that I see.
       </p>
       <p>
        I see the great potential of Koondoola not just in the next generation but also in those people who care enough right now to stand up and be counted. I talk not only of those who volunteer in the community but also of the committed men and women of the Koondoola Advancement Committee. Although my duties in parliament have stopped me from attending their meetings, I have met with their representatives on several occasions. I am confident that they are committed solely to the best interests of Koondoola and their fellow residents. They are committed to progress and they are committed to seeing Koondoolaâ€™s potential realised. At last there is a truly non-partisan, independent organisation that believes in Koondoola. I urge the residents of Koondoola to get behind the Koondoola Advancement Committee.
       </p>

        It would be wrong of me not to speak of the most important issue that affects Koondoola. I speak of course of the critical need for redevelopment of the Koondoola Plaza shopping centre. The current centre is in terrible shape. It is poorly designed and it is run-down. It is the sort of centre that is only used by those who have no choice. The result is no competition, declining revenues and declining employment. Its potential is unfulfilled. The shopping centre must be redeveloped and the people of Koondoola must be given a decent facility that they want to use, that they feel safe visiting and that they would be happy to work in. Responsibility for this rests with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        . Wanneroo was given $1 million by the state government to assist with the project, and the people of Koondoola want the shopping centre redevelopment begun and completed quickly. The entire suburb of Koondoola is being held back by the shopping centre. I urge the City of Wanneroo to pursue the redevelopment and the people of Koondoola to make the suburb a great place to live. I believe in the great potential of Koondoola and I am grateful to represent the people of that suburb.
