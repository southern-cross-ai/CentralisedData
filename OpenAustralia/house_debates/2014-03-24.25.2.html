        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the committee's second report of 2014
        <i>
         Referrals made December 2013
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”This report deals with five referrals, with a total estimated cost of $446.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first referral was from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Australia
        </a>
        , for the development and construction of housing for defence at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Tindal in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . The project cost is $89.4 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence Housing Australia proposes to construct 50 tropically designed dwellings and associated supporting roads and infrastructure for use by Defence personnel and their families at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Tindal" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Tindal
        </a>
        , Northern Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee visited RAAF Base Tindal and held hearings in Katherine in late January. The committee subsequently sought additional information on the project from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
         DHA
        </a>
        and has also requested a further public and in camera hearing. The committee will report again on the project after the additional hearings have been conducted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second inquiry in this report examined the construction of a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        in Nairobi, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Kenya" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Kenya
        </a>
        . The project cost is $57.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        told the committee that Australia's engagement with Kenya, and Africa more broadly, has grown significantly in recent years as has Australia's representation in Nairobi. The current chancery, which is leased, no longer meets the department's security requirements and has significant building and fire-compliance deficiencies. The proposed purpose-built complex will serve as Australia's ongoing permanent mission to Kenya.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is satisfied that there is a need for the new purpose-built high commission complex in Nairobi and recommends that the project proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third inquiry being reported on examined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's proposal to relocate its research capabilities and staff from its site at Highett in Victoria to its site at Clayton, Victoria. The project includes the provision of a new building at Clayton for the '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        Science Education Centre' and a 'Factories of the Future Innovation Centre'. The project cost is $32 million. The cost of the works will be offset by the sale of CSIRO's Highett site.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fourth inquiry examined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        of Australia's proposal to construct a National Banknote Site adjacent to the Bank's existing facilities in Craigieburn, Victoria. The project cost is $72 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of the National Banknote Site would enable the transition to the 'Next Generation Banknote' series and it would meet the Reserve Bank's storage, distribution and processing requirements for the next 25 years. It will also allow for the relocation and expansion of the existing National Note Processing and Distribution Centre and will include storage capacity to accommodate the Reserve Bank's banknote holdings that are currently held at the bank's Melbourne site.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fifth and final inquiry being reported on examined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's proposal to consolidate its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        property holdings by relocating staff from various leased premises in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        to CSIRO's own site at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Black Mountain
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The consolidation project includes construction of two new science research and support facilities on the Black Mountain campus and the eventual demolition of several buildings at Black Mountain which are old, which do not meet current standards for health and safety, have high maintenance costs and which present operational risk. The project cost is $195.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries and also thank the secretariat for their work. I commend the report to the House.
