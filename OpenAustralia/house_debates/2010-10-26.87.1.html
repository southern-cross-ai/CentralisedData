       <p>
        I wish to draw the attention of the House to the recent canonisation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_of_the_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary of the Cross
        </a>
        and the special significance it has for my electorate. One of the things that so many Canberrans admire about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Mary" rel="nofollow">
         Mother Mary
        </a>
        is her legacy on education. Mother Mary realised the power that education has in changing lives for the better and its transformative qualities. Her dedication to educating all, regardless of their ability to pay, is something that guided her throughout her life and led her to form the Sisters of St Joseph of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart
        </a>
        . These sisters came from all walks of life and dedicated themselves to the education of young Australians from every part of the country and from every means.
       </p>
       <p>
        This legacy is continued to this day at St Mary Mackillop Catholic College in my electorate in Tuggeranong. The college is a co-ed school for years 7 to 10, which operates from two campuses. The college is the largest Catholic school in Canberra. The college’s motto of faith and courage is drawn from the inspiration of St Mary of the Cross and serves to guide the school in all its activities. St Mary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKillop_Catholic_College" rel="nofollow">
         MacKillop Catholic College
        </a>
        takes great pride in its namesake. When the imminent canonisation of St Mary was announced, the school sought feedback from its community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church
        </a>
        to change its name from ‘MacKillop Catholic College’ to ‘St Mary MacKillop Catholic College’. That feedback was overwhelmingly positive and the school officially changed its name in January this year to recognise the sainthood of its patron.
       </p>
       <p>
        To underscore its commitment to its patron, the school also sent a small delegation of staff and students to Rome to witness the ceremony. Principal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lee" rel="nofollow">

        was joined by assistant principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_White" rel="nofollow">
         Lois White
        </a>
        , and students Oliver Oakman, Danica Tagaza, Isabelle Schmidt and Andre Wilks to witness the canonisation mass. Back home, students at both campuses also held special assemblies in honour of the day and received commemorative medals in recognition of the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another activity that has been taking place at the college and other colleges in Canberra is the Gillard government’s investment in St Mary MacKillop College and Merici,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clare" rel="nofollow">
         St Clare
        </a>
        ’s and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Francis_Xavier" rel="nofollow">
         St Francis Xavier
        </a>
        . The Gillard Labor government has provided $5.7 million in terms of a grant for a trade training centre that will offer a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        pathway for Certificate III in Hospitality. The trade training centre will join the many around the country to provide a year 12 equivalent and better job prospects, and address the critical skill shortages affecting not only Canberra—and I mentioned this yesterday in my 90-second statement—in terms of trade shortages here but also the nation.
