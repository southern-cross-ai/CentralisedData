        Nearly two weeks ago, we celebrated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        in my electorate. Australia Day is an important day for my constituents. Many of them turn out to local council events to celebrate the day and to celebrate the swearing-in of our new citizens. Celebrations and citizenship ceremonies were held across my electorate by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Canning" rel="nofollow">
         City of Canning
        </a>
        , the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Park
        </a>
        . One of the best aspects of the City of South Perth’s ceremony is that it takes place on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River" rel="nofollow">
         Swan River
        </a>
        foreshore, a very public part of Perth, where the community can be involved. In fact, during the ceremony many people out for their morning exercise stopped to take part in the event.
       </p>

        Gerry Ganning performed the

Fortunately, I was at the back and did not have to dance with the rest of the dignitaries down the front. Congratulations to all our new citizens, including Mr Peter Betz, Miss Simrat Kaur, Mr Aminur Rahaman, Mr Junku Kin, Daniel Milner, Parveen Kumar Ponniah, Tanya Moyle, Wing Lee and

        At the City of Canning ceremony, Russell Gorton was awarded the City of Canning Local Citizen of the Year award for his work in the Canning River Wetlands. Russell is an outstanding individual who balances running his small businesses with being president of the Wilson Wetlands Action Group and taking part in environmental action. Russell and I have been working closely together on a number of local issues and he came to my office on Friday with the River Guardians to help celebrate
