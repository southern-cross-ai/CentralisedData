        <p>
         on indulgence—Mr Speaker, can I add to your warm welcome of Prime Minister Hipkins. We had a very constructive meeting today.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         are not just friends; we're family. We engage in our economic relationship, which is so important. Probably the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CER" rel="nofollow">
          CER
         </a>
         is the world-class example of the best free trade agreement you could possibly have. On top of that, regarding the migration issues, we're working through streamlining citizenship arrangements between Australia and New Zealand. We hope to conclude those matters prior to Anzac Day. We will be co-hosts of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA" rel="nofollow">

         , and it is a big deal for Australia and New Zealand. I look forward to continuing the close relationship between our countries, and I know that this is an issue as well that goes right across the chamber. We are friends, we will remain friends and you are very warmly welcomed. Thank you for giving us the honour of making your first international visit to Australia. It says a lot.

         <p>
          on indulgence—On behalf of the coalition, I extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister Hipkins and congratulate him on his election and his appointment to this position. I also acknowledge the high commissioner, who is a very good friend of our country. We speak in a united front in relation to our relationship with our friends just across the ditch. It's a very integral part of our family. It's more important than ever that our two countries come together to stand for the values that we've fought together for over a long period of time, and with the engagement that New Zealand has with many smaller nations, in particular in the Indo-Pacific, that relationship is more crucial than ever.
         </p>
         <p>
          We look forward to the occasions where we can continue to work together and the occasions—particularly around rugby and cricket—where we can agree to disagree in a time-honoured tradition. You are a most welcome guest here, and it is a great pleasure and honour to have you in the chamber.
