        I rise today to offer my condolences to the people who have felt the full brunt of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">
         Mother Nature
        </a>
        ’s fury over the past few days in the great state of Victoria. The people I so proudly represent in this place, the people of Solomon, have had their own history of natural disaster and mass human suffering. On their behalf, I say this to the people of Victoria: our hearts go out to you at this terrible time. You have suffered more than any human beings deserve to suffer. Our thoughts are with you as you wait for news of your loved ones who have not been accounted for, as you learn of your loved ones who did not make it and as the realisation comes of the valuable lifelong possessions, family homes and much loved pets that have been lost. It is my hope that you feel the arms of the entire country wrapped around you. The hurt I feel in my heart for you is equalled by the hurt felt by my people back in Darwin and Palmerston. I have had many emails and phone calls from my people offering support. While we can understand to a point, none of us will really know the horror that was bestowed on you and your communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced a plan that delivered a welcome investment to local infrastructure and to support jobs in Darwin and Palmerston. This plan strikes the right balance between supporting growth and jobs now and delivering the investments needed to strengthen the economy for the long term. In the past four months, the outlook for the global economy has deteriorated significantly, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
         IMF
        </a>
        now forecasting a deep global recession. The global slowdown has driven almost all major advanced economies into recession, including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Europe. China and India are now also slowing sharply and the global mining boom which has provided a big stimulus to Australia’s growth in recent years is unwinding. Faced with this situation, the Australian government had a choice. The first option was to do nothing and let the market rip. The second was to act now to support jobs and growth. The Rudd government is committed to the latter—that is, when the markets have failed the government must intervene and support jobs and growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan will deliver almost $30 billion in direct investment into schools, housing and roads as well as other essential local infrastructure. It also includes almost $3 billion in temporary tax rebate expansion for small business to encourage private sector investment. Over 6,000 families in Darwin and Palmerston will receive a back-to-school bonus of $950 to help with the cost of kids returning to school. Over 2,000 students and people looking for work in Solomon will receive a training and learning bonus of $950 to support their study costs. Every one of our hardworking primary schools—some 41 of them—will have capital funding provided for essential new buildings and upgrades. At Lyons, 185 new Defence houses will be built, which will have a positive flow-on effect for the rental market. There will be a $1,600 rebate for solar panel installation which is not subject to means testing.
       </p>
       <p>
        National programs include an additional $30 million in 2008-09 and $60 million in 2009-10 which will be allocated to an extended coverage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        . As the chairman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        black spots committee I know that this additional funding will be extremely welcome and it will save lives. The plan is also to provide an additional $500 million over two years to expand the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program strategic projects. This program invests in community infrastructure such as town halls, libraries, community centres and sports centres, something I know the hardworking lord mayors of Darwin and Palmerston will be very excited about sharing in.
       </p>
       <p>
        The initiative also provides funding of $6 billion over 3½ years for the construction of new social housing and a further $400 million over two years for repairs and maintenance to existing public housing dwellings. This will help stimulate businesses which supply construction materials and help to retain jobs in the industry, something I know my mates in the building game are very happy about.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a decisive action to support and bolster the economy in the short term. More importantly, it will also lay the groundwork for the stronger economy when we emerge from the global recession. I would like to also take this opportunity to acknowledge all the speakers in the last two days, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, who was fantastic yesterday, and the Leader of the Opposition. The contribution today from all speakers was excellent under very trying and difficult circumstances. It shows that all members of this House—150 of us—care for the nation. There has been a fantastically united, sombre feel in the House and I would like to acknowledge those speakers.
