        I rise tonight to welcome and express my support for the public works motion put forward in parliament last week by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Gray

        , for the redevelopment of the Scottsdale

        and Technology Organisation's facility in my electorate of Bass.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Snowdon" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Snowdon
        </a>
        , joined me at Scottsdale to announce the $18.7 million, plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , project to redevelop the Scottsdale Defence Science and Technology Organisation's nutrition research facility. The works at the facility will include the redevelopment of food technology facilities, upgrading of the existing chemistry and nutrition laboratories and improvements to the site infrastructure and working areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Scottsdale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
         DSTO
        </a>
        facility researches and manufactures the freeze dried components used in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        patrol ration packs and has been producing these since the early 1970s. In fact, Scottsdale is the only facility in Australia to both produce food and to undertake research into the nutritional value of ration packs and rationing systems used by the Australian Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding will generate employment opportunities in a region of Tasmania that has faced some difficulties in the recent past. It is an announcement welcomed by the community. It reiterates that the federal government is committed to the people of Scottsdale and that Defence has a long-term future in the region. I am pleased that the Public Works Committee will conduct a hearing at Scottsdale on 27 July regarding this project that has been proposed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor
        </a>
        government. This is good news for the people of the north-east of Tasmania. The redevelopment will result in a modern science facility that will be equipped to meet the nutritional needs of Australian Defence Force personnel. This project, through the public works motion in parliament last week, is furthering the Australian Labor government's commitment to the Scottsdale DSTOâ€”something that the Liberals, for 11 long years, neglected and failed to do anything about.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a lot of scaremongering by opposition members in this place about the future of the DSTO facility. It is a pity that, as Senator Barnett leaves this place, he continually causes unnecessary uncertainty in and misleading of the north-east community. The future of Scottsdale DSTO is strong. It will continue to play a leading role in food technology and will continue to play an important role in the local community and economy. The government is committed to the modernisation and sustainability of this facility. It is a shame that certain opposition members cannot show the same level of commitment instead of causing unrest and uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction is due to start later this year, subject to parliamentary clearance, with an estimated completion date of late 2013. This is great news for the people of north-east Tasmania. The redevelopments will not only bring employment opportunities to the region, which has suffered a number of setbacks over recent times, but also provide an opportunity for growth within the community. The facility offers such potential that it amazes me that those opposite would want to question its future in the region. I am looking forward to the commencement of construction at the Scottsdale DSTO and to the positives and the opportunities it will bring to this wonderful region of north-east Tasmania and the great electorate of Bass.
