        , the SAS was established to operate and strike deep behind enemy lines. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_SAS" rel="nofollow">
         Australian SAS
        </a>
        was established in 1957 and remains at the leading edge of Australia's military capabilities. Our SAS have also led the way in leveraging the talents of women. My own wife's first posting as an intelligence officer was to the SAS. I also served at the regiment as a reservist until I began my service in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inquiry by the Inspector-General of the ADF into potential breaches of the laws of armed conflict in Afghanistan is an appropriate response to the related allegations. We can be thankful that current and former SAS members are being treated with the utmost fairness and care throughout the se processes. A range of support services are available to serving and former ADF members, and their families, and I encourage anyone who requires them to take up those services. A cultural review independent of the ADF inspector -general's review is also under way at the unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time , I implore all parliamentarians and all Australians to remain in solidarity with the purpose and the people of this incredible unit. At this time of complex geostrategic competition, it is critical that we can continue to draw upon the unique capabilities and effects of the SAS regiment who have kept us safe , have protected our national interest and must do so into our uncertain future.
