       <p>
        Over the past fortnight, I've had the great pleasure to visit many of the Rural Fire Service brigades around my electorate for their annual general meetings. I would like to congratulate all the brigade captains, the secretaries and all others that stood for office and were successful in those elections. I'd also like to congratulate Andrew Pinfold and Scott Deller from the head office at Heathcote for the great work that they have done in organising everything.

        brigade will very soon be moving into their new facilities that have been built at Sandy Point. They are long overdue, but are great new facilities that will really help make a difference in that particular area.

        I'd also like to again congratulate the Rural Fire Service in my region for their work during the recent bushfires back in April across the

        area as well. It was truly remarkable that we had that much fire activity, that many acres burnt and such significant winds yet the only asset lost was one children's cubby house. It was a remarkable achievement, and it was only a remarkable achievement because of the years of, and dedication to, training of those volunteers in my area and their hard work and determination to keep our area safe. Again, I congratulate all those involved in the
