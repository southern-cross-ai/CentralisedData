       <p>
        I rise today to speak about the National Youth Week celebrations in my electorate. National Youth Week is celebrated each year in Macarthur to recognise the positive contributions made by young people to our community. National Youth Week also gives young people the opportunity to connect with each other by taking part in activities, events, workshops and forums. In the Camden area, 25 different activities and events were organised for young people. These activities included: an art exhibition, gaming workshops, movie and pizza nights, mechanical bull rides, a dance party, youth forum and much more.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year I attended the Regional Youth Forum, organised by youth advisory groups from all over Macarthur. The forum gave young people the opportunity to share their ideas with the leaders of our community. It was a fantastic opportunity for young people to have their voices heard and make a difference for the young people living in Macarthur.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very impressed by all of the contributions made by young people at the forum. Today I would like to encourage them to keep up the great work and enthusiasm representing their peers. I would also like to commend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Council" rel="nofollow">

        and its youth council,

        and its youth council, and all of Macarthur's youth services for their dedication to the young people in my community. This year's National Youth Week celebrations were a fantastic example of my community working together to support our young people. I am proud to say that, after attending this year's youth week events, I am confident that the future of Macarthur is in very good hands.
