        Many significant milestones have been acknowledged in this place. I would like to add one more, and congratulate Fay and

        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Harbor" rel="nofollow">
         Victor Harbor
        </a>
        , in my community, on their upcoming 70th wedding anniversary on 3 April, which is next week. My office has sent set out congratulatory letters for many 50th anniversaries, and even a few 60ths, but this is the first 70th anniversary to come across my desk. So, when I was in Victor Harbor last week, I dropped around and visited Jack and Fay to offer my congratulations in person. It was wonderful to see a couple so in love, and you could be forgiven for thinking they were honeymooners. I asked them what the secret was to a happy marriage and it was no surprise to learn that the secret was communication. Jack was one of eight children, and he told me he could never remember his parents having an argument. When he got married his father took him aside and told him that if he wanted a happy life, not to argue. He urged the couple to talk things out: never to go to bed if they had a difference but to sit down and talk it out, even in the wee small hours. Jack and Fay took his advice and they have never had an argument. They've had their differences but they've talked it out. I think this is good advice for all of us, and I again congratulate Jack and Fay on 70 wonderful years of marriage, and for the wonderful family, of many generations, that they have created together. Congratulations, Jack and Fay Miller.
