        A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending the Mount Druitt Netball Association representative dinner, where we celebrated the achievements of the year. On the night, I also had the chance to catch up with Margaret Weir, Secretary of the Tregear Presbyterian Netball Club, who over the years has inspired a lot of sporting starsâ€”and I say thank you to Margaret for her hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the people Margaret is associated with and we'd be familiar with is her grandson, Mat Ryan. From Shalvey Primary School student to Socceroo shot stopper, Mat is the true definition of a

        , grew up in Western Sydney and has worn the Socceroos No. 1 jersey. He had his first 2014 World Cup experience under his belt at the age of just 22 and was Australia's first-choice goalkeeper for this year's World Cup in Russia. He's starring in the European league and played with a number of clubs. I want to say how proud we are of his achievements and we'll be watching, with great interest, where his career heads.
