       <p>
        There are two cities in my electorate of Solomon: of course, Darwin, the northern capital of Australia, and also Palmerston, which I'm very happy and honoured to share with the honourable member for Lingiari. But I am the local member for the majority of Palmerston, and that's why I am very pleased that in recent weeks the Palmerston hospital celebrated its first birthday. A lot of us worked for many years to see that hospital built.

        I was very pleased also that, on the first anniversary, the

        government for the new Palmerston Police Station, which will mean that police officers in Palmerston can spend more time out in the community, on the beat. Added to this, there's going to be a new fire station for Palmerston because the old one is well past its use-by date. Congratulations to Tony Sievers, the member for Brennan, and to Eva Lawler, the local member for Drysdale, on their fantastic work for the community of Palmerston.
