          I thank the member for his question. This is a question in a series that have been asked by the honourable member which is trying to draw some equivalence between nuclear-powered submarines and a civil nuclear industry. The short answer to the honourable member's question is that it will be safe to serve on a nuclear-powered submarine. But, whilst those opposite are trying to have some culture war between nuclear and non-nuclear, at the end of the day this is about economics, because what they are seeking to do is economically insane. To draw an equivalence between eight nuclear reactors which will power eight single machines and nuclear reactors, which those opposite are proposing, which are meant to be powering cities—

           The Deputy Prime Minister will pause. Member for Canning, I'm going to give you some free advice, if I may. The Deputy Prime Minister has answered the question. He's remaining on topic about the issue. It is going to be difficult to raise a point of order on relevance.

            To try and draw an equivalence between eight sealed nuclear reactors, which will be powering eight single machines, and civil nuclear reactors which those opposite are proposing, which are intended to power cities, is like drawing a comparison between a car engine and a coal-fired power station because they both burn hydrocarbons. The two instruments could not be more different. Those opposite are talking about using the nuclear waste facility that will be developed for AUKUS when the first of those reactors is not due to go out of service—will not need to be disposed of—until the early 2050s. Those opposite are trying to say that we should be heading towards zero net emissions by 2050. The reality is that their civil nuclear power stations will be generating tonnes of—

                  They've made their announcement on a nuclear power industry, and on day 1 of question time they no longer want to talk about it. That is where they have got to with their policy. You want to raise the question about safety? The entirety of the nuclear cycle forms part of the question of safety, so it is directly relevant in terms of the question that was asked by the honourable member. The fact of the matter is that we will not need to be disposing of a nuclear reactor until the early 2050s. They are proposing a nuclear industry which will be generating tonnes of high-level nuclear waste well before that if they want to make any impact for zero net emissions by 2050.

                  You can talk about a culture war between nuclear or non-nuclear. At the end of the day, the critical issue here is that what they are proposing is economic insanity. At a time when we have high energy bills, they are pursuing the single highest priced source of energy on the planet, and they are unable to tell us how much it will cost, when it will come to pass or even how much power it will produce.
