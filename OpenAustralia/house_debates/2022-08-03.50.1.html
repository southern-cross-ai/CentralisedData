        I rise to update the House on a great milestone at the Magill Village Project, which I was thrilled to secure $2 million of funding towardsâ€”a partnership between the previous coalition government and two local councils, Campbelltown and Burnside. This project is going to be a great outcome for the precinct of Magill Road. There has been some short-term pain for long-term gain for traders along there, and I thank them so much for their patience. We have had to close footpaths as we've worked through the process of kerbing and paving and burying powerlines. That has caused some short-term disruption to the traders, but they are 100 per cent behind this project, because the long-term outcome for them is going to be absolutely fantastic. We are now at the stage where all of that work is done, and now in the heart section of the precinct we're about to get to that final exciting stage of laying the top level of asphalt along the road and opening it up completely to the public.

        It's going to be an excellent outcome for the families in the area and businesses in the area. For those lucky enough to live in Magill and the surrounding areas, it's going to be a lovely place to go get a cup of coffee and spend your leisurely weekends. I really thank everyone at the Campbelltown and Burnside councils for their work on this project. The community is already in love with it. It's only going to be better when it's finished, and I'm thrilled to have been able to secure funding to make it happen.
