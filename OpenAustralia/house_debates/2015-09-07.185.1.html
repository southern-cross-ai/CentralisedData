        Recently I had the pleasure of attending a morning assembly at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bligh_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bligh Park
        </a>
        Public School, where I presented them with an Anzac Day Schools' Award, a $500 cheque and a plaque. Due to the phenomenal effort of staff and students, Bligh Park was awarded runner up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        primary schools category, for their beautifully presented, creative and informative entry to commemorate 100 years since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . It was wonderful to see young children from kindergarten to year 6 involved in bringing the Anzac tradition to life. I give special mention to school principal Joan Westerweller and librarian Linda Ferris for developing and guiding an idea for the entry in the federal government's competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        All staff gave their students the opportunity to learn about and reflect on World War I in a creative and engaging way. Each Anzac Day, Bligh Park Public School put a lot of effort into hosting a ceremony and taking part in related activities in the weeks leading up to it. Hands-on learning is encouraged, and servicemen and servicewomen visit the school to share their experience with the children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured to attend the Anzac ceremony held at the school this year. I was also given the opportunity to have a tour through the school's entry into Anzac Day Schools' Award. The students created a trench in their Anzac Learning Centre, where they taped cardboard boxes to the floor and smeared them with mud to make the trenches look real; sandbags were also filled and hauled to the centre. The students also built an honour board, and after research, plaques explaining the names of Hawkesbury First World Ward servicemen and women were added. The board is now displayed with pride in the school foyer.
