        Today I stand to condemn the recent push through the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        ESCO, for removing Jewish ties to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount" rel="nofollow">
         Temple Mount
        </a>
        complex. This comes after a vote on 26 October, where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
         UNESCO
        </a>
        voted to refer to Jerusalem holy sites by only their Muslim names, through its resolution on occupied Palestine. This is not acceptable. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rightly slammed the vote, stating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The theatre of the absurd continues at the UN … denying the Jewish people's connection to the Temple Mount, our holiest site for more than 3,000 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To say Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount is like saying that China has no connection to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Wall
        </a>
        of China or Egypt has no connection to the pyramids … But I believe the historical truth is stronger and that truth will prevail. And today we are dealing with the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to state on record today that I believe strongly in the statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu and that that is the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Religious freedom must always be accommodated in the rights and freedoms of all, but we must recognise the freedom of the Jewish people should be respected, including proper respect for their faith, culture and cultural ties to significant and important sites. This resolution segregates the Jewish people further. It is utterly shameful. Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States have made it known to the world that they are prepared to stand up for religious freedom and for the enduring connections of the Jewish people to Temple Mount—and so should we. This decision to dishonour and disrespect the enduring connection of Jewish people to the Temple Mount makes a mockery and undermines some of the fundamental principles that this country should stand for.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a much broader context, I am concerned about some of the trends we are now seeing. According to reports in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        today, it has been alleged by Israeli authorities that our government has indirectly and unintentionally been one of the biggest funders of the Hamas terrorist organisation in Gaza over the past seven years, through World Vision Gaza.
       </p>
       <p>
        The head of World Vision Gaza has been charged in August for funnelling money, and subsequently World Vision Gaza has suspended operations. I think that it is very important for all of us to make it clear that this is inappropriate and we expect an immediate investigation so that no Australian tax dollars are used to promote terrorism against the Jewish people of Israel as well as the Palestinian people, as so often the governments in those regions have sought to do. This is an opportunity for us to stand up for our values in the international sphere and continue to recognise the enduring connection of the Jewish people to Temple Mount and also ensure that our tax dollars will never go towards promoting terrorism. I am sure all members would agree with me on these sentiments.
