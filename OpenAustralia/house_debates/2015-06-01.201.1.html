        I regret to inform the House of the passing last fortnight of Eric Nobbs, a well-known pastoralist, who was born in Jandowae but lived most of his life in my electorate. Eric was regarded by all who knew him as a gentleman and a gentle man. He was unassuming, and he was successful in the cattle industry. Throughout his career, he built his family business to include 17 highly productive properties in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He lived to 97, but even in his later years he showed no interest in retirement. He kept a hands-on role in his family businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric was made a life member of the Australian Brahman Breeders Association in 2002 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the Brahman breed. His cattle have achieved great results across Australia, and he was judged the most successful breeder at the Brahman Commercial Breeding Female Sale in 2012 and 2013. Eric was a regular Beef Australia entrant and made an appearance at the last Beef Week, which was held in Rockhampton only last month. There was no shortage of well-wishers. Eric Nobbs's passing represents a great loss to the Queensland and Australian cattle industry. My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.
