        My question is to the Prime Minister. At the last election, Australians sent a strong message that they wanted action to get wages moving, to get more Australians skills and training and to tackle the rising cost-of-living. How is the Albanese Labor government's first budget cleaning up the mess that the government inherited and delivering on what Australians voted for?

         I thank the member for Bruce for his question about the budget, on budget day. Those opposite wasted a decade, but we are not wasting a day, and in tonight's budget you will see being delivered what Australians voted for: cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, paid parental leave, more affordable housing, fee-free

         —a responsible budget right for the times and ready for the future. These reforms take pressure off family budgets without adding to inflation. Australians have been waiting for a responsible, reforming budget for a decade and tonight they will see one.
        </p>
        <p>
         After nine years of those opposite deliberately keeping wages low, we're getting wages moving again. You'll see some more action on that at the end of the week. After nine years of division and denial and dysfunction on energy policy, we're lifting Australia's ambitions on climate change and we're investing in renewable energy. After nine years of telling Australia's manufacturers to leave the country, we want a future made in Australia and we'll support manufacturers in this country. After nine years of shameful neglect in aged care, we're taking action to fix the crisis. After nine years of sordid scandals from those opposite, we're going to have the National Anti-Corruption Commission funded in this budget. After nine years, we're also working to bring Australians together. That's why we did the Jobs and Skills Summit—to move towards having solutions, not look towards just having arguments. Those opposite were obsessed by conflict, trying to divide people. They acted like an opposition in exile while they were on the government benches, and now what's very clear is that they've learnt absolutely nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just before question time we were dealing with the childcare legislation, and those opposite are just beside themselves, saying we weren't listening. They attacked it the whole way through, and then they said, 'Oh, but maybe we won't oppose it.' Well, they should get out of the way, because what you'll see from tonight's budget is a responsible budget that takes pressure off the cost of living and is family friendly without putting pressure on inflation.

          Order! There is far too much noise on my left and right. I'm going to give the call to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I ask for her to be heard in silence.
