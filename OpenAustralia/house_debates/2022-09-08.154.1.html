        Lugarno Football Club is a mighty institution in our electorate, and on Saturday 23 July it was great to attend its 60th anniversary dinner at the Conca D'Oro in Riverwood. Established way back in 1962, it is one of the biggest clubs anywhere in the St George region, with well over 500 players, from under-sixes to over-45s. It is great to see an increasing number of women and girls participating in the Lugarno football club every year. That number continues to grow. In particular, it was great to acknowledge Sue Dick on the night. She really personifies everything that is great about Lugarno

        . It was also great to see Michael Jarevski, the president, and so many other members of the executive and families who have an association with the club. Lugarno FC, congratulations on a great 60 years.

        On 2 September I caught up with the Revesby Rhinos at their home ground down at Neptune Park in

        . It's a beautiful spot and a great home ground for the club. The club has grown significantly in recent years. There are now 10 teams, all performing well, with three making the finals this year. Recently the club received a $7,500 grant through the Stronger Communities Program, which I was very pleased to be able to assist with. That's gone into purchasing a second-hand copy machine, additional storage, a freezer and an

         Sandra McDonald
        </a>
        , the very energetic junior secretary of the club, and talk a bit about some of the issues down at Carss Park. The reality is that the field is not in good enough condition. There are a whole range of problems with the pitch and with the playing field generally, and it is important that Georges River Council take action to address those problems, because this is a wonderful club with close to 200 players and they deserve to play in good conditions. They have a beautiful location, but the field does not match the location at the moment. So that needs to be fixed, and I look forward to continuing to work with Sandra and the club. I thank and congratulate the club for all of its work supporting young cricket players in the region.

        Catholic Primary School is a wonderful school, and on 17 August I attended their science fair. It had been postponed for a couple of years because of COVID, because you couldn't really have those sorts of events, so it was really terrific to visit the science fair on 17 August. The theme was real-world water problems impacting our environment. The kids did some really interesting and thought-provoking displays about environmental issues, including the importance of conserving and protecting water and ensuring that it is there not just today but in the decades and centuries to come. It was really terrific to visit. The St Christopher's community is a special one, and it was great to go down there. I'd like to acknowledge Warren Loy, the principal; Brooke Watson, the assistant principal; and Charlotte Garner, a teacher who had a huge role in organising what was a very successful event.

        Lily Monteverdi School of Music has a proud history of providing music to our community. The school specialises in violin, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, piano and guitar, and it teaches students to a very high standard. There's an annual concert. It's been at the

        this year. It really reflects the stature of Lily Monteverdi, a terrific local group with more than 200 people, mainly kids, who are learning the beauty of music through their instructors at Lily Monteverdi. I'd like to thank Lily Su, the head teacher and director; Monty Guo and Verdy Guo, who are also heavily involved in the school; and everyone who's involved in Lily Monteverdi.
