        It is the last sitting week before Easter. Many take time off over Easter, but not in Bendigo. Bendigo actually has the longest continuous Easter festival in our country. Since the 1890s, we have always had an imperial Chinese dragon involved in the main event of our Easter festival, the Gala Parade. First it was Loong, who was first involved in the Easter festival in the 1890s. Loong is so well regarded that he was actually involved in Federation. He is one of the only artefacts remaining of Federation and the birth of this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Loong became old he was replaced with Sun Loong. With the assistance of Qantas in the 1960s, Sun Loong, made in

        </a>
        by dragon experts, was flown to Australia. He has participated in every Easter festival since. Now, Sun Loong is too old and needs to retire by 2018. So the Bendigo community, the Bendigo Chinese Association and the

        </a>
        have kickstarted a campaign asking people to donate towards the purchase of Dai Gum Loong, the third dragon that we hope to have in Bendigo since the 1890s.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an opportunity for the Federal government to get on board and help Bendigo purchase its third dragon. This long legacy of Chinese dragons needs to continue.
