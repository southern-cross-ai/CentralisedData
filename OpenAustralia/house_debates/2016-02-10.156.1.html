       <p>
        Fishing is an important part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n and also the Australian way of life, and recreational fishing is a strong economic driver, with more than 277,000 men, women and children engaging in recreational fishing in South Australia each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of this, South Australia is a destination for anglers, with large numbers of interstate and international visitors enjoying recreational fishing on our seas, rivers and estuaries. However, recreational anglers in South Australia are facing hefty cuts in bag and boat limits for popular fish species, such as our famous

        </a>
        state Labor government proposals.
       </p>
       <p>
        New fisheries management measures have been plagued by Labor in South Australia and are currently open for consultation and feedback, creating an emotional debate in my state. I wish to raise a number of concerns, as I fear the proposed measures will mean that all the anglers in South Australia are big losers. Family friends, like the Bastian family, are one of many families in my state who have contacted me about this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the proposed changes, some of the species face bag limit cuts of up to one-third—a double whammy of a higher minimum size limit and maximum size limit, and the possibility of seasonal closure. The state government has a poor record in handling fisheries and marine issues. They bungled the recent changes announced for snapper season in boat limits and bag limits, and the handling of the marine parks matter was less than desirable.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I understand that necessary measures need to be put in place to protect fish stocks for future generations, I am afraid that there will be impacts on local businesses and the South Australian tourism sector—in particular, those tourism-reliant businesses in Hindmarsh—if these changes are implemented in full. Hindmarsh borders the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Saint_Vincent" rel="nofollow">
         Gulf of Saint Vincent
        </a>
        and has some of Adelaide's best metropolitan beaches. It is home to a major boat ramp in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        , and the Glenelg, Henley and Grange jetties are used by local fishermen and women for their angling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is important in my electorate, and I am always interested in how we can promote our state—and this is part of the puzzle. I am fearful that the proposed changes will have an adverse impact on those businesses that benefit from the tourism dollars spent by people fishing, such as the local cafes, bakeries, coffee shops, petrol stations, boat service stations and mechanics et cetera—not to mention the award-winning West Beach Caravan Park where, for generations, families have spent their summer holidays, with many enjoying the fishing that the Gulf of St Vincent has to offer.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are more than 18,000 tourism businesses in South Australia, most of which are small businesses employing fewer than five employees. We need to support these businesses, not make life more challenging and difficult. I am convinced that this will greatly impact on interstate and international arrivals—people coming from afar to enjoy the beaches. The state government must take a very serious consultative approach to this, rather than the announce-and-defend approach they are renowned for. I am confident that the people's views will be heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate the South Australian Anglers' Association on their involvement in this important issue on behalf of the members. I encourage people to attend an event on 24 February at Glenelg Comfort Inn Haven Marina.
