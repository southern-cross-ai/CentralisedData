        I rise to speak about my visit yesterday to the Hope Valley Bowling and Community Club. I visited the club because they invited me to join them in the opening of their 2008-09 season. Whilst I was at the bowling club they showed me the work they have undertaken to ensure that all of the water which falls on the greens, the buildings and the car park is collected and then reused by the club. The work that has been carried out is very, very extensive. Indeed, it is a credit to the board of management of the Hope Valley Bowling and Community Club because, unlike too many others in the community who spend an incredible amount of time talking about the need to conserve water and reuse rainwater, this is a club that has actually done what needs to be done. They did it with the assistance of the federal government and a grant for $47,000 or $48,000, which certainly helped. The local council, the Tea Tree Gully Council, equally assisted. What is incredible about this project is that no water will leave the premises—and it is a fairly large site. This gives the club the ability to collect up to 170,000 litres of water at any one time. Obviously, as they use it, they will replenish it with water that they collect. It is a credit to them and it is a model that I believe other organisations ought to be following. (
