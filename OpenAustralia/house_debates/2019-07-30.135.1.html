       <p>
        Having delivered my maiden speech last night, it is now a pleasure to deliver my first constituency statement to the Federation Chamber. The Morrison government understands the needs of families and businesses in Stirling, and is getting on with the job of delivering for all Australians. I want to focus my attention today on the projects and commitments that I have made to the people of Stirling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, there's our commitment to our coastline with $4 million being invested in Surfing WA to upgrade their Trigg headquarters; $20,000 for Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club upgrades; and $20,000 for Stirling Natural Environment Coastcare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, we're committed to local sporting facility upgrades, with $500,000 going to the Coolbinia Bombers Junior Football Club to install lights, which will mean that those kids will enjoy significantly more field time. There is $455,000 for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_Lions" rel="nofollow">
         Stirling Lions
        </a>
        sports club to install new lights, as well as renovate the clubhouse and the kitchen; $300,000 towards a new clubhouse for the Carine Cats; and $180,000 to renovate a green at the Yokine Districts Bowling Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really passionate about supporting those sporting, religious and community groups which form the beating hearts of our communities. The Morrison government is also committed to local cultural, religious and community hubs, with $300,000 promised to the Jewish community centre in Dianella, $85,000 for the Mirrabooka mosque to fund security upgrades, $20,000 for the Wadjak Northside Aboriginal Community Group centre, $15,000 for defibrillators across the city of Stirling to make community centres safer, and $8,000 of facilities upgrades at the Macedonian Cultural Centre. Approximately $6 million is going to intersection upgrades to get people home more safely and quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government was returned because people, like those I represent in Stirling, understand that we are fighting for them. They know that we are on their side and are delivering the projects and outcomes that will make our local community a better place to live, work and raise a family. I look forward to working with my colleagues and constituents to deliver these important projects for Stirling.
