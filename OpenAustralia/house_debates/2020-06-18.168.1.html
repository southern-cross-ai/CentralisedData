        Volunteers have a strong presence throughout the Moncrieff electorate. Whether it's helping out with local sporting teams, responding to natural disasters and emergencies, or helping local charities support some of our most disadvantaged people, the most important of volunteers have never been more relevant than now as we work to meet the challenges presented by COVID-19. I commend the Morrison government's Volunteer Grants program, which recognises the valuable role volunteers play in building more resilient and cohesive communities, and supporting individual participation in community life. It supports the efforts of volunteers who are the backbone of our community. I'd like to highlight the projects that are taking in place and around Moncrieff.

        Hungarian Association will both update their refrigerators so they can continue to host their wonderful community events. Broadbeach Meals on Wheels, Queensland Professional Athletics Club, and Gold Coast Disability Advocacy will receive funding to assist their volunteers with their transportation costs.

        training. Gold Coast City Brass Band, one of my favourites, will build a percussion section and purchase more instruments. The Gold Coast Philharmonic Society will also enhance their musical capabilities by improving the mobility of their orchestra. Presence Church in Surfers Paradise will purchase a projector screen and microphone to facilitate volunteer training sessions. St John's Crisis Centre will train more volunteers. Rosie's Youth Mission will increase their volunteer capacity with background screening checks. Both organisations do an incredible job helping the homeless and around Moncrieff, which is so critical during this time. The Vietnam Veterans Federation, which I'll make special mention of, will purchase more safety equipment such as high-vis vests, a resuscitator kit and safety glasses for their Men's Shed in Nerang. I've been there a couple of times and bought all the honey they produce at the Nerang Men's Shed. I enjoy my trips out there to their organisation.

        I'd like to extend my congratulations to all the successful organisations and thank them for the work that they do on the Gold Coast for our community. It's a very difficult time for very many Gold Coasters, and these community organisations are there helping those that need the extra help. Again I shout out to those at St John's Crisis Centre and Di Kozic. You're doing a great job. Keep up the good work. Thank you for helping our city.
