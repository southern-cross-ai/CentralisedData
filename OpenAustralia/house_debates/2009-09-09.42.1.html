        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
         Social Inclusion
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to an estimate from Abigroup of $2.9 million for work on six classrooms in the

         I thank the member for his question. As the member may be aware, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         program, with more than 24,000 projects around the country at around 9,500 schools, is there to support jobs today whilst building the school infrastructure we need for tomorrow. He has drawn to my attention in this parliament two quotes he says he is familiar with from two schools for identical projects. Obviously I do not have with me sitting here in this parliament the project specifications and designs of the more than 24,000 projects authorised under this program. However, if he believes that there is a problem with the provision of tenders and quotes in relation to any school then obviously we want to hear about that. If any school has raised an issue with him and he wishes to raise it directly with me, I am very happy for that to happen. If the school community wants to raise it then the school community can raise it, as I have said, through the email address at my website.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have said, during the life of a program that has more than 24,000 projects at around 9,500 schools we have received 49 complaints. When those complaints are received, obviously we work to address them. If the member has information that he believes it is important for the government to have, particularly when it relates to something as detailed as whether or not the actual building projects are identical, which he claims—and I am not dismissing what the member says, but obviously I would want to see the building plans and the full details—I would be more than happy to work it through with him.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is a longstanding practice that, when a minister is unable for good reason to answer a question, they promise the House they will come back with the detail. I request you ask the minister to follow that practice.
