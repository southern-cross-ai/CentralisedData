        Each and every day we are a government proudly fighting for jobs and growth. The deceptive and racist campaign being run by the unions and Labor against the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or ChAFTA, is putting at risk thousands of new jobs and agricultural exports. It is estimated that over the next 20 years the ChAFTA will deliver some 178,000 new jobs. In Corangamite, a proud farming heartland, the Labor candidate is working hand in glove with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        's dishonest campaign to destroy one of the most significant trade deals in a generation. If ChAFTA does not go ahead, it will rob farmers of millions of dollars in export income.
       </p>

        Between 2008 and 2013,

        </a>
        free trade agreement with China delivered increased dairy export revenue of $3.7 billion. In the same period Australian dairy farmers received an increase of only $173 million. Meat and Livestock Australia and the Australian Meat Industry Council, representing processors, say that the ChAFTA has the potential to increase the gross value of beef production by $270 million annually by 2024. By 2030, the total benefits for beef will approach $3.3 billion. Under the ChAFTA, dairy tariffs will be abolished and Australia's beef and sheep farmers will also have great benefits. This free trade agreement is vital for Australian farmers and for Australian jobs.

         It is interesting to hear members opposite talk about the China free trade agreement. It is an important agreement and it is an important agreement for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . The China relationship, in commercial terms, is a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         relationship. We are the ones with the opportunity to underpin the export future of our nation through what we do with our iron ore, our bauxite, our alumina, our grain crops and our protein exports through seafood, beef, cattle and sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
         The interesting thing about the China free trade agreement is that the government cannot help but wrap it up with all the strings of politics as often as it possibly can. We on this side want to support this agreement; members on that side need to understand community concern about the impact on people movement that comes through this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am the person—single in this place—who stood in favour of overseas workers supporting the construction side of our resources sector at a time when it was harder than anything that members opposite have ever faced. All members opposite can do is try to wrap up this important free trade agreement with every string that they can find attached to people movements, when we in this parliament should be arguing for this free trade agreement. It is fundamentally about Western Australia, about Western Australian jobs and about Western Australia's future—and members opposite should get behind it for the nature of the reforms that it represents and the beneficial impact it will have on the jobs and the employment of the future in Western Australia.
