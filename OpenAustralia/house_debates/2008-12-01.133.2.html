       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina from 29 September to 8 October 2008. In presenting this report may I observe that this particular delegation was led by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        and the report has been tabled by him in another place. For this visit, I was accompanied by my colleague the member for Hindmarsh,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Georganas" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Georganas
        </a>
        , who will speak later, as well as a number of senators accompanying the President: Senators Steve Fielding,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Furner" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Furner
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Hurley" rel="nofollow">
         Annette Hurley
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
         Barnaby Joyce
        </a>
        . I might say they were excellent company. In that sense, not only was the visit very successful but one where there was a good opportunity to learn a great deal about the area and better understand it and some of the tragedies that can befall some parts of the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was not the first visit I had made to the region—I had visited as a minister in 1997—but this visit certainly provided an important opportunity for the Australian parliament to renew and develop its contacts with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_President" rel="nofollow">
         Croatian President
        </a>
        , the Prime Minister, the parliament itself and local Croatian authorities. It gave a better understanding of what they have endured and a better appreciation of what they are seeking to do in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Croatia has entered a period where accession to the European Union and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
        </a>
        has started. These are very important developments that will help with its postwar economic development and social progress. We had an opportunity to travel and meet with important representatives in such places as Vukovar, Split and Dubrovnik, and we were able to have a good understanding of their aspirations for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, our visit coincided with the disappearance of a young Australian backpacker, Britt Lapthorne. The leader of the delegation was briefed on the situation upon arrival in Croatia by our ambassador and attended a number of meetings with the Croatian Minister for the Interior and police authorities, and the Lapthorne family met with us. I attended a memorial service for Britt in Melbourne along with our friend the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        and also Senator Steve Fielding. We bonded very much with the family—we understood their agony. The Australian Ambassador was able to represent our Australian views, but I think the President had a good understanding of the needs of the family and worked hard to ensure that there was a good understanding that everything was being done that could possibly be done to assist.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were, of course, the first parliamentary delegation to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We had constructive discussions with major political figures and leaders of interreligious bodies. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" rel="nofollow">
         Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina
        </a>
        , the body dealing with war crimes, has amongst its membership an Australian judge, David Re. We experienced much of the history and geography of the area. We had a trip to Mostar, in which we were able to visit the Centre for Children and Youth for those with special needs. This is a project that Australia has been helping with.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a particularly useful visit to understand the way in which they want to move forward. I would like to be able elaborate greatly on it, but I see the time is fast disappearing. My colleagues were good company and we were well served by our ambassadors, Her Excellency Tracy Reid, Australian Ambassador to Croatia, and His Excellency Peter Shannon, Australian Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We were aided by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Clifford" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Clifford
        </a>
        and also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Reid" rel="nofollow">
         Christopher Reid
        </a>
        , who helped to ensure that the delegation functioned well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The President expressed our thanks to the Parliamentary Library for their briefings, the Parliamentary Relations Office and also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRG" rel="nofollow">
         HRG
        </a>
        travel for their assistance and, like me, offered thanks to delegates for making it such a constructive visit.

         I too rise to speak on the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to add to the remarks of my colleague opposite, the member for Berowra, and say how privileged I was to be part of this delegation. It was my very first official delegation representing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament of Australia
         </a>
         . The delegation visited Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina from 29 September to 8 October 2008. The visit provided an opportunity for the Australian parliament to renew and develop contacts with the Croatian parliament. We also met with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_President" rel="nofollow">
          Croatian President
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Croatia" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister of Croatia
         </a>
         and many local Croatian authorities. We travelled throughout the country and we gained a good understanding of Croatia’s priorities—where they are, where they want to be. Other features of the delegation’s work in Croatia included a meeting with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         agencies in Zagreb. We also met with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          European Commission
         </a>
         , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and representatives in Zagreb, as well as making visits to Vukovar, Split and Dubrovnik.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delegation visited Bosnia and Herzegovina from 5 October to 8 October 2008. As the member for Berowra said, it was the very first official parliamentary delegation to visit Bosnia. The delegation established contact at an official level and quickly came to appreciate the very complex culture and economic situation faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina. The delegation has commenced a relationship that may realise successful bilateral exchanges in times to come. We met many interesting people—officials and politicians—and all of these people expressed how they had gone through a terrible situation in the early nineties but how they have left all that behind and are trying to make their lives far more fruitful to ensure that they can get on with their lives peacefully in a unified way. One of their aspirations is to join the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         , so we heard all about the EU and what they are trying to achieve. Certain criteria have been set up for them to achieve and they are working very hard towards achieving those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delegation expresses its sincere thanks to those involved in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for making the visit such a beneficial and memorable one. The delegation recorded its appreciation in the report to its Croatian hosts and the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina and related bodies for the hospitality and the courtesy extended to us during our visit. I also join the member for Berowra in thanking my fellow members of the delegation: the leader, the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hogg" rel="nofollow">
          John Hogg
         </a>
         , and the deputy leader, the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ruddock" rel="nofollow">
          Philip Ruddock
         </a>
         , who both did a sterling job in representing the delegation and the Australian parliament. Also with us on the delegation were Senator Steve Fielding, Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Furner" rel="nofollow">
          Mark Furner
         </a>
         , Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Hurley" rel="nofollow">
          Annette Hurley
         </a>
         and Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
          Barnaby Joyce
         </a>
         and their spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the secretary to the delegation, Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Reid" rel="nofollow">
          Christopher Reid
         </a>
         , who did an outstanding job, and the adviser to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          President of the Senate
         </a>
         , Ms
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Clifford" rel="nofollow">
          Julia Clifford
         </a>
         , for their cooperation and support and their preparation and hard work during the trip, which ensured that everything went smoothly. I would also like to record my thanks to the Parliamentary Relations Office, in particular, to Andrew Templeton for his administrative assistance prior to our departure from Australia and, as was mentioned earlier, to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRG" rel="nofollow">
          HRG
         </a>
         travel staff for assisting with the travel itineraries. We had excellent support. It was provided in an excellent manner throughout the delegation’s visit. The Australian Ambassador to Croatia, Tracey Reid, was fantastic and so was the Australian Ambassador to Austria, who ensured that our stay in the countries of Bosnia and Croatia went smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was very unfortunate that Britt Lapthorne disappeared. The tragedy had taken place before we got there, but we did meet with her parents and with Croatian authorities to discuss the issue. It was a very sad occurrence. Unlike other members, I was unable to go to the memorial but, certainly, if I had been in Melbourne, I would have attended. I would like to thank all those involved.
