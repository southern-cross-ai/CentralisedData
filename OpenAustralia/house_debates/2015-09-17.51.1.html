        's. This weekend we were going to launch in Bendigo our Save Local Jobs campaign, and we had done all the preparation of material. In this material, we were calling on the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the Liberal government to do more to save local jobs. We were calling on the government to sign the Hawkei contract to lock in defence manufacturing jobs. We were calling on this government to reverse its big cuts to health, education and community services and to restore jobs in those sectors.
