        This year has been a very significant one for Australia. Earlier this year our nation came together to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings and the forging of the Anzac spirit. But this year was also the year that we commemorated 40 years since the end of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">

        . This week my community once again came together, this time to acknowledge the 49th anniversary of the

         The Battle

        of Long Tan represents Australia's first major engagement in the Vietnam War. It was one of the most difficult and courageous battles ever fought by Australian soldiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a rubber plantation on a rainy afternoon on 18 August 1966 an engagement started as an ambush on an Australian force comprising 108 men by an approximately 2½ thousand-strong Vietcong and

        contingent. Confronted with the equivalent of almost two battalions,

        6RAR, under the command of then Major Harry Smith, demonstrated acts of sheer courage, determination and mateship—acts which have come to typify the spirit of Anzac.
       </p>
       <p>
        As in 1915, on this occasion the Australians were also well supported by

        artillery. Even so, against overwhelming odds the prospect of success was dim. But they did succeed and, as a consequence, this battle takes pride of place in Australian military history. Tragically, 18 Australian soldiers were killed in the battle and 24 men were wounded. But it is to our nation's shame that our Vietnam veterans were not recognised for their courage and extraordinary service when they returned home. That took almost 20 years. Prime Minister Bob Hawke took the initiative in declaring 18 August, the day of the Battle of Long Tan, to be Vietnam Veterans Day, to recognise and honour the almost 60,000 who served in Vietnam and also to remember the 521 who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom and liberty for the people of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the memories run deep in the minds of my Vietnamese constituents. They have always held the Australian soldiers in the absolute highest regard. Our Vietnam veterans fought with great courage and determination. On the 49th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, I honour and pay respect to all those who served in the Vietnam conflict. Their significant sacrifice will never be forgotten.
