        Nick is a countertenor, which I am told is one of the rarest of voices. Nick is currently the only one at the Melbourne Conservatorium. Nick was awarded the Dorothy N Glover musical trust scholarship to help fund his higher education in Europe. International countertenor

        has offered to take Nick under his wing and coach him in Switzerland with this scholarship. Nick's mentors tell me that he is driven and he works very hard to achieve his goals. Nick is a fantastic ambassador for the great state of Tasmania and an example of the talent my state has to offer. I look forward to attending his concert in July and wish him all the very best for a brilliant career in the arts. I also thank those who have supported him on his journey, including his family, teachers and mentors.
