        I rise this morning to talk about the Council on the Ageing in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COTA" rel="nofollow">
         COTA
        </a>
        does great work advocating for a just, inclusive and equitable society for senior Territorians. That is what they state is one of their core functions. They do a great job. They are in an old building that needs some serious renovation but they do fantastic work. As we know, seniors are defined as people over 50. They have a great network of people that they visit. They are involved in round-table discussions. They hold regular meetings. They have spoken to be on a number of occasions about the great need to have their office facilities upgraded.
       </p>
       <p>
        With that, we invited them to apply for funding under the Stronger Communities Program, an initiative of this government to give electorates $150,000 grants for small capital projects. In my electorate we have a great committee that is well represented from within the community, and I am pleased to say that funding of $5,207, which will be matched by COTA, will enable them to upgrade some of their facilities. They wanted to get some new kitchen equipment and replace some lounges and bookshelves. This is going to help them do that. We are very pleased that we were able to help this wonderful not-for-profit organisation continue to do the great work that they do for seniors in Darwin and Palmerston in my electorate.
       </p>

        I would also like to talk about a lovely young lady I met when I was at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKillop" rel="nofollow">
         MacKillop
        </a>
        Catholic College in Darwin a couple of weeks ago. Claire Forsyth is a young middle school student who approached me to get some advice on how she could best equip herself to stand for a leadership role in the school. I received a couple of emails from Claire. I am really delighted with the email received last night, in which she advised me that she has been elected as the middle school captain at MacKillop college. I wish her all the best. She is an outstanding young lady and I think she will do a fantastic job as the middle school captain at MacKillop college. Well done, Claire, and well done to your fellow students for electing you.
