        We've all seen devastating floods on the eastern seaboard, but I'm here to report that water is now making its way through the Murray-Darling Basin. I've spent time in communities throughout the Riverland over the past couple of weeks, meeting with local businesses, residents and local governments who are busy preparing for the expected flows. We're currently seeing 108 gigalitres flowing into

        past lock 5. To put that in context, our annual allocation puts the rate at about seven. This is expected to increase to 175 gigalitres per day by early December and could reach as much as 220 gigalitres per day. This will be more water than you can fly a rocket ship over but also more water than we've seen in the Riverland since 1974.

        It never fails to amaze me to see the level of community support when our fellow Aussies are in need. I can say the situation right now is no different, from truck drivers donating their equipment and time, to local sand quarriers providing sand to aid the sandbagging efforts. Sadly, however, coordination at a state level has been less than remarkable, with residents reporting a lack of coordination and communication, making it very hard to plan and prepare. I also noticed the federal Minister for Emergency Management was in South Australia last week, but couldn't take the time to visit the Riverland. Government at state and federal level need to lean in and support people on the river in their time of need.
