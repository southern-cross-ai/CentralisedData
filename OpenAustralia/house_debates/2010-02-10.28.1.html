        amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Support_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Higher Education Support Act
        </a>
        2003 to implement the government’s decision to increase the loan fee from 20 per cent to 25 per cent for undergraduate courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment will implement the recommendation of the Review of Australian Higher Education to increase the loan fee for FEE-HELP for fee-paying undergraduate students to 25 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bradley review of Australian higher education’s final report noted that the implied subsidy offered through a FEE-HELP loan increases significantly with the level of debt. This means the government subsidy varies considerably by course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tuition fees for undergraduate fee-paying courses can be substantially higher than Commonwealth supported places. When the level of FEE-HELP debt rises significantly, the taxpayer funded subsidies for the loans also substantially increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        An increase in the loan fee will enable the government to recover more of the taxpayer subsidised cost of providing FEE-HELP loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even with a five per cent increase in the loan fee the conditions of the government’s FEE-HELP scheme continue to provide an extremely favourable income contingent loan for students. If students do not repay their loan, the government meets the cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FEE-HELP loan fee applies only to fee-paying domestic students enrolled in an undergraduate course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students do not have to start repaying their HELP loan until their income reaches the minimum repayment threshold of $43,152.
       </p>
       <p>
        The increase in the FEE-HELP loan fee will apply to FEE-HELP debts incurred on or after 1 July 2010 in relation to units of study whose census dates are on or after 1 July 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
