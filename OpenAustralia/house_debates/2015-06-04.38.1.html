       <p>
        I want to pay tribute today to a leader of the Tasmanian community from my electorate of Bass, who very tragically lost his life yesterday. Councillor Barry Jarvis was the Mayor of Dorset, in Tasmania's North-East. He was also the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government Association
        </a>
        of Tasmania. Barry was first elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Dorset Council
        </a>
        in 2007. Two years later he was elected as mayor and was re-elected unopposed at the most recent local government elections. He had a diverse background, having been a miner, a retailer and, most recently, ran a successful real estate agency, with branches in his home town of Bridport and in Scottsdale.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, Barry Jarvis was a strong voice for his community and a vocal advocate for the timber and forestry industry. He understood the importance of sustainable forestry and knew how the regressive policies of the past had gutted his local community, seeing many young people leave and businesses close. He was a strong opponent of the Tasmanian Forests Agreement and was delighted when it was torn up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barry Jarvis always looked forward, not back. We worked closely together to deliver the $2.5 million Blue Derby Mountain Bike Trails, which hosted the 2015 Cross-Country Marathon Championships last May. Many interstate competitors said it was the best mountain bike trail they had ever seen, combining a wonderful course and spectacular natural beauty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I express my sincere condolences to Barry Jarvis's family, his wife Terri and their friends.
