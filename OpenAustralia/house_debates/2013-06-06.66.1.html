        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, and it follows on from the question that I asked him yesterday. How have the federal government's new nation-building commitments been assisted by this week's Queensland budget?

         I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. In this year's budget, our new nation-building projects were directed towards Queensland—both Brisbane and the built-up communities and also regional Queensland. There was $718 million for the upgrade of the Gateway Motorway North, on top of the $125 million we have already put into the Gateway Motorway North project. I would have expected something in the Queensland budget, because they have had a bit to say about that project and they have had press conferences with the Leader of the Opposition. I looked for some funding in the Queensland budget and there was not one zack—nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         I then looked for some funding for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
          Ipswich Motorway
         </a>
         , where we have got $300 million on the table for the next section between Rocklea and Darra—building on the $2.6 billion we have already committed. We gave Queensland $10 million for the business case, and that is being rolled out. So I thought, 'Where will the money be?' Well, they did a bit better. We have put about $3 billion on the table for the Ipswich Motorway and they have put in $5 million—so they have done better than zero.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then I looked for any mention of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         . The Queensland government say $690 million, but $587 million is our money. Then I looked for the Cross River Rail project. There is $715 million from us—recommended by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         . Queensland asked for that amount of money and said they would match it, but there is not a dollar. So I thought, 'Well, maybe they have some alternative plan,' and indeed they do. To quote the

         plans to do this by adapting the train signals to let trains run more frequently, by removing seats and making extra standing room, and by using station platforms more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         So I thought, 'They've probably done a bit of a study,' and indeed they have. It is the Tokyo solution—putting people on the platforms and cramming them into the trains. That is their solution.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I thought, 'That will only last so long,' and indeed they have got a post-2020 measure, said a spokesperson for Minister Scott Emerson. That of course is the Indian solution!

           vision for urban public transport in this country, supported by the Leader of the Opposition. They do not have a plan for Brisbane. They looked for best practice overseas, and that is what they came up with! They say that the federal government has no right to have any input into urban public transport—
