        as a constable.

        David's policing career began in general duties and plain-clothes operations. He was an experienced field training officer. He worked in operational skills and tactics and was a laser and firearms training instructor. David was also a qualified officer in disaster management. In his last six years, he held the privileged position of crime manager of the Gympie region, where he reviewed and monitored progress of investigations, district data quality, maintenance and analysis.

        David was a dedicated police officer who served the Queensland Police Service for 25 years, with distinction. He was a humble and selfless man who gave so much of himself to his community. He was taken too soon, with multiple myeloma cancer at the age of 61. He was a good mate to many.
