        This year marks the 25th Anniversary of Landcare. In commemoration of this great milestone, Minister Hunt announced a one-off $5 million grant round, some of which I hope will be awarded to worthy projects in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, in my hometown of Katanning, the community was celebrating another auspicious 25th Anniversary, that of Landcare Centre Manager,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
         Jill Richardson
        </a>
        , who has given 25 years of dedicated service to the local Landcare movement. Beginning in 1989 as a self-proclaimed 'Landcare widow', Jill chose to join her husband Adrian, a founding member of the Katanning Land Care District Committee. Years of voluntary service keeping books and managing records led to part-time employment in 1998. Since then, Jill has covered every conceivable role within the organisation. Since 2002 she has managed the Katanning Landcare Centre and the Land Care District Committee and forged strong relationships with community based conservation groups, regional natural resource management organisations, state and federal agencies and, of course, private landholders. She has been involved in organising state and national Landcare conferences and most recently, in 2013, in the establishment of the WA Landcare Network, which she now chairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jill's passion for grassroots environmental protection and restoration has remained undiminished over the years, and her infectious enthusiasm makes her the perfect role model for the next generation of Landcare professionals. Her 25-year commitment to assisting land managers to maintain the health of their natural and agricultural environment is to be applauded and celebrated. Thank you, Jill, for your important and ongoing role in the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's precious soil, water and biodiversity assets.
