        I move:

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">

         ACT
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Department of Finance proposes to fit out the new leased premises at One Canberra Avenue, Forrest,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out works are scheduled to commence later this year, with staged practical completion scheduled from December 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the committee made a number of comments, and I agree with the committee about the need to ensure that decisions about leased accommodation make sense on a whole-of-government basis. That is why the Minister for Finance and I announced on Monday that we have a process underway to maximise the value from Commonwealth property leases in ACT by ensuring surplus vacant office space is promptly filled by agencies with similar requirements and upcoming lease expiry dates. Previously, individual agencies were responsible for managing their own large vacant leases. These leases will now be considered at a whole-of-government level to maximise the efficient use of leases across government. As the minister and I stated earlier this week, this approach has the potential to save an estimated $200 million over 10 years. This is just one of the ways in which we are working to realise savings and better value for money out of the Commonwealth's non-defence property portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do thank the Public Works Committee for its report. The committee will always be rigorous and pay careful attention to detail in every inquiry it conducts. I commend the motion to the House.
