       <p>
        I was informed last week by the secretary of the Prahran
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        that their oldest member and a constituent of mine in Higgins, Robert Callaghan, had died at the age of 100 years. Private Robert Callaghan served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        from 11 May 1943 to 1 July 1946. He served a total of 1,148 days in the 3/14 Australian Field Ambulance. Mr Callaghan really should be congratulated for the service that he gave to our country. Unfortunately, though, he experienced some great difficulty in the last six months of his life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year Mr Callaghan was the victim of crime of the lowest calibre. He fell outside his apartment and a passer-by noticed him, unlocked his premises and took the opportunity to rob him.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge and commend the efforts of those who came to his aid, in particular the people who helped him serve out the final years of his life in great dignity. Those people include Mr Wouter Spijker of the Sacred Heart Mission in Prahran; Mr Rod Coote, the President of the Prahran RSL; and Mr Noel Sanderson, the Secretary of the Prahran RSL.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the great honour of joining Mr Callaghan to celebrate his 100th birthday earlier this year. It was an occasion that was celebrated by so many.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity in the parliament to thank him for his service to our country and to commend those community organisations that do great deeds in our community.
