        On 12 December last year, Williamstown Town Hall was full, filled with nearly a thousand people for the state funeral that honoured
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Kosky" rel="nofollow">
         Lynne Kosky
        </a>
        . All the Victorian Labor family came to pay tribute—as did many others too, including the parliamentary secretary representing the Prime Minister—to this remarkable and inspirational woman and to extend our condolences to all who loved Lynne. They loved her for what she did, this true daughter of Melbourne's west. As mayor; as the saviour, amongst a few others, of the Bulldogs football team; as the member for Altona; and as a reforming minister who, amongst many other achievements, probably did more to advance the cause of education policy reform in Victoria, and perhaps in Australia, than any state minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lynne gave so much to the Labor cause, especially in relation to the representation of women. But more than what she did was who she was: as a mother, a partner, a friend and mentor for so many, including me and my wife Jill. She was a woman of many parts and many talents, who had a great life, a wonderful journey which gave so much to so many. I am pleased to pay a small tribute to it in this place, and to say that my thoughts now are with Jim, Hana and Jack, and that I will always remember Lynne Kosky. Rest in peace.
