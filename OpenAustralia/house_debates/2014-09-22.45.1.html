       <p>
        I rise today to recognise the achievements of a number of sporting clubs. Football finals are in full swing. Although my beloved
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        went down in two heartbreaking losses over the weekend—one in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        preliminary final to Hawthorn and yesterday in the South Australian Football final—they can be congratulated for their fine season. So I want to put on the record my congratulations to President David Koch,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        Keith Thomas and the many staff and supporters of the

        </a>
        for their 2014 season.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a local level, in my seat of Hindmarsh, I want to congratulate the Morphettville Park Roos, who won their women's football league division 1 premiership. They defeated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         West Adelaide
        </a>
        , another good local club, in a fine game. I also attended one of the games at the Morphettville Park Football Club and spoke to club members. I look forward to continuing to support the club in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the efforts of a number of other local football clubs in Hindmarsh. The Seaton Ramblers had their end-of-season presentation last Friday. It was a fine evening. I want to congratulate all the award winners from the club. The previous week, I attended the Plympton Bulldogs junior football club presentation. A number of people have said it is a great family club, and I can see why from their presentation. Both clubs are community focused, with dedicated volunteers, and their committees do a great job. Finally, well done to the Henley Sharks on their season, losing to eventual premiers Goodwood Saints, and to the Sacred Heart Old Collegians, who made the div 2 grand final. Next year, hopefully, like the Port Adelaide Football Club, they will all win the premiership!
