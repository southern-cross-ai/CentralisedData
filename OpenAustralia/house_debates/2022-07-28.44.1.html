        I rise to speak about a problem that has been ignored by WA Labor and is putting lives in Mandurah at riskâ€”that is, the McGowan government's failure to fix the Peel Health Campus. The hospital is yet to receive upgrades promised by the Premier over a year ago, and the Premier knows that the facilities are old, the services are limited and capacity is much too small.
       </p>
       <p>
        Back in 2019 I ran a grassroots campaign and, with the people of Mandurah, secured $25 million from the previous coalition government to upgrade the emergency department at the hospital. And what did Labor do? They poured $10 million into a new car park. Whilst the state government delays, the crisis only gets worse. When I spoke back in May 2018, ambulances were ramped for 20 hours that month. By this last month, ramping hours had skyrocketed to more than 450. That means that for almost 17 hours every day a patient waits in an ambulance, unable to get into the hospital for treatment, and that is simply not good enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of the Peel region trusted
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGowan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . They elected four state Labor members of parliament and they have been let down. In 2018 I said that the people of Mandurah were angry. Well, they're still angry, and rightly so. They know they've been forgotten by McGowan and WA Labor. It is time for the Premier to fix this situation. After almost six years in government, he can only blame himself.
