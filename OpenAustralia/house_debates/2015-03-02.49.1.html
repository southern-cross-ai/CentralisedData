        It is always great to rise in this place and celebrate the wonderful game of football—the world game. It is interesting to note that the latest ABS data show that nearly three times as many Australians play the world game than do Australian rules. As a parliamentary co-convener with my good friend the member for Moreton of the Parliamentary Friends of

        , our focus is continuing to build people's awareness of the great game here on the hill. I have also recently stepped back into the game and have now the joy of playing football at Loganholme football club with my two sons.

        Unfortunately, when you look at sport overall we see a decline in the number of people participating in sport. For the youth in our community, when we are suffering health effects from obesity and other things, I think it is important that we continue to have more and more people play various sports. One of our great local businesses is one of our great local gyms—Global Gym 24/7 in Loganholme. Christo and the team there are placing a huge focus on getting people fit and involved in an active lifestyle. They have recently donated 30 free memberships and 30 free entries to their 12-week challenge. I welcome their commitment to improving the overall health of people in our community and look forward to hearing back about the results. No doubt their efforts will have a positive effect.
