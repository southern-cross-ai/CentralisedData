        How good is it to have an ad man running the country? Normally, a business goes to an advertising company if they've got a product to sell, but not this mob—five years in government, three

        Today we learnt that, in his first year as Prime Minister, they've racked up $175 million in government advertising—and there is some astounding stuff here. The Treasurer, never shy of self-promotion, has spent $18 million on his tax cut advertising. But the two standouts are the energy minister and the infrastructure minister—$45 million between them. You can just imagine the conversation between the energy minister and his ad men: 'I want to run an advertising campaign.' 'What's your energy policy?'

        look like a documentary. Our roads are stuffed but $16 million is spent on advertising a program that doesn't start for another five years.
