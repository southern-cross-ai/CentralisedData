        I am speaking today about a very important organisation, the Bully Zero Australia Foundation, and the great work it does across this nation. The foundation's mission is to provide genuine and enduring care for bullying victims and their families. The foundation raises awareness of bullying and its devastating consequences in schools, workplaces and the wider community. The Bully Zero Australia Foundation started to take shape after Mr Oscar Yildiz was strongly moved upon hearing about the death of a young man, Allem Halkic, a 17-year-old, back in 2009. Allem was the victim of cyberbullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the official launch in March 2013 by Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Bully Zero Australia Foundation, I heard the grief in the voices of Allem's mum and dad, Ali and Dina Halkic, who were suffering through the loss of their child. Of course, the loss of a child is a loss no parents ever want to face. Ali said: 'If only I understood the impact of social media. I thought my son was safe in his bedroom. I was wrong, and I paid the ultimate price and lost Allem to cyberbullying.' Ali and Dina's pain reminded us to be more vigilant about what our kids are doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since that time, the foundation has been extremely active in raising awareness and delivering resources, working towards a zero-tolerance culture of bullying in Australia. Bullying is becoming an increasingly dangerous aspect in our communities, especially with social media becoming a mainstay in our lives. The power of one cannot be underestimated, and it should be the difference between how the victims perceive the situation and the reality of manageable behaviour. Be an upstander not a bystander. The largest group in a bullying situation is the bystander, but most people look on and do nothing. If you see it, hear it, then stop it!
       </p>

        I have worked with the Bully Zero Australia Foundation since its inception, and recently attended the foundation's Make Bullying Disappear charity ball. I congratulate Julia Schembri, the board and the organisation for such a sensational night.    To Oscar: I love your passion and dedication, your never-ending drive and energy to make Bully Zero Australia Foundation the success it is today. The event was hugely successful with some 1,200 attendees, including politicians, business and community leaders. All shared a vision to end bullying, raising some $273,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to the foundation for giving me the honour of becoming an ambassador for this important and remarkable organisation. I join Bully Zero ambassadors including Courtney Thorpe,

        , Laetisha Scanlan and of course Isobelle Brosnahan, the youngest Bully ambassador. I make the commitment to consistently work hard for Bully Zero Foundation Australia, ensuring their mission to reduce bullying to zero is achieved in the near future. Preventing bullying is everyone's responsibility and business. We all have a responsibility to act to put a stop to this behaviour.
