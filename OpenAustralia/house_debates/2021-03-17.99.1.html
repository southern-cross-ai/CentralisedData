        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the reports that the government will introduce legislation to allow domestic violence victims to take $10,000 out of their superannuation. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he is asking victims of domestic violence to fund their own escape plans, increasing their likelihood of retiring in poverty, but won't support 10 days paid domestic violence leave?

         I thank the member for her question. The measure she refers to was part of the first Women's Economic Security Statement, but there has been a second statement in the most recent budget. The purpose of both of those statements was to provide as much security as we possibly can through the various measures that were put in place through both of those packages. As to the measure which the member refers to, there is some draft legislation which has been issued. We've been consulting with various groups around the country on their views about that, and they've raised strong concerns about the nature of that measure. We're listening to those concerns, and that measure is now under review.
