        I rise to commend my colleagues in the WA Liberal Party, particularly Kyran O'Donnell, the member for Kalgoorlie, for blocking the gold tax increase that threatened thousands of jobs in my electorate. Last week, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        n opposition announced that it would vote against the increase in gold royalties and hold the state Labor government accountable for its broken promises. It's the second time in 12 months that politicians have set their sights on the mining industry as a fresh source of revenue, and I'm pleased to say that both attempts are now dead in the water.

        , I represent Kalgoorlie-Boulder, the heart of Australia's gold industry since the late 19th century. The gold industry is starting to recover after a few lean years. I've witnessed people in this community endure some really tough times in recent years and their resolve and optimism has been inspiring. Now, at a time when the gold industry is moving forward and confidence is starting to recover throughout the Goldfields, the WA Labor government saw an opportunity to increase royalties. The immediate response was a slow-down in exploration and investment. The long-term impact would have been mothballed mines and unemployed workers.

        , promised the people of Kalgoorlie-Boulder that he wouldn't increase royalties, and it took less than six months in office for him to break the promise. A thriving mining industry that creates jobs for Western Australia is better for the state's finances than increasing taxes for a short-term revenue lift. I thank my
