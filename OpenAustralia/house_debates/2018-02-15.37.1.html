       <p>
        It was a great day yesterday in that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        , that lawless organisation, had two great decisions handed down against them, one by the High Court and one by the Federal Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable member: How did they go?
       </p>
       <p>
        They went appallinglyâ€”that's how they went. So no longer will CFMEU officials who continue to break the law be able to have their fines that are imposed by courts paid for them by the CFMEU. This is all about accountability. If we break the law then we are held to account by the law, but, up until yesterday, CFMEU officials were able to break the law and the CFMEU would come along and write the cheque for them. There was no accountability. This is all about ensuring that CFMEU officials are held accountable, just like every other member of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the second decision brought down by the Federal Court just yesterday there were two $500,000 fines, taking the number of fines imposed on the CFMEU to $13 million. The CFMEU was the first organisation in this country to receive $10 million in fines. They have now received $13 million in fines for breaking the law. They must be held accountable. They're no different from you and me.
