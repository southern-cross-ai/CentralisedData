        For many people, getting older means winding down and having a quieter life. This is definitely not the case for 97-year-old Lorna Allen. Lorna lives in her own self-care unit. Her week revolves around volunteering for 25 to 30 hours at the Caroona Jarman Nursing Home. She has been volunteering at Caroona for nearly 50 years. Lorna helps the residents get ready for outings, with bus trips and with their shopping. There has been many a time when Lorna has just sat with a resident in their time of sickness or need so they are not alone. She also helps with cooking for special functions as well as with their annual fete and their fortnightly happy-hour functions. There is good news, too. As a volunteer, Lorna, even though she is 97, had to undergo a police check to volunteer at the home. She passed, which was great news. Lorna, thank you.
