        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science—and I hear the opposition cheering! Will the minister advise the House how the government is supporting critical national research infrastructure in Australia and how this will secure jobs and growth? What support have these measures attracted from overseas?

         I thank the member for Swan for his question. I doubt that the opposition would be cheering, because they do not cheer any good news coming out of the economy or out of the government. They only want to cheer bad news—and tax, spend and borrow some more.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Swan asked me about our support for critical national research infrastructure. I am very pleased to be able to say that as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, which the Prime Minister and I announced last December, we are putting enormous investment into critical national research infrastructure that makes a huge difference to jobs and growth here in Australia. For example, over the next 10 years we will potentially put $1½ billion into the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. And I know that there are critical researchers and scientists in the member for Swan's electorate who have been benefiting from the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, a scheme that had no funding at all going forward under Labor. I found a short-term measure last year to save it, to fix the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. In last year's National Innovation and Science Agenda we fixed it for good, for the next 10 years, so that it will continue to provide support for national critical research infrastructure and researchers, who are making such a difference in creating the wealth in our economy through science and research that drive jobs and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         But that is not all. We have also in the National Innovation and Science Agenda announced $520 million for the Australian synchrotron, a vital piece of infrastructure that will drive science and research jobs over the years to come. And I am very pleased that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         government has announced that they will support the Australian synchrotron, along with 10 other countries. New Zealand will put $4½ million into the Australian synchrotron over the next few years so that they can be part of that critical and important piece of research infrastructure. I am sure that the National Innovation and Science Agenda formed part of the discussions in the Prime Minister's very successful visit with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key last week.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also put $294 million, almost $300 million, into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array" rel="nofollow">
          Square Kilometre Array
         </a>
         , which is going to make a tremendous difference to things like driverless vehicles in the mining industry, making sure that we are creating more wealth and more investment in our country. 'More jobs and more growth' is the mantra of this government. We are focused on jobs and growth while Labor is focused on taxing, spending and borrowing. Finally, we have made a $26 million investment in quantum computing because, if we win the quantum computing race in the world, it will mean vast treasure and jobs for the Australian economy. We are getting on with the job of delivering for Australia.
