        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives

        We, the undersigned residents, local business, and employees of the Tuggeranong region of the

        , wish to bring to-the House's attention that a reversal of our population demise depends on Commonwealth Public Service jobs for Tuggeranong as the fundamental backbone of our local economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Public Service jobs are the major contributor to the security and prosperity of our families and communities. These jobs will ensure our safety, our health, and our environment. Any loss of public service jobs reduces household income and consumer spending, hurting businesses and our economy.

       <p class="italic">
        Therefore We call on the House to do all in its power to

        1. Maintain and improve existing public service jobs that are located in the Tuggeranong region; and

       <p class="italic">
        2. To locate in Tuggeranong CBD the required 40,000 to 42,000 square meters of space that is needed to house the newly consolidated Commonwealth Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 905 citizens

        Canberra is built on a satellite city concept which has created national capital of micro-economies. If Canberra is to continue to prosper, it is important that each of these micro-economies is supported and remains strong. That is why I am pleased today to table in parliament a petition from the residents, local businesses, Tuggeranong community council, employees and community groups of Canberra to call for the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to remain in one of Canberra's great satellite cities, Tuggeranong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service jobs based in Tuggeranong are the backbone of the local economy. Over 900 petitioners, including myself, are therefore calling on the House to do all in its power to maintain and improve existing Public Service jobs in the Tuggeranong region. Specifically we are calling for the 40,000 square metres of space that is needed to house the newly-consolidated FaHCSIA building to be located in the Tuggeranong CBD. FaHCSIA employs more than 1,000 people who currently support the many businesses and services of Tuggeranong. Moving these jobs out of Tuggeranong would have a huge impact on small businesses and services in the area. It would significantly weaken one of our vitally important satellite cities and micro-economies. Let us keep every part of Canberra strong, let us keep FaHCSIA in Tuggeranong.
