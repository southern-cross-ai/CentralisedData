        I've had the absolute pleasure of visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Hilda's" rel="nofollow">
         St Hilda's
        </a>
        , a beautiful and prestigious school for girls in my electorate, several times over the last month. First, it was to celebrate the commissioning of the new principal, Mrs Virginia Warner, a great asset to the school community whom I know will make a very lasting difference. At the commissioning, I saw—for the very first time, I think—an all-girl eight-piece saxophone section in the big band, and I couldn't resist offering the music master a sound workshop on the instrument that I played for 35 years as a professional. I enjoyed the workshop, which was a great success, very much. The girls told me that they learned an awful lot, which made me very happy.

        the year I was born in 1968. The year 6 students at St Hilda's have been learning about the Australian political system and they're coming to Canberra, so I spent some time talking to them about this place before their upcoming school trip. I took some time with the year 6 girls to answer their questions, and many of the hands were still raised at the end of the Q&amp;A session—I'll get to that next time. What a privilege it is to represent St Hilda's and their families in this place as the member for Moncrieff.
