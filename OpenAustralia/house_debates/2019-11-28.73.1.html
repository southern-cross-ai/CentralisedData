       <p>
        There is no doubt that small and medium businesses, which employ nearly 40 per cent of workers in this country, are the backbone of Australia's economy. From your favourite coffee shop down the road from your house to the dry cleaners a couple of blocks away, everywhere you look and everywhere you go there is a business within your community providing a service you probably wouldn't be able to live without.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate of Longman had 13,146 small to medium businesses as of April 2019, all of whom are giving back to their community, where and when they can, and providing important economic significance. The Morrison government has always invested in small and medium businesses. This is evidenced by the fact that business confidence from traders across Australia increased after the results of this year's federal election. It comes down to one wordâ€”confidence. The Morrison government's achievements in reducing unemployment and creating jobs in the past few years have helped businesses as more people have disposable income.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a small business owner myself, I know the challenges, tests and trials that come with being a small business owner. But I also know the rewards. I have seen what the Morrison government has achieved for local businesses over the years, and I know how important it is to have a government that always backs our small and medium businesses. The $30,000 instant asset write-off is just one example of this government's support. The more breaks small businesses can receive, the more people we can employ.
