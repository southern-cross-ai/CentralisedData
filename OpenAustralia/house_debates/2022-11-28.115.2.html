       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and the co-chair, the member for Hinkler, I present the committee's fifth report for 2022. This report considers three proposals referred to the committee in September this year, with a combined value of over $549 million. Two of the three proposals are from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , for redevelopments at Robertson Barracks in Darwin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>

        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . The third proposal is for a fit-out of the ABC offices in Parramatta and Ultimo,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works at Robertson Barracks in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        will upgrade and expand the facilities and allow for future expansion, at a proposed code of $389 million. Robertson Barracks supports approximately 5,000 personnel, including an annual six-month rotation of about 2,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Marines. The scope of proposed works includes upgrades to the living and accommodation, messing facilities and water and electrical services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project is for redevelopment at HMAS
        <i>

        </i>
        , which is a navy base located in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        .
        <i>
         Harman
        </i>
        is used as a communications and operational facility as well as providing all the administrative support for Navy personnel in the Canberra region. The redevelopment is needed to replace ageing facilities. The project covers improvements to the engineering, infrastructure and office accommodation. It will also give additional security to the base entry and refurbish the living and accommodation. The project will also provide a much-needed new gymnasium. The total proposed cost for the redevelopment is $116 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third proposed work is smaller, with a proposed cost of $44 million, for a fit-out of the ABC offices in its Parramatta and Ultimo offices in Sydney.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        is seeking to expand the ABCs presence in Parramatta to reflect Parramatta's status as one of Australia's fastest growing areas and home to 2.6 million Australians. At the same time, the ABC will refurbish the Ultimo offices, which are owned by the ABC, and lease out some of the unused space. Both fit-outs will reflect an increased move to flexible working arrangements for ABC staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Works Committee would also like to extend its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of these inquiries. We would also like to thank the personnel of both the Department of Defence and the ABC for their presentations on these projects. The committee was able to travel to inspect the proposed works at both Robertson Barracks and HMAS
        <i>
         Harman
        </i>
        . These were valuable visits with comprehensive briefings from defence staff. For all three projects the committee recommends that it is expedient that proposed works be carried out. I commend the report to the House.
