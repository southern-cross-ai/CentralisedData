        Brian 'Fredo' Frederiksen of Minnie Water retired from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley Council
        </a>
        last week. His service to the local communities of Wooli, Minnie Water and Diggers Camp will be missed. Brian has been the council's village maintenance man, responsible for keeping the streets, parks and public access areas clean for locals and visitors. The community got together last Sunday to farewell Fredo, attending a barbecue held at the Wooli rural fire shed. Carmel Young presented Fredo with a golden shovel to say thank you for his service, and Carmel also presented a nine 'carrot' necklace to Fredo's wife, Jane. I'd like to wish Fredo all the best in his retirement. I thank him for his dedication to our community over the last 15 years, including as a volunteer with the Minnie Water Rural Fire Service.

        Last Friday, the Lismore Workers Club said goodbye to one of its longest-serving employees, duty manager John Eather, who has given over 40 years of service to the club. John met his partner, Leanne, at work. Congratulations, John, on your 40 years of service and well-earned retirement. You were always a friendly face. Good luck.
