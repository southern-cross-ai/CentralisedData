        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on the government's record $50 billion infrastructure investment program, including projects in my electorate of Page? What is the importance of building infrastructure in a timely and cost-efficient manner?

         I thank the member for Page for his question. He is a great champion of small business in his community, because he knows that this is a government which is getting on with the job. This is a government which is focused on building for the future. The Turnbull-Joyce government is investing in a record $50 billion infrastructure investment program. I know the member for Grayndler likes it. I mentioned the Turnbull-Joyce government. The member for Grayndler is the people's choice after all. It is spring racing time, and he seems to be up and about these last couple of days. He seems to be up and about at the moment. The Leader of the Opposition must feel like that horse that leads on the first leg of the

         . It is a long, long way to go. The member for Grayndler is a stayer. He has been here for 20 years, and I reckon there are plenty over there who are backing him as well. They are backing him to finish over the top, watching him on the second lap—

           Thank you, Mr Speaker. On this side of the House we are focused on delivering. The member for Page knows the value of good infrastructure right across Australia. He knows that when you invest in good infrastructure you change people's lives in his community, and you can save people's lives. Look at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Pacific Highway
           </a>
           project, where he is encouraging local businesses to be involved in the government investment in this outstanding project—$5.6 billion from the federal government is going into this project. I know that the member for Capricornia is a huge supporter of investment in her community. There is $35 million going into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Downs_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Peak Downs Highway
           </a>
           bridges project. Right across Australia, we have the member for Fisher with $743 million invested in the Caloundra Road to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
            Sunshine Motorway
           </a>
           ; and the member for MacPherson, who has been a great champion of investment in her community. Right across this side of the House we have members who are supporting investing in infrastructure. We are getting on with the job, while Labor is simply getting in the way, refusing to help us get value for money for the Australian taxpayers.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is not just us that are warning about the challenges to our infrastructure program. We have had the Master Builders. Their director of construction policy, Corlia Roos, said early this year:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           More than 50% of all working days lost in Australia are in the construction sector. This is an extraordinary amount which forces up the cost of building tax-payer funded schools, hospitals and public infrastructure by as much as 30%.
          </p>
          <p>
           One million Australians and 300,000 small business operators are working in the building and construction sector. On this side of the chamber we are on their side. We stand with those small business owners and their employees. Those opposite are standing with union thugs, and they know it. We are getting on with the job. This government is providing funding to thousands of projects which are driving economic growth and productivity right across the nation. We are providing jobs for the future. Those opposite are blocking us every step of the way.
