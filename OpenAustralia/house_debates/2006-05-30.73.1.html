       <p>
        I rise tonight to praise the efforts of an organisation called the Friends of Ermera. The Friends of Ermera is an aid agency based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Narre Warren
        </a>
        in Melbourne, in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . As its name suggests, the Friends of Ermera focuses its efforts entirely on the Ermera district in western
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        . Ermera is a landlocked district and is home to over 100,000 people. Ermera’s capital, Gleno, is located 30 kilometres south-west of Dili.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the House would be aware, on 20 May 2002, East Timor became the world’s newest sovereign state. The events of the last few weeks have been a poignant reminder of the immense challenges that lie ahead of this fledgling nation. However, the Friends of Ermera have been great ambassadors for helping out the people of East Timor.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 24 April this year, I had the privilege of meeting this group, which includes president, Jan Trezise; vice-president, Mary Mumford; secretary,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Daniel" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Daniel
        </a>
        ; treasurer, Phillip Rocke; and committee members: Joyce Robeiro, Lynn Bryan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hudson" rel="nofollow">
         Don Hudson
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Clarke
        </a>
        , Judy Barton, Marilyn Davidson, Ann Riswick, Judith Kierce and my great friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_James" rel="nofollow">
         Jack James
        </a>
        . They explained that the group was formed in June 2002, with the aim of helping the people of Ermera rebuild their lives and their communities after the violence and destruction that followed East Timor’s vote of independence in 1999. Tragically, we are seeing the same incidents occurring again today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Initially the group’s sole focus was education. It has since extended that to programs for health and sanitation, women’s groups and export assistance. Each year, since 2002, the Friends of Ermera has provided materials such as picture books, puzzles and easels to kindergartens and schools. The group has rebuilt four kindergartens in the district, and a fifth is near completion. What an amazing effort. I say again that it has contributed to building four kindergartens.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Friends of Ermera is also undertaking fundraising through Australian schools to generate funds to repair school buildings, reinstate basketball courts and provide adequate toilets and water supplies. Through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPAL" rel="nofollow">
         OPAL
        </a>
        organisation, Overseas Pharmaceutical Aids for Life, the Friends of Ermera has provided basic pharmaceuticals such as ointments and antibiotics for ear and eye infections. The Friends of Ermera has also supported several women’s groups throughout the district by providing sewing materials—a basic commodity, yet something that is vitally needed by the local residents. Moreover, it has funded a women’s shelter that provides adult literacy classes and that is a safe harbour for women and children who are victims of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met with the members of the group last month, they were very anxious to impress upon me their view that Australian aid should be directed at building capacity across East Timor. Tragically, at the moment, with recent events, we are seeing the majority of our aid being spent on security measures, but I was pleased to assure them that this is exactly the approach that the Australian government is taking.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Friends of Ermera can rest assured that the Australian government is helping East Timor to build effective national institutions and public administrations with their new revenue. Major increases in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        revenues have the potential to underwrite East Timor’s development in coming years. However, East Timor’s transition to a stable and democratic nation will involve first and foremost strengthening law and governance.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point, I congratulate the Australian defence forces on their fantastic work. I also recognise the efforts of the Minister for Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
         Brendan Nelson
        </a>
        , the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Downer" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Downer
        </a>
        , and, at the time, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Costello
        </a>
        . This has been a fantastic effort by the Australian defence forces. It is exceptionally dangerous and, with my background in the police force, I look with horror at how the ADF were required to disarm gangs who were looting with weapons such as knives and firearms. It is absolutely tragic what is happening over there. I commend the ADF. Now the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        are also on the ground, and their first task is to investigate the tragic murders of members of the police.
