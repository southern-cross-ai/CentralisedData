                 (4) notes that the consequence of 'Universal Access' on Victoria's kindergartens is that many will no longer be able to offer 'three-year-old kindergarten' programs because facilities are often shared between three and 'four-year-old kindergarten' programs;

                <p class="italic">
                 (6) notes that some rural kindergartens could face the risk of closure because there is a shortage of qualified teachers in rural areas, and due to the increase in mandated hours, many rural kindergartens will no longer be able to share teachers;

                 (7) notes that warnings of this imminent crisis for Victoria's kindergartens have been given directly to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth by the Municipal Association of Victoria, parent groups, kindergarten operators and parliamentarians; and
