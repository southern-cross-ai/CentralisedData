        Last week I had the honour of attending a local function to celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         The Entrance

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">

        ’s 50th anniversary. As the federal member for Dobell I was honoured to be asked to propose a toast to the international Lions organisation, and I would like to place on record in the House my appreciation of the fantastic work our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs
        </a>
        do to make their local areas even better places to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have worked closely with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Lions as the federal member for Dobell and, I must say, they are always happy to get in and get their hands dirty for the sheer fellowship of working alongside other Lions and giving something back to the Central Coast community. I would specifically like to acknowledge president Rod Slater, secretary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turner" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Turner
        </a>
        and the many other members who selflessly give up their time for the betterment of our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1917, Lions Clubs have offered people the opportunity to give something back to their communities. From involving members in projects as local as cleaning up an area park, Lions Clubs have always embraced those committed to building a brighter future for their local area. In 1947, Lions reached Australia with the formation of the first Lions Club at Lismore. Today, with more than approximately 46,000 clubs in 200 countries and geographical areas,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs International
        </a>
        is the world’s largest community service organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lions are recognised worldwide for their service to the blind and visually impaired. This service began when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller" rel="nofollow">
         Helen Keller
        </a>
        challenged the Lions to become knights of the blind in the crusade against darkness, during the association’s 1925 international convention. Today, in addition to their international SightFirst program, Lions extend their commitment to sight conservation through countless local efforts. Lions are also involved in a variety of other activities to improve their communities and help people in need, such as assisting the hearing impaired, providing diabetes awareness and education materials, working on environmental projects and developing youth programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lions have expanded their focus to help meet the ever-increasing needs of our global community. In the area of Dobell, Lions run a market day on Sundays at The Entrance. One of their major projects was the creation of the sensory gardens at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         North Entrance
        </a>
        . It is a very welcome place to be and has a national monument to our fallen comrades from the various theatres of war. Their programs are continually changing to meet new needs and greater demands, but their mission, ‘we serve’, has never wavered. I commend the organisation and its members for their unique and selfless commitment to local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        On another topic, I would like to inform the House of the plight of local residents in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Jetty" rel="nofollow">
         Long Jetty
        </a>
        area of my electorate. Many local residents have registered with me their concerns about proposals by Wyong council and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Roads and Traffic Authority to make Tuggerah Parade at Long Jetty a one-way northbound road. Equally concerned are residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Bay Road
        </a>
        through to Shelly Beach Road who have been made aware their streets may be upgraded to main roads as an alternative option for southbound traffic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have recently gone on public record to say that I will continue to fight to stop Tuggerah Parade from becoming part of this absurd proposal. While traffic congestion along The Entrance Road needs to be addressed, this quick, easy solution that threatens the unique lifestyle of Central Coast residents is not the answer. Tuggerah Parade is a quiet residential road that has parklands and lake foreshore along one side. These parklands are used by local families from all over my electorate for their picnic and recreational facilities. Additionally, community groups including The Entrance Girl Guides hold various activities using the park facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have told local residents recently, I am writing to the state Labor member for The Entrance,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_McBride" rel="nofollow">
         Grant McBride
        </a>
        , and Wyong council to encourage a commonsense approach to this matter. The member for The Entrance has recently joined a number of community leaders by offering his support to a local community group known as Southern Lakes Communities for Children, a subsidiary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Benevolent Society
        </a>
        . This group would like to turn part of this recreational area into a regional park.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has merits and, during recent discussions with the organisers, I encouraged them to pursue the idea. However, the Labor member on the one hand supports the Communities for Children but on the other turned a blind eye to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTA" rel="nofollow">
         RTA
        </a>
        proposal. It may look good on paper but it is at the cost of our local lifestyle. It is clearly a case of the Labor member playing popular politics in the lead-up to the New South Wales state election.
       </p>
       <p>
        With great fanfare recently, the New South Wales Labor government announced the so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Highway
        </a>
        . It currently runs a chicane through Long Jetty but it is nothing more than a few signs on the freeway and a few down The Entrance Road.
