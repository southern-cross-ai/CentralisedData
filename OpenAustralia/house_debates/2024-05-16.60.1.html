        , known to all as Bill. Bill was conscripted in 1970, aged 20, and he served 469 days of service with the 86th Transport Platoon, returning to Australia in 1972. I met Bill in his role as the president of the Plympton Glenelg

        . Bill was awarded an Order of Australia medal in 2014 and an Anzac of the Year award in 2023. Bill made a difference to his communities, and he will be missed. He was also a great bloke to have a drink and a chat with, always very generous with his time and his stories. Vale, Bill Hignett. May he rest in peace.
