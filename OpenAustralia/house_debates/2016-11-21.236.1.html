          <p>
           I rise today to discuss the important work done by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
            White Ribbon
           </a>
           organisation. This Friday is White Ribbon Day. White Ribbon Australia is part of an international movement that engages men to provide strong leadership to stop violence against women. White Ribbon recognises that as men are the predominant perpetrators of violence against women it is men who should take a strong lead in preventing this violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whilst it is true that only some men are violent, men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of violence in the home. Australian police deal on average with one domestic violence matter every two minutes. That is 5,000 a week—a huge number by any standard. These are not just meaningless statistics. These statistics reflect real people. It could be your neighbour, your colleague or your friend. In 2016 approximately one women has been murdered each week by a current or previous partner and one in four women in Australia has experienced physical or sexual abuse from an intimate partner.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are many factors that contribute to violence within the home and many obstacles to overcome in order to effect permanent change. There is no doubt that violence against women is deeply rooted in power imbalances that are reinforced by gender norms, gendered roles and stereotypes of how men and women should behave. This is why it is important that men show leadership in this space; that we have difficult conversations with our sons, with our brothers, with our fathers and with our friends; that we have difficult conversations about respect and about equality; and that we call out inappropriate comments, behaviours and attitudes. Men speaking to other men about violence against women is a powerful catalyst for change. These conversations are important, as are actions—actions by men in leadership positions advocating social policy change.
          </p>
          <p>
           That being said, it is always important to remember that, as violence against women is fundamentally an issue created by men, a male-led group responding to this problem is in a delicate situation. It is reasonable to ask whether a problem that is caused by men is best solved by more men. I have some sympathy for this view and always try to scrutinise my own engagement with this issue through this lens. However, the sad reality is that many of the men who need to hear White Ribbon's message simply will not listen to it if a woman is the messenger. That is part of the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I do think that White Ribbon will always play an important part in this space, even if it is a role that does require continuous self-reflection. Given that men can be both part of the problem and part of the solution here, they carry special obligations when engaging in this debate. The first is to listen to the women around them about their experiences of gender inequality—experiences that we can, by definition, not understand firsthand. The second is to take responsibility for attitudes and actions that perpetuate gender inequality and, as a result, men's violence against women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Family violence has progressed an enormous deal in the time that I have been a member of this parliament—just the last three years—through high-profile cases and the tireless work of advocates and community groups such as White Ribbon, but there is so much more to be done. Organisations like White Ribbon fight for the elimination of violence against women in our communities, and I am proud that many of the community institutions in my electorate are active White Ribbon ambassadors and activists. Two that come readily to mind are the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
            Western Bulldogs
           </a>
           football team, who played in a White Ribbon-branded game this year, this year being their first premiership year in some time, and also the DONS, the Dads of Newport &amp; Surrounds, a fathers group supporting each other as new fathers in Newport, a suburb in my electorate, and supporting their partners becoming new mothers. They got together an enormous fundraiser last year and raised many thousands of dollars for White Ribbon off their own initiative. We had a gala ball at the substation at Newport. It was a very encouraging thing to see.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is encouraging because these are organic initiatives in our community. They are not top-down driven; they are men taking responsibility and taking action within their community, and that is what White Ribbon is really for. Through education, awareness raising, creative partnerships and preventative programs, White Ribbon provides the tools for men to stop violence against women in their community and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a member of parliament, I have drawn heavily on the hard-won experience and expertise of activists like White Ribbon. As the convener of the federal Parliamentarians Against Family Violence Friendship Group, I have tried to provide a platform for voices to be heard in the corridors of power. I am pleased to stand with them and fight for them.

           <p>
            I thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing forward this essential debate. This coming Friday is
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
             White Ribbon
            </a>
            Day, the international day for the elimination of violence against women. I am honoured to be an ambassador for this cause. Each year, ambassadors restate their oath, and I will say it again here: I pledge never to commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women. It is not a long pledge; it is not a complex statement; and it is not a demanding request. To be honest, it should be so banal, such obvious common sense, that it should not need to be said at all, and yet, sadly, it is a pledge we must repeat annually to remind ourselves of the terrible spectre of domestic violence in our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            As if the concept of domestic violence were not repulsive enough, the figures underline just how prevalent it is in our society today. A woman dies at the hands of a current or former partner nearly every week. One woman in three has experienced physical violence since the age of 15. One woman in five has experienced sexual violence. One woman in four has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. More than half of the women who have experienced violence had children in their care when the violence occurred. Many millions of women in this country have been touched by domestic violence. This must stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sad fact of domestic violence in Australia is that, rather than being perpetrated by strangers on the street, women who are at risk of violence are more likely to experience it in their own homes by men they know. I firmly believe that men are not naturally violent. Violent and abusive behaviours are learnt. Sadly, for some violence, it is a way of expressing masculinity, or sometimes it simply comes from a complete lack of respect for women. All men must develop respectful relationships with women, and we must be an example to other men. We must treat women with respect and as equals. Words can damage, and we must consider our language as well as our actions and how they can be interpreted.
           </p>
           <p>
            White Ribbon campaign is one of the world's largest movements to raise awareness and funds for the prevention of violence perpetrated against women. Critically, it is a male-led movement. It engages and empowers men and boys to be leaders in a change of attitudes and behaviours. Violence, most obviously, damages the victim but it also carries a profound impact on the wider community, and individuals carry physical and psychological scars for years, if not decades, to come. I am very happy to say that domestic violence has been at the forefront of the coalition's agenda since we came to office in 2013, and we have built momentum around the issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first act of the Turnbull government was to announce a $100 million Women's Safety Package, which focused on practical, immediate action to keep women and children safe, as well as improving training for frontline workers. Just last month, the government co-hosted the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
             COAG
            </a>
            national summit on reducing violence against women and their children. This summit brought together first ministers, women's safety ministers, academics and experts in domestic and family violence, and leaders in the business and not-for-profit sectors to review progress and highlight best practices in efforts to reduce violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the summit, COAG launched the Third Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. This includes $100 million committed for the preventative strategies and cultural change, for frontline services like housing and financial support, to prevent forms of sexual violence and to address family violence in Indigenous communities and $30 million for frontline family violence legal services. These funds and initiatives represent a big commitment from the government to ending the scourge of domestic violence. I, with everyone involved in the implementation, hope that together we can make a difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to end with the same words that I said for the speech for White Ribbon Day last year. I fear I may need to say it for many more years to come, but the words bear repeating.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Attitudes must change: violence against a partner is never excusable. No matter how intense relationships may get, violence is never the answer, and victims of abuse must know that it is never their fault. I say to all men: the most masculine, the most manly thing you can do is always to respect your partner.

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
              White Ribbon
             </a>
             ambassador for many years now, as have been many others in this place. This is an organisation that raises awareness about the role that men must absolutely play in stopping domestic violence, and, indeed, all forms of violence against women. I cannot stress enough how important it is for men to take a much more active role in this national campaign, and, in doing so, fight this scourge on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
             The statistics tell us a very grim story. We heard some of the stats earlier. According to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Bureau of Statistics
             </a>
             , one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone they know. One in five women have experience harassment within the workplace. Over a 12-month period, on average, one woman is killed every week by a current or former partner. These are unacceptable figures. These women are someone's mother, daughter or sister. This is how the statistics are generally reported. It is very unfortunate, dreadful and terrible, and we should do all we can to turn those statistics around so they give us a figure of zero. That should be our aim.

             But, if we express these statistics differently, we see that this is very much a problem that is caused by men. It is men perpetrating these horrendous acts. One in three men have perpetrated physical and/or sexual violence against a woman they know. One in five men have harassed a woman within the workplace. Over 12 months, on average, every week a man kills his current or former partner. These men, again, are someone's father, brother or son. This is an unacceptable situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             We all have an obligation to act and speak out, especially us blokes. It is absolutely important that, when we see language being used that is derogatory towards women or when we see an unacceptable situation, we call it for what it is and not just bow our heads and basically act as if nothing is happening. It is unacceptable, and it is us blokes that can tell other blokes that this sort of behaviour is not on.

             This is why I was so pleased recently that the National Retail Association has supported a push to include an entitlement of 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave as part of the modern award structure. In doing so, the National Retail Association has demonstrated courage and leadership. It has broken ranks with the

             and the Australian Retailers Association, who are all opposing the claim for paid domestic violence leave. The association's stand has gained international attention, being reported all around the world as a positive thing, and I join those sincerely commending the National Retail Association's strong and proactive stand on this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             The retail industry is the largest employer of young people in the country and one of the largest employers of women in the country. Women comprise 56 per cent of the retail trade workforce, and, as such, the highest proportion of victims—women aged between 18 and 24—are likely to be working in those retail industries. That is why this move by the National Retail Association is so important. In fact,
             <i>
              Family violence and the Australian retail industry
             </i>
             , a report prepared for the National Retail Association, revealed that 45,000 women, or almost seven per cent of the retail workforce, experienced some form of domestic violence during the 2014-15 period. That is a huge number.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, paid domestic violence leave is not going to solve this huge social problem overnight. However, it is an important step and an important part of the solution.

              . This movement has grown to encompass over 60 countries around the world and stands as a shining example of men standing up for women. It is an important movement, as the fight to end domestic violence cannot be fought by women alone.

              I am proud to support this motion both as a woman in the Liberal Party and as a member of the Turnbull coalition government, which has taken many steps to address this most serious of issues. The coalition has a strong record of men leading the charge against domestic violence, as prime ministers Howard, Abbott and Turnbull all developed and launched programs to combat domestic violence. Since being elected to government by the Australian people in 2013 and re-elected this year, the coalition government has made respect for women—and for every other Australian—a priority. There is never any excuse for domestic violence and I applaud the government for taking strong action to eliminate all disrespect and violence against women. The sad fact is that too many women are victims of domestic violence each and every week. According to a 2012
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">

              Personal Safety Survey, one in three women has been a victim of physical or sexual violence from the age of 15 by someone known to them. This same survey found that one in four women have been emotionally abused by a partner. But the most distressing figure comes from the 2015

              report, which found that one woman dies almost every week at the hands of a current or former partner.

             <p>
              Addressing the awful problem of domestic violence has been at the forefront of the Turnbull government's agenda. The first act of the Turnbull government was to announce a $100 million Women's Safety Package on 24 September 2015. At the time of the announcement, a staggering 63 women had been killed by a current or former partner for the year. The Women's Safety Package is part of the Turnbull government's approach to take real, practical and immediate action to keep women and children safe. The $100 million package focuses on improved training for frontline workers, enhancing service delivery and providing the best educational resources to change attitudes in our community. The states and territories, in partnership with the coalition government, have also launched a $30 million national campaign to change young people's attitudes to women and to violence. The campaign website has received almost 400,000 views and there have been more than 32 million online views of the

             <p>
              Domestic violence has been at the forefront of the coalition's agenda since we came to office in 2013 and we have built momentum around the issue. The 2016-17 budget committed $100 million for initiatives under the Third Action Plan. We announced during the campaign that this would include $20 million for preventative strategies and cultural change, $15 million for frontline services like housing and financial support, $10 million to support victims of revenge porn, $25 million to address family violence in Indigenous communities and $30 million for frontline family violence legal services. We also committed almost $10 million to develop a comprehensive national Domestic Violence Order information-sharing system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Crucially, under the $25 million program a number of specific actions are targeted at assisting Indigenous women, who are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of family violence. The government announced up to $15 million to enable police in Queensland to better respond to domestic violence in remote communities and for measures that reduce reoffending by Indigenous perpetrators. We announced $1.4 million to extend the community engagement police officers in remote Indigenous communities in the

               I thank the member for Gellibrand for moving this motion, which goes to the heart of why I came to this place. In my electorate, and in Perth's south-east more generally, domestic violence is at a crisis point. Domestic violence is far and away the largest offence group of offences against the person. Over 2015-16 there were 3,477 domestic violence offences committed in the South East Metropolitan police district and the sanction rate for these offences was just 22.4 per cent. WA police are identifying domestic violence offences but, for various reasons, insufficient evidence exists for them to proceed against the perpetrator. These figures paint an unacceptable picture of the issues in homes across my community, but it is not until you hear the stories at the heart of the crisis that you truly grasp the extent of the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               Through my work as a local lawyer in the south-east, I became involved with Starick Services, which runs two refuges for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence. I joined the board of Starick and I went on to become its chairperson, and I also represented the sector on the state advisory committee. Starick is much more than a women's refuge. It pioneered the use of assistance officers in police stations and courthouses. It runs programs in high schools to raise awareness of domestic violence and to break the cycle of violence. In the words of domestic violence survivor, Mary, who was supported by Starick:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I am so very thankful for the women's refuges throughout Perth, the police who see the destruction first hand yet continue to care for me in the wee hours when nobody else can help, the magistrates who watch our declining culture day in and day out but choose to protect us, still, by putting boundaries in place, and all the people who became a voice for those who had lost theirs.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I am glad that they didn't grow despondent and give up and that on their hard days they continued to press on and serve their community and in all honesty, by doing so, save lives.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               They saved my life and the lives of the seven others that were in my care. For that I am thankful.

              <p>
               Ending the scourge of violence against women will require bipartisan support in this place and in our community. And I am glad to see members opposite rise to support the member for Gellibrand's motion. But, unfortunately, that bipartisanship is not translated into real support in some areas from this government. Since coming to office, the Abbott-Turnbull government has cut a combined $52 million from community legal centres, Aboriginal and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
                Torres Strait
               </a>
               Islander legal centres and legal aid services, which help domestic violence victims every day. That has impacted heavily on local services like the Gosnells Community Legal Centre in Burt. While the recent announcement of new funding for these services was welcome, it does not make up for the previous cuts. It is crucial that we see these funds flow to our front line services in Perth's south-east.
              </p>
              <p>
               Overall, last month's

               </a>
               summit on reducing violence against women and their children was a missed opportunity to deal with the scourge of family violence. More than a third of people accessing homelessness services are family violence victims, yet we have seen no real action to boost funding to these services. We also need to protect domestic violence victims by guaranteeing personal leave when they access help, yet this remains off limits under the Liberal government—a truly shameful situation. We need firmer commitments, better funding and real reform to support family violence victims from this government. Anything less is failing those in our society who need our help most.
              </p>
              <p>
               As with so many areas of inequality and discrimination, achieving great change involves not just the courage of victims but a push for real change by those responsible. In this way,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
                White Ribbon

               , as an organisation targeting at engaging men, is working to change the culture of the group in our society most likely to inflict violence on others—men. The existence and work of White Ribbon does not detract from the fact that some perpetrators of domestic violence are indeed women. And I have worked as a lawyer for men who were victims of domestic violence. Let us not be distracted. We must, as a society, rid ourselves of behaviour that sees around 100 women die each year from domestic violence. So I am proud to stand in support of White Ribbon and join hundreds of thousands of Australian men in saying that I will stand up, speak out and act to prevent men's violence against women. This is my oath.

                I will begin by restating the oath that I will stand up, speak out and act to prevent men's violence against women. This Friday is

                for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Eliminating chronic issues of domestic violence speaks to who we are—a community and a country that espouses mutual respect and dignity—and that is why I am proud to support White Ribbon Day by particularly speaking out about these issues.

That is the reality of the human experience.

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Montreal" rel="nofollow">
                 University of Montreal
                </a>
                witnessed a tragedy where a male student slaughtered 14 of his fellow female students. In the wake of that event, a group of men in Toronto decided to speak out and establish a male-led movement known as White Ribbon, which now represents an international effort of men, young and old, working together to eliminate violence against women. Their minor but passionate plea for mutual respect is now echoed across the world in almost 60 countries. And of course, as an Australian, I am proud to say that we are part of that global effort.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are three key statistics concerning violence against women that highlight the unnerving ubiquity of this issue. One in three women has experienced violence at the hands of men; one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them; and one in four children is exposed to some form of domestic violence. But this is not just a matter of statistics; it is about human lives that are impacted—the women and families whose aspirations were sabotaged by those who were seemingly closest to them. Sadly, many Australians know of someone who has endured the tragic consequences of violence against women.
               </p>
               <p>
                A member of the Goldstein community, Jodie Hickey, saw the tragedy of domestic violence firsthand. In 2000 her best friend, Mary, was killed by her husband, who is now on parole and confined to his home state of Queensland. On the first anniversary of Mary's death, Jodie came together with friends to raise a glass in honour of her memory. Since then, Jodie's efforts to raise awareness of domestic violence have gained momentum. With each year, raffle prizes and stalls have been added, turning the occasion into a far-reaching event in support of White Ribbon Day, and this year she is doing so through a sold-out high tea that will mark the 16th anniversary of Mary's death. With increased numbers and excitement, Jodie is helping to build on last year's efforts to build and honour the continuing memory, but also to turn tragedy into an opportunity for hope and bringing the community together. So far they have raised $6,000 for the White Ribbon cause. Helped by her two elder sons, Jodie's efforts in championing the fight against violence against women are truly inspiring. She is a tireless advocate for a society that respects women, and I look forward to joining Jodie this Sunday for part of her activities, because violence against women is a man's issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                Through education, raising awareness and political advocacy, we can work together to effect change and to improve attitudes for the good. But it takes men, like those who participate in White Ribbon, to stand up and speak out about these horrific crimes against women and to recognise that we are all part of a solution—both in terms of raising visibility, and in coming together to take collective action to improve the culture within our society so that people can feel safe and secure no matter where they are. That is the task before us—to build a future that is free from violence and abuse.
               </p>

                I am particularly proud of Jodie's efforts in my community, because she is somebody who has demonstrated—again, as one of the wonderful women of Goldstein—that she is able to bring people together to effect positive change. It is through turning these tragedies into moments of opportunity to improve our country and our culture that our community does so much good and represents a model that can be amplified and have resonance and impact across our great country. And so, to Jodie and to all of the people who are supporting and participating in White Ribbon events this Friday as well as the event on Sunday, and to everybody in Goldstein, we say, 'Thank you.'

                 for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This coming Friday I will be taking part in a Cabramatta police and community event—the White Ribbon Walk—which will involve many in the community coming together as one to pledge their support against violence against women.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Last Monday at the Whitlam Library in Cabramatta I attended the launch of the White Ribbon Day campaign and signed on to the pledge never to commit, excuse or remain silent in respect of violence against women. By now we all know the statistics—one in three women will be a victim of physical violence; one in five will be a victim of sexual violence; and currently, and most disturbingly, two women are being murdered by a partner or a former partner each week. As a nation we have grieved these deaths. We have heard the stories of the horrendous acts of violence against women, and yet it continues. I know that more than 50 per cent of assaults reported to my local police are domestic violence related. I also know that 60 per cent of boys growing up in an abusive household are likely to become abusers themselves. What is more chilling is that 50 per cent of girls growing up in such an environment are likely to take an abuser for a partner, and the cycle goes on. As a husband, a father of a daughter, and a proud grandfather of four girls, I am petrified at the thought that that statistic may one day apply to one of those women who mean most to me in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The issue of violence against women is very real, and it is happening in all our neighbourhoods. It involves women no matter how successful, strong or resilient they are and whatever their ethnic or religious backgrounds. Most of the victims, through fear of reprisal or harm to their children, do not seek help. The number of unreported cases of violence against women is staggering. If we are to walk towards eradicating domestic violence, we must give women the confidence to come forward, report these crimes and engage with our police. We need more men to stand up and say this is not acceptable. We need more men educating the community about violence against women. In fact, what we need is more men—more real men. It is not okay to hit a woman, it is not okay to be domineering against a person that you love, and it is not okay to force a woman into compliance. It is not right that women live in fear, not knowing when their partner may once again lash out. These women are constantly walking on eggshells and are obviously riddled with anxiety. Today we should remember those women who have lost their lives through domestic violence and also their families who still grieve their loss. It is not enough to give speeches each year as we approach White Ribbon Day. It is imperative that we as a community take responsibility and look out for our families, our friends and our neighbours.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are a number of organisations in my community working very hard to spread the message that violence against women and children is simply not acceptable. I would like to commend each of those organisations. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the great work of Betty Green, the chair of Bonnie Support Services, who not only look after the direct victims of domestic violence but play a very significant role in looking after their children as well. These are organisations that play a very significant role in our community, trying to bring an end to domestic violence and looking after the victims. Clearly we must change the attitude that women can be controlled or dominated by men. For the health of our community, we must commit to make this change. I would also like to thank our local White Ribbon committee for their work. In particular, I acknowledge the great work of Detective Chief Inspector Darren Newman and his team at the Cabramatta Local Area Command. They are certainly playing a very significant role in drawing attention to violence against women. Committing domestic violence is not the only inexcusable act. Remaining silent is almost as bad.

                  ambassador, I am very pleased to speak on this motion today ahead of White Ribbon Day, this Friday, 25 November. This year's theme is 'Stand up, speak out and act'. It is incredibly sad to think that one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual abuse perpetrated by someone known to her and that, on average, one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner. I pledge today to stand up, speak out and act for women in my life and in my community. I draw your attention to #AMansIssueToo.

                  White Ribbon Australia's vision is of a nation that respects women and in which every woman lives in safety, free of all forms of abuse. Through education, awareness-raising campaigns, prevention programs and partnerships, White Ribbon Australia highlights the positive role that men play in preventing men's violence against women and supports them to be part of this social change.

                  Nationally, the Turnbull government is taking important steps to tackle domestic violence and family violence. At the end of October the Prime Minister launched the third action plan for the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. This $100 million plan provides the leadership, policies and resources needed to make a real difference in keeping women and children safe. It sets out 36 practical actions under six key areas. These are: preventing and intervening early; improving responses and supports for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                   Indigenous Australians
                  </a>
                  ; providing greater support and choice for women and children; sharpening the focus on sexual violence; responding to children living with violence; and holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  During the election campaign I welcomed the commitment of $25 million within the action plan for specific measures to address violence against Indigenous women. Aboriginal and

                   Torres Strait Islander
                  </a>
                  women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised and 10 times more likely to be killed as a result of domestic violence than are women in the broader community. Targeted investment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is critical to saving lives and to disrupting intergenerational cycles of violence, dysfunction and disadvantage. These funds will help to improve the quality and accessibility of services in Indigenous communities, train a skilled workforce, provide culturally appropriate and community-led perpetrator programs, boost legal services, help kids to access information through technology and to build on the national Stop it at the Start campaign. It continues the work that is already underway through the coalition's $100 million Women's Safety Package, introduced in September 2015.

This year, the team started a Tablelands service, which has received a warm welcome from the community. Just last week they launched in the southern Tablelands, with a domestic violence worker now based in Ravenshoe Community Centre.

                  I encourage women in these communities to come forward and just talk to someone if they are feeling threatened or experiencing violence. The service is also driving the Community Champions Ending Violence Against Women project. This federally-funded leadership program for community members, business and other groups aims to create and nurture a culture of intolerance towards domestic and family violence and improve their responses as a community. After a two-day course, the champions host an activity in their community, whether it is a morning tea to raise awareness or to develop a workplace policy. Anybody interested in taking part in these programs can contact the Cairns Regional Domestic Violence Service on (07)40336100.

                   It is really important that every man in this country understands their obligation as men—as men!—to stand up and speak out against violence against women and children. It is not acceptable under any circumstances: we know it and we need to make sure that every man in Australia knows it, understands it and does something about it. We must take responsibility.

Men speaking to other men about violence against women is a powerful catalyst for change, and it is men I want to talk about here today—men in my own electorate who are making a difference in terms of accepting their responsibility to speak out. But we cannot escape the facts. In the

                   a third of police time is spent dealing with domestic violence, and Aboriginal women are victims in 70 per cent of all cases. As of June 2016, 83 per cent of reported assaults in Katherine were associated with domestic violence. In

What a thing to be said by a person who is supposed to be an Attorney-General responsible for justice and looking after the community. In my electorate, there will be three White Ribbon marches calling out exactly the behaviour exhibited by Mr Elferink—in Darwin, Katherine and my hometown of Alice Springs, as well as communities across the rest of the Northern Territory.

                   I want to refer now to the 'No More' campaign. The 'No More' campaign started in 2006 with the principal advocate being Mr

                   , a very great and a very good Australian, a great man for standing up against violence and abuse within families against children. The momentum for this came about because Aboriginal men in the Northern Territory were saying they wanted their voices to be heard in consultations about family issues, including family violence. I want to commend men like Johnny Liddle in Alice Springs at the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, who was at the forefront of organising marches in Alice Springs, seminars and camps around issues to do with family violence and violence against women, attracting people from across Australia. I want to commend the people in Katherine. I participated some years ago in marching up the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway" rel="nofollow">

                   , blocking the Stuart Highway, talking about violence against women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   These are important initiatives, and it is wrong to think, as some people would have us believe, that all Aboriginal men are violent towards their spouses or partners, or women and children generally. That is not the case. There are many great champions; Charlie King and Johnny Liddle are but two. It is important that we take the message of Charlie King's 'No More' campaign and do link arms together to say that we are fed up; it is not going to happen. We will not accept that it is an appropriate way to deal with women, or differences between men and women and children. It is just not acceptable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We need to say we support and recognise the things that are being done by

                   teams and rugby league teams across this country, who are saying that, if you have been found guilty of an offence involving family violence, you cannot play our game. That is important: a great disincentive for people to be involved in family violence. It develops advocacy around family violence and teaches young men about their responsibilities towards women and children in their communities, but we also need to understand the importance of addressing the needs of the victims.

                   , and CAWLS, the Central Australian Women's Legal Service. These organisations are dealing with the victims of family violence. These organisations need support that they are currently not getting from the federal government. I say to the federal government: use this opportunity of this week to understand that it is our mutual responsibility to support these women and advocate against family violence, particularly violence against women.

                    I would like to thank the other members who have spoken on this motion and to speak today in this place about

                    </a>
                    Day. I am proud to say that, as a White Ribbon ambassador, I support fully the many organisations in my electorate of Forde that do so much terrific work to help women who find themselves in this very difficult situation.
                   </p>

                    White Ribbon Day is about all Australian men standing up and speaking out to prevent men's violence against women, because making women safe is an issue for us men as well. As the member for Lingiari has just touched on, this is not to say that all Australian men are guilty of domestic violence. There are many good men in all of our communities who do a tremendous amount of work to help eradicate this scourge. Yet, sadly, still one in six Australian women have experienced violence from a current or former partner.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    White Ribbon Day is held annually on 25 November and signals the start of 16 days of local work to stop violence against women. This day is significant in highlighting a major issue in our country. Putting an end to domestic violence is something our communities should be working towards every day. Domestic and family violence is preventable and can be stopped. Victims of violence often live in fear for themselves and their families, even when they have left an abusive relationship.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Over the past 18 months, significant progress has been made in the Australian community in raising awareness of domestic and family violence. As a government, we are addressing what should be a simple goal—that is, that all Australians deserve a life free from violence. Too many times we have witnessed the devastating impact domestic and family violence has on our community. These tragic deaths of women and children highlight the need for continued action. Domestic, family and sexual violence is unacceptable in any circumstances, and I commend the Prime Minister and the government for pledging a $100 million package to fight against it. The package of measures provides a safety net for women and children at high risk of experiencing violence. It also improves frontline support services, looks to using innovative technological solutions to help keep women safe, and provides educational resources to help change community attitudes towards violence and abuse. More than $21 million from the package has been allocated to specific measures to help Indigenous women and communities, who are at even higher risk, as the members for Leichhardt and Lingiari spoke on at length.

                   <p>
                    Putting a stop to domestic violence remains a national priority, and the government is acting to put an end to violence against women and children. In my electorate of Forde, the Logan police district has established a dedicated domestic violence and management team. Led by Larissa Shaw, herself a victim of domestic violence, this team takes a proactive approach to dealing with high-risk domestic violence matters, and I want to commend them on the work that they have done in this space. I know from talking to them that it is a very difficult job and that it is not pleasant having to walk into many of the situations they have to deal with. This is a tremendously positive step from our hardworking police force, who are committed to making our community safer for everybody. One of the things they have managed to do with this program is to identify those families who are at higher than normal risk due to other activities that go on with those families, in particular drug and alcohol abuse. Through their work they have been able to mitigate a number of circumstances and rescue the women and children from a very dangerous situation. Logan Women's health, as well, do a tremendous job helping women in very difficult circumstances.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I commend everybody in my community and communities right around Australia for the terrific work they do to help reduce and remove the scourge of domestic violence. On White Ribbon Day I stand with the other men in our community and share my support for ending domestic and family violence in our country.
