        I preface my question to you, Mr Speaker, by noting that in 1988 when this building was created and developed the water features were a major part of its beauty. My point is that since 2006-07 all the water features have been turned off, which really changed the look and the ambience of the whole place. I was perhaps under the misunderstanding that, once we got back to 50 per cent water storage in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , we would have all of the water features turned back on. I know that with those that have been turned back on—the forecourt and some others—they are using recycled water. Do you have an answer for when the rest of the garden will be restored to what it was meant to be?

         It is true that, because of the rains in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         region and the level of the catchments increasing, there have been changes to the restrictions, but the ACT authority has moved to a more permanent water conservation program and that means that the Department of Parliamentary Services has to liaise with those authorities to gain permission for the refilling of water features. That is being done progressively. The important thing I should stress is that at this stage there has been no permanent closure of any of the water features and there is discussion that, if water features are to be put out of action from time to time, we achieve a better aesthetic treatment of those that are closed down than we have had for the last four or five years.
