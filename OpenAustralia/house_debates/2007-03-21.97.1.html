        On Wednesday, 21 February I was absolutely delighted to attend the official reopening of the

        For several years this must have been the unluckiest bowls club in Australia. Who would have thought that, when we are in the midst of having some of the driest years on record, the Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club would have managed to have been flooded out not once but twice, destroying the greens and the possible future viability of the club. Given the disastrous impact the loss of a green had on the clubâ€™s finances, it is no exaggeration to say that, while things were looking fairly grim for the club, they never gave up and always wanted to make sure that they stayed alive to provide support for the local community.

        last year, I attended a crisis meeting, at which things looked fairly grim. Considering that this club has been in operation since 1929 and is one of the few clubs in the area, it would have been an absolute tragedy for all people, whether young or old, had the club not survived. I know that Upwey High School has students there undertaking bowls training. It is just a fantastic club.

        The Australian government, under the Regional Partnerships Program, has made a contribution of $40,000 to complement funding and in-kind support from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        , the

         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        , Belgrave Taxation Services, Robin Southern Coaching and the Victorian state government. The Australian government funding went specifically to replacing the lights and to drainage works.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the club president, Robin Southern, for his tireless work in getting it all together. I would also like to congratulate the following committee members in particular for their efforts: Mr Ken Walters, Mr Max Frost and Mr Michael Walker. It was a fantastic project. I would also like to mention both Sofia and Maya from the Melbourne East Area Consultative Committee who worked tirelessly with the club to get their application up to speed. Once again, the opening was a fantastic night. My bowling has not improved over time, but I am sure, if I keep going there, my game will get there. I congratulate the club and wish them a long-term future.
