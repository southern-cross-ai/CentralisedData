       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2010 referring a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), my response is as follows.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. While the Government takes no position on Falun Gong beliefs, it considers that China’s ban on Falun Gong and the treatment of its practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Government has consistently raised these concerns with the Chinese authorities. Senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also raised Australia’s concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners through diplomatic channels in Canberra and Beijing, and during the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Canberra in February 2009. We expect the next round to take place in China in 2010.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We are also aware of Falun Gong-related claims of organ harvesting. If true, these reports would be very disturbing. China has denied the allegations and the information we have seen so far is inconclusive.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Government will continue to raise its concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China with Chinese authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the former
       <b>
        Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith
