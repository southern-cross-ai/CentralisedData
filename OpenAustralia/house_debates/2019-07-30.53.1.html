        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is empowering communities to take action in their local environments with programs such as the Environment Restoration Fund, including in my electorate of Lindsay?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Lindsay for her question, and I congratulate her on her outstanding start in the 46th Parliament. She was in my office in week 1, in her quiet determined way, making sure that I knew of all the environment projects that she had spent the last few months fighting for in Lindsay.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of our plan for a cleaner environment, we launched the Communities Environment Program this week. It's supporting grassroots organisations working on small projects that make a big difference. In fact there's an information session after question time for all members of the House. They are projects up to $20,000 that you can work with your local communities to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today I want to highlight another of our key election commitments: the Environment Restoration Fund. This is a $100 million fund that is designed to support major environmental projects that have lasting conservation benefits. It's designed around three key areas: cleaning up and protecting our coasts, waterways and oceans; protecting threatened species and migratory habitats, particularly of shore birds; and increasing recycling and reducing waste.
        </p>
        <p>
         These projects can be seen across Australia. There has been $6 million allocated to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and northern
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         to save our koalas and invest in wildlife rescue and wildlife hospitals; I know that's of great interest to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. In Victoria—the member for Higgins will be very interested in this—we are cleaning up the Yarra, improving the health of the lower reaches of Melbourne's Yarra River and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip_Bay" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , and working to pick up rubbish and clean up our river for all of our community. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         the member for Swan has been in my office talking about a partnership that involves improving the Swan-Canning estuary, reed management and community education—getting everyone involved from schoolkids on. Also in Western Australia we are protecting the black cockatoos by providing $1 million to support the nesting habitat for the black cockatoos.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank and congratulate the member for Lindsay for her support for her community. She knows that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepean_River" rel="nofollow">
          Nepean River
         </a>
         is the heart of Lindsay. Every weekend hundreds of families come to this river. With the funding she has secured, volunteers will be able to work hard at repairing the vegetation and cleaning out weeds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether we are talking about the smaller Communities Environment Program or the larger Environment Restoration Fund, this is all about partnerships. It's not about going through advocates or agencies; it's about going through the people who actually do the work on the ground. This government is on the side of Australians caring for their environment in their communities.
