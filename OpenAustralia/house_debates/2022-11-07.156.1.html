       <p>
        HOLI () (): The Albanese Labor government handed down its first budget, and I am pleased to say it is a great budget for the people of the Hunter electorate, who were neglected for so long under the former government. This is a budget that invests in what Australians need to build a better future. It is a great budget for families and a great budget for our nation. There is a lot in the budget for the people of the Hunter such as investment in infrastructure projects and many other items that will benefit the Hunter. Childcare costs are a huge issue for families and our cheaper childcare policy will see 6,300 families in the Hunter electorate better off. We will also extend paid parental leave, giving more time to families at that important time of life when they are welcoming a new baby. The people of the Hunter electorate can also expect to see cheaper medicines, which will save them up to $450 per year and help with the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was elected to be a strong voice for the Hunter, and the government has certainly heard me. This budget delivers over $400 million for all of our election commitments across the Hunter. The Muswellbrook bypass is a big-ticket item, along with money for the Muswellbrook town centre, Muswellbrook Olympic Park upgrade and Muswellbrook preschool and playgroup. Singleton Council will receive an upgrade for the Alroy oval precinct, the Singleton Bulls club amenities fit out and women's changerooms. Cessnock Council received money for the Cessnock regional skate park, the

        and the Cessnock Goanna's lighting upgrade.

        Council received funding for Mandalong Road upgrade, money for a dredge in Lake Macquarie and a grouting fund, money for Mums' Cottage, funding for the urban rivers project and for the north-west Lake Macquarie catalyst area, and funding for Edgeworth Eagles fencing and lighting.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will be delivering an urgent Medicare care clinic for Cessnock. This is really important, as the Hunter has some of the lowest rates of bulk billing in the country. There is also money for the

        </a>
        after-hours access clinic at Toronto to have its services restored after the previous government slashed it. This will help to take the pressure off the hospitals and is a really important announcement for Hunter. We have 967 new university placements for the Hunter at the

        </a>
        commitments, this will make education more accessible for many in the Hunter electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to have a government that delivers on its promises and invests in the future of the Hunter. This is critically important not just for the people of the Hunter but for the whole nation.
