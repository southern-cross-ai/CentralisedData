        Seventy-five years ago a young

He joined community members, former students, teachers, staff and of course current students to celebrate this truly historic milestone. St Anthony's school, part of the

        parish in Clovelly, opened in January 1918 as both a primary and a secondary school with about 45 students and was run by the

         Sisters of St Joseph

        . In those days, the sisters used to walk from their convent at Bondi over the sand hills to undertake classes with the kids.

       <p>
        Over the last century, the school has grown to close to 200 students. It has remained true to its core values of love and service. The school was last updated in 2011 with a

        addition to the school that's been well loved by the school community. It is clear that the school's core values have helped make the school such an important part of the Clovelly community. I want to congratulate Georgia Walsh and Jack Mellick, the school captains, who led the school in celebrations on the weekend, the principal, Kim White, all of the staff for the wonderful job and all of the teachers and community member who have been involved in this important school over the last century.
