        Australians shouldn't be surprised that a government that has turned rorting into an Olympic sport is going to turn a blind eye to the scammers that are driving Australians crazy. If it were just the bogus phone calls and

        and the member for Hughes, it would be bad enough, but it's not. Thirty-three billion dollars a year is being ripped out of Australian households and small businesses while this bloke over here does absolutely nothing.

        Labor agrees: we should be going after the anonymous online trolls that are terrorising our kids, but what about the frauds? This week we saw this bloke at it again. The guy who doesn't hold a hose and doesn't have a bill was standing up in this place, saying, 'I've got a big announcement to make about going after frauds and scammers and bullies.' You won't see a bill before the election; it's all announcement with no follow-through. He has turned parliament into a protection palace for the rorters in his cabinet and in this party room, and he's turned Australia into a paradise for scammers. There's something very sinister about this Prime Minister. Something worse than doing nothing: he's giving a green light to the scammers to steal from Australian households and small businesses.
