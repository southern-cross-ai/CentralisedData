        It was a busy time in my electorate of Brisbane last week, with three ministerial visits. First of all, we had the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        , the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        , who visited Lyndhurst Early Learning Centre. He was shown around by centre manager, Kate Jamieson, and operations manager, Chris Sciffer, to see firsthand how the budget delivers for families. The professionalism of the centre staff was evident for all to see.
       </p>

        On Thursday, we had a visit from a man who I think has the most challenging job in Australia, the Treasurer. He inherited a set of books from Labor mired in debt and deficit. The Treasurer was warmly received in my electorate, which is home to 30,000 small businesses. Like me, he grew up in a small business family and he understands that real initiative and wealth generation in this country comes from men and women who run small businesses and who are prepared to have a go.

        Finally, yesterday we had the icing on the cake—pretty much literally—with the Prime Minister visiting Dolci Sapori, a small business in Brisbane which makes the finest traditional Italian desserts you are ever likely to find. And, thanks to the government's small business package announced in the budget, Aladino Pozzebon from Dolci Sapori will be able to refrigerate his delivery van and he will be able to expand his business. That is what this government is all about. It is about rewarding people to have a go, and in Brisbane there is no shortage of people who want to have a go and build the economy.
