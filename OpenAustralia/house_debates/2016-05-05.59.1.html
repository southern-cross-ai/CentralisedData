       <p>
        I rise to speak today to let the people of the Macquarie electorate know I am honoured indeed to represent them and, whilst I and the coalition have been working to deliver a sound and responsible budget, I have also spent this week, as I have in the past few months, advocating on their behalf regarding the Western Sydney Airport. I want to see a second airport—one which is safe, environmentally responsible and community minded—but I will not let go of meeting with my colleagues and the decision makers. I notice the minister for infrastructure here; he has given me and my community many hours of listening; he is one of the decision makers for an alternative, particularly to the current proposed flight paths over Blaxland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy recently announced by Labor and their local candidate is flawed. It only works as long as the wind does not blow and it does not rain, making their plan unworkable, unreliable and unsafe. How can residents trust a candidate who has been advocating against an airport but last month stood beside Labor hierarchy in supporting Labor's national platform for an airport?
       </p>
       <p>
        I have said this from the start: I am for an airport, for the jobs and benefits it will bring to our local economy. But I have fought and will continue to fight for alternative flight paths—ones that are safe, are not formulated on the run, and have the approval of the relevant aeronautical bodies.
