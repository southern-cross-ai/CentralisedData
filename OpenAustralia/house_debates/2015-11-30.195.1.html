        Bennelong has many organisations at the cutting edge of their fields, perhaps none more impressive than Royal Rehab in Ryde. Founded by a deaf and blind woman in the final years of the 19th century Royal Rehab has grown to be the country's leading rehabilitation hospital, catering for brain trauma and spinal injuries, as well as stroke and other complex neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Royal Rehab also offers its world-class services to practitioners nationwide through their registered training courses. The Certificate

        , which is both a theoretical and a practical course, includes extensive treatment carried out with a patient, forcing students to use their skills whilst also learning bedside manner and other essential interpersonal skills necessary for a successful job in this profession.

        On Friday, I had the honour of being at the graduation ceremony for the latest cohort of Certificate IV in Allied Health students. It was a wonderful ceremony, also attended by the New South Wales Minister for Health,

        . The students I spoke to praised the quality of the course, with some already securing employment on the back of their studies at Royal Rehab. I would like to congratulate all of the students who graduated last week and recognise the wonderful work of Royal Rehab, not just in mending the broken lives but also in the passing-on of their top-class knowledge and practices so that more people around the country can benefit from their experience.
