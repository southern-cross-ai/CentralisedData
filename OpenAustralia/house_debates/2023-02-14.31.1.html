         Orientation Week

        is just around the corner for many young, and a few not-so-young, Queenslanders. O-week is such an exciting time for people just about to start their university and career journeys. O-week introduces people to university life, helps them find their way around campus and sort out classes, and can even help them sort out accommodation, but possibly one of the best things about O-week is the opportunity it opens up to meet new people and have new experiences.

        Way back in the

         Middle Ages
        </a>
        —1983—I left the bush and took my first steps towards higher learning. In that first week I met two people who are still my best friends today, 40 years on. Hello, John and Erin! So I say to all the eager or nervous new university students: pay attention to the people you first meet, because you could be making lifelong friends. Whether you are straight out of high school, maybe from a small country town, heading to the big smoke for the first time, or whether you are a mature-age student going back to uni or perhaps changing careers and going to uni for the first time, make sure to say hello and start up conversations with some of the new people you meet. And look after each other. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to band together to find your way to the next event or even back to your car—or to the bus stop. It's better to be in a group of lost travellers than on your own. Cherish this time of your life, as you will go away with some memories and experiences that will live with you forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I'll give a shout-out to another Perrett who will be commencing university life this month. My eldest son, some 40 years after his father, will commence his uni studies. I wish him and everyone all the best. Enjoy the learning experience—and clean your room!
