        On 2 June 1946 the people of Italy voted in a referendum on whether Italy should be a monarchy or a republic. This week Italians and friends of Italy around the world celebrate Fester Della Repubblica in recognition of the anniversary of that date. On Sunday I was very pleased to attend the Fester Della Repubblica celebrations at Club Marconi in conjunction with the Sydney Committee for the Festival of the

        .

        have made an enormous contribution to this nation, and I am glad the member for Makin is in this chamber—a very eminent and distinguished Australian of Italian heritage who, as it happens, has relatives in my electorate. But I was pleased to be able to attend that event, which was, as Club Marconi always puts on, a very special event. It has around 20,000 visitors—Australians who are friends of Italy and Australians of Italian heritage celebrating Italian heritage and culture.

        In a very literal sense, Italians have played a big role in building Australia, whether it is the

        scheme not far from where we sit in this parliament, whether it is houses and shops throughout my electorate, whether it is Club Marconi or anywhere the Italian-Australian community has been prevalent.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Italian" rel="nofollow">
         The Italian

        community has very literally contributed to the building of Australia but, as I said on Sunday, they have also contributed to the building of Australian society and Australian culture. They were pioneers of Australian multiculturalism in many ways. As Italy was voting on its future in 1946, we began for the first time to welcome Italians in significant numbers. We have, of course, a long history of Italian presence in Australia but there was a significant increase in the years and decades following 1946. It is now difficult to imagine an Australia without Australians of Italian heritage as an important part of our society. I know many honourable members, including the honourable member for Fowler, have significant Italian-Australian populations and celebrate the Festa della Repubblica.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, this year is the 150th anniversary of Italian unification into a single state. I know that that is a significant event in the Italian calendar.

        -General has been invited to Italy—as I understand it, as one of only five non-European heads of state to be invited—in recognition by the Italian government of the very special relationship between Italy and Australia which has been forged by those generations of Italian-Australians. So I take this opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to Australians of Italian heritage, to the contribution Italy has made to the world and to the contribution that individuals have made to Australia over recent decades.
