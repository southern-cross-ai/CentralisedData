        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and minister representing the Minister for Resources and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        . Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is driving Australia's economic growth by supporting major mining projects, such as Adani's Carmichael coalmine? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any threats to the jobs and economic development this project will deliver to the communities of Capricornia and across Australia?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she is intensely interested in making sure the Adani mine gets going, as all
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         ers are, as the member for Flynn and the member for Dawson are and as the member for Herbert should be but of course he is not. The reason they should be interested in the Adani mine is the $34.5 billion that the coalmining sector brings into Australia and the 44,000 workers, predominantly blue-collar workers, who are employed in the mining industry—a group of people that once upon a time the Labor Party used to support. The Labor Party used to support labourers, but they have given up on that. I remind the member for Herbert that the unemployment level in Townsville, at 11.3 per cent, means that she should be a strong advocate for the Adani mine and she should be driving the Labor Party, that used to support labourers, to support the Adani mine, and in that quest to get the Adani mine going she should be supported by the member for Shortland. He should be supporting coal workers. The member for Hunter should be supporting coal workers. But they are not.

           The Labor Party have given up on labourers, in hot pursuit of vegan burgers up and down

           and they have given up on people at the Railway Hotel at Cessnock. The Labor Party have lost their soul. They will not let the member for Grayndler, who actually is responsible for building things, speak. He is in splendid isolation—he can't say boo. The man has lost his tongue; he is talking in sign language. What happened to the party that used to be the party of

Where are the Mick Youngs in the Labor Party these days? Where are the people in the Labor Party who actually did labour, who actually did manual work? We hear a lot about the school teachers and a lot about the solicitors, and fair enough, but they have given up on labourers. Where are the people who should be standing up for people in the
