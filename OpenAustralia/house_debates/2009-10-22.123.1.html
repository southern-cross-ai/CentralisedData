        I rise to congratulate the

         Oxley Creek
        </a>
        Catchment Association, who have won the 2009 Theiss Riverprize. The generous prize, which will make a real difference, is $200,000. Of that, $150,000 will go towards the restoration, protection and sustainable management of Oxley Creek while the association will direct the remaining $50,000 to support another waterway organisation that needs help to improve their area—perhaps in western Queensland or northern Queensland. The association will then be able to use their learning and initiative so they can be duplicated in another community. So congratulations to Anne Clarke and to all members and volunteers of the association, who do such a fine job protecting one of the south side of Brisbane’s greatest environmental assets.

        Beginning in Flinders Peak, near Ipswich, Oxley Creek twists and turns its way nearly 70 kilometres through Logan and Brisbane’s south side, including the suburbs of Rocklea, Archerfield,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_Ridge" rel="nofollow">

        , Oxley and Corinda—in my electorate—before meeting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_River" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane River
        </a>
        in Tennyson. On the banks of the Oxley Creek grow weeping bottlebrush and figs, providing a unique habitat for native birds, both local and migratory, including even Jabiru. Although in my walks there I have never seen any Jabiru, I have seen some twitchers. Some bird spotters have given me some books that have photos of Jabiru. There are lots of other animals there as well. There are all sorts of interesting birds there. In fact, I noticed on the weekend that we had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Kerr" rel="nofollow">
         Miranda Kerr

        come from overseas. She spent some time down at the Oxley Common for a charity event. I have never seen so many people at Oxley Common. Obviously Miranda Kerr has a bit more attraction than Jabiru!
       </p>

        However, I was sad to see the Healthy Waterways report card for the Oxley catchment that was handed down yesterday. The freshwater results released yesterday unfortunately gave the Oxley catchment an ‘F’. The streams are in poor condition and there is significant decline in nutrient recycling throughout the year; however, there was a slight improvement in the physical chemical indicator. The estuary, where the Oxley Creek meets the Brisbane River at Tennyson, was given a ‘D’. They said it has continued low-dissolved oxygen and increases in nutrients and turbidity and in phytoplankton abundance, particularly above seven kilometres from the mouth of the estuary. I was at the Corinda State High School the other day. Some of the year nine students had actually done some experiments on Oxley Creek. Their science class results would reflect the Healthy Waterways assessment. Obviously, with an ‘F’ and a ‘D’ we need to do a lot more.

        The beautiful Flinders Peak is not in my electorate but, closer to home I am particularly interested in the Oxley Creek Common area. The common includes walking paths, shelter and farming land which is used by Corinda State High School students in their agricultural program and also for local residents to walk their dogs et cetera. I have been approached by a number of individuals and community groups recently who want to see more done to develop the environmental aspects of Oxley Creek Common. I understand the state government has a draft future community planning strategy in place and that this strategy is the basis for ongoing consultation with stakeholders and community groups like Friends of Oxley Creek Common and the Oxley Creek Catchment Association. This sort of community consultation is important. I would contrast that with the horrible community consultation that took place with the Sherwood bus depot, which is right next door to the Oxley Creek Common, and the disastrous approach by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        in saying, ‘This is what will be rammed down your throat.’ I would take a slightly different approach. I would like to consult with the Brisbane City Council, the state government and our environment minister to see what can be done to look after this unique area right in the middle of Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        The planning strategy covers such aspects as how will we continue to make sure that Corinda State High School’s agricultural program continues. I was talking about this with the principal, Helen Jamieson—who, incidentally, I used to teach with—and she is certainly supportive of being involved. There are some other possibilities where we could increase the use, such as a community farm. I know there are some on the north side that have done well. We could probably do it better on the south side! We also need to preserve the bird habitats—perhaps bring in some twitchers from around the world; and maintain the open spaces and paths so that local people can use them, including me and my son—we go for bike rides there. We also need to limit vehicle access as much as possible in the defined area, but also make sure there is plenty of parking there for people who will perhaps come from all around Australia to see this unique area; and improve the access from the eastern and southern parts of the sites. As I said, I will be consulting extensively with my community, with the local government, with the state government and with the environment minister.
