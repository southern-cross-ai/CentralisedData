        On this momentous day, when the

        has been brought back to the Australian construction industry, I rise today to speak about one of my younger constituents, Rebecca Kale of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">

        . Rebecca is a bright young woman who, like many other students across Australia, has just completed her year 12 studies. On top of what is already a busy and challenging year for students, Rebecca has been selected to participate in the national finals of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Youth Australia's Evatt Competition in Sydney next week. Rebecca wrote to me to advise me of her selection, and I was very pleased to hear she had such an active interest in the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        and, more broadly, international diplomacy.

        UN Youth Australia's Evatt Competition is a model

         UN Security Council
        </a>
        diplomacy competition for students in years 9 to 12. It aims to educate our young Australians about the role we have on the world stage and assists in developing strong public speaking, research, negotiation and diplomatic skills. I encourage the involvement of all young Australians in foreign policy and I am very pleased that Rebecca will be doing the electorate of Swan very proud next week as she takes her place in the finals. I would like to take the opportunity to formally congratulate Rebecca in the House and wish her all the very best for next week as she puts her diplomacy and debating skills to work. I would also like to wish her well as she takes on the next exciting chapter of her life. We might even see her in this chamber one day!
