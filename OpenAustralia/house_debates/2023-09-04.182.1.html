        Recent media reports reveal a staggering statistic back home in

         Western Australia

        . Over half of all Western Australians have lost faith in the WA Labor government's ability to fix our health crisis. Three months have passed since

        became premier, yet our health system remains broken—that's after almost 6½ years of Labor government. It's time for Premier Cook to face reality.

They went to the election with a commitment of $152 million to upgrade the hospital, and we're yet to see anything. Now we learn of delays in the transition from private hands into public hands. In the latest update on the hospital upgrade, we were given bureaucratic speak about how the staff engagement group has been established to provide connection and learning and all the rest of it. What we need to see is real action from this Labor government now.
