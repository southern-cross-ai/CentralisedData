        While campaigning for the Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        Voice, I had the great privilege to speak alongside a Bondi Indigenous leader, Gene Ross. Something he said stuck with me: 'We have 65,000 years of the longest continuous culture and 235 years of European settlement. That isn't 65,000 years or 235 years. It is not about one or the other. It's about recognising the sum of these times: 65,000 plus 235.' Gene's generosity is typical of the Aboriginal leaders I worked with over the campaign. I am heartbroken for them, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for the tens of thousands of 'yes' volunteers, including 800 in Wentworth.

        The referendum arose out of a request from Indigenous people to be recognised in the Constitution through the Voice. They didn't ask for symbolic recognition; they wanted a recognition that would make a practical difference in their lives. I'm proud that Wentworth answered that call and tried to deliver that recognition.
       </p>

        I have three reflections from the weekend. Firstly, what an honour it has been to work alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on this campaign. Secondly, it is clear that Australia desperately needs to improve how we conduct elections and referendums so Australians can rely on truth from the media and from their leaders. Finally, the goal of the Voice, to make a practical difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is more important than ever. With or without the Voice, closing the gap is a massive challenge. This task is now all of ours to accomplish. We cannot continue to fail.
