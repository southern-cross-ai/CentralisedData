       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government has cut 10 additional Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions introduced by the coalition through the Better Access initiative to support those experiencing increased mental health pressure. I'm deeply concerned about the impact that slashing this subsidised access to psychology sessions will have on my Redlands community, which is already severely underserviced when it comes to all levels of mental health support.
       </p>
       <p>
        A local mum recently wrote to me about the additional cost that this has created to get her 17-year-old son the help that he needs. She wrote: 'Mental health in this country is a huge problem and unfortunately only getting worse day by day. Cancelling these extra sessions is going to put a strain on the already overcrowded public services, and our already extremely high suicide rate will rise.' I couldn't agree more with this mother's assessment, and I was disgusted to see the minister dismiss these concerns when asked about them in question time last week.

        My Redlands community was set to get a welcome boost to local services when the former, coalition government committed $3.4 million over four years to establish and operate a Head to Health adult mental health service at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        satellite hospital. This location was selected after a rigorous process of assessment. Unfortunately, this Labor government has sent the project back to the drawing board and is refusing to provide answers on whether the project will proceed. I'm calling on the government to restore these subsidised services and to give certainty to the Redland Bay Head to Health facility.
