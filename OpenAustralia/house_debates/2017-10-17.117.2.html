        In dealing with a foreign power like China, Australia needs to balance its commercial interests with its national security and democratic ethos. A recent report by the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States said:

        According to a recent

        front page, donations amounting to $6 million over the last five years were made by the Beijing-influenced business front the APPRC. The head of the APPRC, Mr Huang Xiangmo, withdrew $400,000 from the opposition when Labor supported Australian naval patrols in the

        Of course, we value

        and investment from China, which is now our leading trading partner, but fears about prospective damage to Australian trade or investment by China must not deter us from clear-eyed opposition to Beijing's political intervention, such as its buying control of almost the entire local Chinese language press. The Foreign Investment Review Board reports that in the financial years 2010-11 to 2015-16 there was $169 billion of investment in Australia from China. Investment rose from $16.91 billion in financial year 2010-11 to $47 billion in financial year 2015-16. This is nothing to be alarmed about, but there are pitfalls to such investment.

        . Striking the right balance, however, a state based interest in China won a 25 per cent interest in the successful bid of $9.7 billion for a 50-year lease of the

        . The $169 billion investment in Australia over the past five years is the big picture. It debunks the alarmism of comrades Drysdale and Denton in the
        <i>
         Financial Review
        </i>
        that 'opportunities will be squandered if Australian policy towards China is bungled'. Investors and traders from China are treated fairly and are not scapegoated. They are judged on commercial and national interests, the same as other investors.

        Attempts to influence local academia are less easily countered. Even before Frances Adamson, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, put this issue on the front page, Professor Allan Fitzgerald, in an

        essay 'Red pen on academic freedom', argued, 'Universities jeopardise intellectual integrity when they collaborate with Chinese institutions that do not share a commitment to liberal values or open inquiry.' It's a bit like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Lord_Nelson" rel="nofollow">

        putting his blind eye to the telescope to claim that China is an upholder of international rules based order. Beijing flouts the international law peacefully sought by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        to stop the militarisation of the

        Canberra's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will recommend, and I believe the parliament will endorse, the banning of foreign donations to parties. The Foreign Investment Review Board will continue to prevent imbroglios like the sale of the port of Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Beijing's interference in universities, think tanks, institutes and parties will be subject to media and parliamentary scrutiny. Nervous Nellies who advocate a hands-off policy for investments in China should be reassured that commercial arrangements will continue to prosper, but pro-Beijing academic and business interests should never override Australia's national security, firmly rooted in our
