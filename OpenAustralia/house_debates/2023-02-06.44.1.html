       <p>
        I rise to speak about an amazing 15-year-old man in my electorate of Robertson, Jonte Wicks, who has suffered some challenging hurdles in his young life but has persevered through these obstacles and shown us all his truth strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 26 October 2021, while he was riding his bike through the suburb of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
         East Gosford
        </a>
        , Jonte was tragically hit by a motorist and sustained significant injuries to his body and brain. Jonte lost a range of functions, including his ability to read, interpret information, participate in conversation and perform simple tasks, like making a sandwich. Jonte lost his hand-eye coordination and he was unable to play any sport, which was such a big part of his life at the time. Jonte was also unable to attend school, which further isolated him from his friends and his social life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fast forward to the present day in 2023, and Jonte is making an excellent recovery and demonstrating immense strength. He is now back at school at

        </a>
        and quickly showing his immediate circle of friends and family that he will not let this accident affect him further. Although Jonte still manages fatigue, stress and ongoing concussion, he's showing great signs of progress in his recovery. Just recently, Jonte showed that his recovery is in full swing by being awarded the Toby Martin Scholarship in cricket.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish Jonte and his family all the best in the future and look forward to hearing about his continuing recovery and progress.
