        This evening I want to set out the case for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        2050 plan. This would be an accompaniment to the peninsula planning statement and legislation which are now currently being developed by the state government of Victoria under the leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         David Morris
        </a>
        , the member for Mornington, who is also the relevant parliamentary secretary. Let me proceed in three steps: firstly, some words about the Mornington Peninsula; secondly, the notion of the plan; and, thirdly, the broader vision. The Mornington Peninsula in my judgment is an oasis for Melbourne. It is a retreat, a place of calm, a sanctuary. It has been that way for well over 100 years. Residents of Melbourne would take the steamer to Mornington or to Sorrento and they would spend a long weekend or another period of time there. The notion, the culture and the identity of the peninsula were established then, have been maintained until now and will, I believe, be maintained for the next 100 years if we get the planning and the vision right at this moment. So it is an important juncture.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are threats to the peninsula in terms of the balance between development and maintaining its character. It has been one of Australia's outstanding examples of balanced and sustainable development. Right now, we have an opportunity to get that balance right, not just for 30 years or for 50 years but for 100 years. That means creating a legacy for our children, our grandchildren and our descendants over the next 100 years. I would say that, of all of the magnificent jewels surrounding Melbourne—the

        , the

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Macedon Ranges
        </a>
        , Kinglake, Marysville and the Dandenongs—the peninsula is perhaps the most vulnerable to the risk of losing its fundamental character if we get things wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        That brings me to the second element, which is the plan going forward. My view is that we need to establish a separate peninsula planning policy through both statement and legislation. In that respect, I welcome the Victorian government's decision to embark upon just such a process. It was a program put forward at the last state election by the relevant state members,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
         Neale Burgess
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Dixon" rel="nofollow">
         Martin Dixon
        </a>
        and David Morris. I commend them on that process. The heart of that policy would be the long-term commitment to a 70 per cent rural and 30 per cent urban mix for the peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud of the fact that my own father, who, as the relevant state member as well as the planning and local government minister, was responsible for helping to drive this proposal forward over 30 years ago. It has stood the test of time. Now it is our task to put in place a peninsula planning policy statement and legislation which will last not just for 30 years or for 50 years but for 100 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of that process, I think now is the time to develop a peninsula 2050 plan. It would stand alongside the peninsula planning statement and legislation. It is about the broader vision, and I think there are three elements to that. Firstly, we need to make sure that we protect and maintain the viability of the many rural lands across the peninsula by ensuring that they are commercially viable, that they have additional income streams from tourism related activity such as food, wine, accommodation and outdoor adventure experiences. These are critical to maintaining the breadth of the rural lots which are currently in place. I would urge flexibility in use, precisely to maintain the rural character.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, we need to establish at

        </a>
        in the United States. I simply cannot rest until that task is complete. Thirdly, and finally, in terms of the peninsula, we need to build this long-term community commitment to a 2050 vision of an ideal, balanced sanctuary—
