       </p>
       <p>
        At the outset, I thank the member for Macmillan for initiating this motion. He approached me about this and asked if I could frame some words. We also had some discussions with legal representatives for Peter Greste to make sure that we did not go against his interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I indicated in a previous contribution in relation to this matter, Peter Greste is a world-renowned journalist. He has worked on four continents and in 2011 received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Peabody Award
        </a>
        . That is an important ingredient of this reality: this person is internationally recognised, he is reputable, he is renowned for his work. In that context it is preposterous to say, as Egyptian authorities have, that because he works for Al Jazeera, which is based in Qatar, and because of Qatar's association with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" rel="nofollow">
         Muslim Brotherhood
        </a>
        , in some convoluted, irresponsible fashion, this supposedly indicates that he is supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was arrested on 29 December last and commented on 26 January, the next month, 'I have no desire to weaken Egypt nor in any way see it struggle…Our arrest doesn't seem to be about our work at all. It seems to be about staking out what the government here considers to be normal and acceptable.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously the seeming public reality is that because they engaged with the Muslim Brotherhood, because they gave them an opportunity to put their views, because they sought their interpretation of events—and they are somewhat controversial, quite frankly, in Egypt. I recall going to rallies against the previous Morsi government's measures against the Coptic minority on a number of occasions and I deplored its actions. There is some controversy about what occurred in regard to Morsi's replacement by a military led regime, so it is legitimate for reporters to go out there and ask for alternative points of view.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 29 January Egypt indicated that it would prosecute 20 Al Jazeera journalists, including Greste. Typical of world reaction was the comment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        High Commissioner for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        on 1 February, 'We urge the Egyptian authorities to promptly release all journalists imprisoned for carrying out legitimate news reporting activities in exercise of their fundamental human rights.' There are grave questions about the way this whole case has been conducted. There was a 22-minute report on the arrest and interrogation with sci-fi film music in the background. There was the question of photoshopped pictures of Greste with high ranking Egyptian government officials, images of cars on a bridge and a documentary produced by Greste on a very controversial issue—soccer!
       </p>
       <p>
        The conviction was widely condemned by Western media and governments.

        ern studies, Mat Hardy, said that the reality was that there would be only be one outcome: 'Once the case started moving it didn't matter what evidence was presented.'

         William Hague
        </a>
        , said, 'Egypt should review unacceptable sentences against Egyptian and international journalists and show commitment to freedom of the press.' Similarly, the Secretary of State in the United States, John Kerry, said, 'The conviction and chilling, draconian sentences by the Cairo Criminal Court of three Al Jazeera journalists…lacked many fundamental norms of due process, is a deeply disturbing setback to Egypt's transition.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The wide-ranging allegations remind me somewhat of a book I am reading at the moment—Jacek Hugo-Bader's book
        <i>
         Kolyma Diaries:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Journey" rel="nofollow">

        <i>

        </i>
        . In that there is a person who was sentenced to 20 years jail under article 58 of the Soviet measures because he, as a student leader, was approached by other students to look at a program they had, a political program. He was then jailed for 20 years under three provisions—terrorism, group activity and anti-Soviet agitation. I am afraid that some of the allegations against Greste and co. would seem to be those wide-ranging comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that on 10 September the Egyptian Ambassador to Australia, Dr Hassan El-Laithy, commented, 'I hope when the procedures come to an end, in the courts, everything will be cleared, that's what I really hope for, I hope that he will be reunited with his family, sooner rather than later. And I assure you that this is the real position—we hope to see him back home.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I think the Australian parliament, regardless of political views, regardless of the level of activity on human rights, regardless of members' interests in international matters, is united in the need for this to happen. We are also somewhat reassured by comments on 7 July by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Egypt" rel="nofollow">
         President of Egypt
        </a>
        saying, 'I wished they were deported right after they were arrested instead of getting put on trial.' So between the lines there is some hope. I am pleased to join with the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">

        and others today in calling for Australia to raise this matter in every international fora possible.

         </small>
         <p>
          I am happy to second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to speak on this motion today with a heavy heart. On the day of Peter Greste's sentencing, 23 June, I introduced a motion to this place commending the government for their continued representations on his behalf. I acknowledge that my colleagues from all sides joined with me in the hope of a just and proper outcome; however, this was not the case. Unfortunately, on this occasion justice was denied. Being a journalist is not a crime; telling the truth is not terrorism. I spoke with Peter's parents, Lois and Juris, following the sentencing and they assured me that they and Peter were not giving up and that they would appeal and make every possible effort. The Australian government has not given up either and continues to take up opportunities to raise this case with the Egyptian government and authorities.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a result of the large number of official representations already made on Peter's case since December 2013, the government is confident that Egyptian authorities are fully aware of the importance of this case. The foreign minister has assured me that the Australian Embassy in Cairo will continue to provide consular assistance to Peter, and this includes regular visits. Unfortunately, Peter Greste's case must exhaust all legal processes before a pardon or presidential clemency can even be raised.
         </p>
         <p>
          There have been a number of instances where our government has made representations to the Egyptian authorities, and the government has made it clear that it supports an expedited appeal process so that this case can be finally resolved and so that Peter can be allowed to return home to his family. From Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Foreign Affairs Minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
           Julie Bishop
          </a>
          and Attorney-General Senator Brandis to senior bureaucrats, including Australia's Ambassador to Egypt, Dr Ralph King, all have continued to make representations at the highest levels on behalf of Peter Greste. Obviously not all the behind-the-scenes works are for public discussion. Prime Minister Abbott spoke by telephone to the then interim President Mansour on 27 March, expressed his appreciation for the President's letter to Mr Greste's parents and sought assistance from the President to bring about an early resolution of the case and Mr Greste's release.
         </p>
         <p>
          The case of Peter Greste is incredibly concerning. A free press is in every person's and every country's interests. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          A free press will help every country, including Egypt, to be better in the months and years ahead and obviously a free press is not compatible with harassing journalists going about their ordinary business.
         </p>
         <p>
          The trial of Peter Greste has also received notable international reactions. In January the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

           John Kerry
          </a>
          , said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We have consistently expressed our serious concern about the limits on freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt …
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          again urges all sides to condemn and prevent violence and to move towards an inclusive political process based on the rule of law and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all Egyptians.
         </p>

           Human Rights
          </a>
          has also called for the release of Mr Greste. A spokesperson for the high commissioner said that the arrest was based on 'vague charges', was of great concern and had increased fears among the general media. In a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          said that the tension was 'of deep concern' to the administration: 'We have strongly urged the Egyptian government to drop these charges.'
         </p>
         <p>
          With the ongoing appeal process, I think I can speak for all Australians when I say we are hopeful for a positive outcome, and our hearts go out to Lois and Juris and their family during this tough time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Journalism is an honourable profession. We rely on the integrity of journalists as a primary source of our information—information upon which we base judgements and decisions. We rely on the courage of journalists who report from troubled places, who place their lives at risk to report the facts. Peter Greste is a journalist of integrity, a journalist of courage. He is a constant reminder of the importance of freedom of speech, particularly in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East

          . I am honoured to stand today beside my colleagues from all sides of politics to demonstrate our united and unwavering support for Peter and his colleagues. I look forward to the day when we can welcome Peter Greste to this place and thank him for his courage and integrity. I commend the motion to the House.

          <p>
           I rise to support the important motion moved by the member for Werriwa and commend him for moving it. In most democracies the media and the judiciary are two parts of a single story. The best of these institutions are motivated by the same objective: the pursuit of truth in the interests of all the people. Nations function best when the press and the justice system serve to strengthen not weaken each other. But when these institutions fail, and if they are pitted against each other, if one or other is compromised, freedom and justice are threatened and contaminated. It is real, honest, innocent people who can be the victims. So it was in the appalling and heart-wrenching case of Peter Greste in Egypt this year.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the member for Werriwa mentioned, Peter is a distinguished journalist with more than 25 years of experience working for an array of high-quality agencies, including Reuters,

           , Chile, Mexico, Belarus, Afghanistan, Kenya, Somalia and most recently, of course, in Egypt. It was in this last location that Peter became a news story himself, as the injustice and unfairness that he suffered at the hands of the Egyptian judicial system was disseminated around the world.

          <p>
           Accused and convicted of spreading false news and conspiring against certain powerful groups in Egypt, he was shamefully sentenced in June this year to seven years in prison just for doing his job as a journalist. What is more, the process that led to his arrest and conviction, along with that of his two other colleagues from Al Jazeera, was fraught with procedural irregularities and extraordinary breaches of the principles that underlie any just and reasonable system of law. Throughout this whole process, the government and the opposition here in Australia have been united in condemnation of the miscarriage of justice that is the Peter Greste case. At what must be an awful time for his family, for his parents and for his brothers, Mike and Andrew, who live here in Australia, our hearts go out to them. We have no alternative but to maintain hope that the appeal lodged in August will be successful and that Peter will be granted freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
           We all heard the words of Egypt's envoy to Australia that Peter will be back home in Brisbane sooner rather than later, and many of us were encouraged by them, although we have learned over the past few months not to get our hopes up. Our message to the Greste family must be that the Australian parliament will stand with them for as long as it takes to free their beloved son and brother. Peter Greste's brother Andrew wrote an article recently in
           <i>
            The

           </i>
           . He described how, throughout most of his professional career, the idea of constitutionally enshrined press freedom was just an abstract principle. It is an important principle but it is not an abstract one. It needs to be protected and advanced. It needs constant attention.

           In many countries, freelance journalists and foreign correspondents risk their lives every day to maintain our awareness of the situations unfolding throughout the world. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, we have seen 36 journalists killed on the job around the world this year. We have seen the shocking and deplorable public executions of Steven Sotloff and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Foley" rel="nofollow">
            James Foley
           </a>
           in Syria that haunted televisions around the world. And there have been less-well-publicised but equally devastating murders in Iraq, Israel, Ukraine, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico and Africa. Each and every death, and each and every journalist who lives in fear of harm or detention, is a tragedy for the profession and a tragedy for all of us who depend on their work for information and for knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Labor Party believes fundamentally in the freedom of journalists to be able to do their work, as does, I think, every member in this place—and I commend the member for Ryan for her remarks a moment ago. We will continue to stand beside Peter and his family, and all the journalists who risk their lives in the course of their important work. They should never be imprisoned or harmed for doing their job and for reporting the news. That is why this is an important motion moved by the member for Werriwa, and that is why I am proud to support it.

            I would also like to acknowledge the member for Werriwa and thank him for bringing this important motion to the parliament. I rise to speak in support of this motion. Peter Greste has a distinguished career with a number of media organisations working right across the world. His plight first came to my attention in December when his brother Andrew, who is a constituent of mine and is a farmer out near
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Waa" rel="nofollow">
             Wee Waa
            </a>
            , sent me an email outlining the situation that his brother Peter was in. At that time, I contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
             Julie Bishop
            </a>
            . I understand that, in a myriad of ways, Australia has been endeavouring to help Peter Greste return home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peter Greste graduated in journalism from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
             University of Queensland
            </a>
            . He has worked everywhere from regional Victoria to Afghanistan. The respect that his colleagues have shown for him throughout the trial has been an accurate indication of the regard in which he is held. Mr Greste is no stranger to tragedy, and indeed in 2005 he witnessed his producer,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Peyton" rel="nofollow">
             Kate Peyton
            </a>
            , being killed by being shot in the back outside their hotel in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. In reflection on her death, he said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We were working together on the story, just the two of us, and we both knew what we were getting into.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It was a risk we both judged to be worth taking, if only because so few reporters have been into Somalia in the past decade, and nobody can hope to make a considered judgment of either Africa or Islamic extremism without understanding why that country has remained so anarchic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peter had only been in Egypt for two weeks when he was arrested in his hotel room. Since his arrest his legal team have announced to the public that they have lodged an appeal against his conviction. At the moment we do not have any clear idea about the time lines for this appeal process. This is obviously distressing not only for Peter Greste but for his entire family. Mr Greste is receiving regular visits from consular officials in Cairo and we will continue to provide support to Mr Greste. Mr Greste's parents, who have been based in Cairo since late June, have also been able to visit Peter and I would like to also comment on the great courage and dignity that Mr and Mrs Greste have shown through this incredible ordeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Australian government has, at every opportunity, expressed concern about the way in which this case has unfolded. Representations have been made to the relevant Egyptian authorities throughout Mr Greste's trial, including by the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister has said, these journalists were just doing their job. We do have to acknowledge that Mr Greste is subject to the Egyptian justice system, however frustrating that may be. The Prime Minister has publicly stated his commitment to taking all reasonable action to ensure Peter Greste and his colleagues are released as quickly as possible. The Australian government has been clear: we respect the outcome of the recent elections in Egypt, but Mr Greste's trial highlights the concern that we have about Egypt's commitment to the transition to democracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inherent to any good democracy is a free press. These sentiments have been echoed by leaders around the world including

            , Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a statement about their deep concern at the court decision of 24 June. In the statement, Secretary-General Ban described the trial as having proceedings that clearly appear not to meet the basic fair trial standards. It is clear that the Egyptian authorities are completely aware that the Australian government is seeking Mr Greste's release in order for him to return to his family as quickly as possible. We support an expeditious appeal process and we will continue to work with Mr Greste and his family throughout this process. I acknowledge the great courage that Peter Greste has shown through this horrendous ordeal and my sincere hope is that he returns to Australia sooner rather than later.

            <p>
             I rise to support this important resolution moved by the member for Werriwa—important because it is an opportunity for us to show as a parliament our absolute unity in support of Peter Greste's release and our support for freedom of the press. Peter Greste, of course, has been detained in Egypt since December of last year. Peter was charged with defaming Egypt and having ties to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" rel="nofollow">
              Muslim Brotherhood
             </a>
             . In June of this year he was convicted of these charges and sentenced to seven years in jail. Peter is detained with his colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who have also been convicted of defaming Egypt and having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Baher Mohamed was also sentenced to an additional three years in prison for possession of ammunition. This referred to a spent bullet casing he found on the ground during a protest in those tumultuous times in Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Freedom of the press is something that we take for granted here in Australia. Our governments do not always like what they read in newspapers, nor do we as parliamentarians. But we accept that openness is a part of our democracy. I welcome the idea that Egypt has gone down the path of democracy with an independent judiciary. But, when a journalist simply going about his duties finds himself breaking the law, it is very clear that Egypt has much more work to do to adopt all of the institutions that are essential to democracy. I find it unfortunate that the Egyptian government cites one of these institutions, the independence of the judiciary, to justify its failure to protect another: the freedom of the press.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no doubt that the work of journalists, particularly in the zones that Peter Greste worked in, is challenging and takes great courage. It is courage based upon the principle that people have a right to know what is going on in the world. Every day journalists place their own safety behind the principle of getting access to information and informing the citizenry of what is occurring. Around the world, many journalists—too many journalists—are killed each year or imprisoned for simply doing their job. The Peter Greste case brings home to Australia that this is the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a fact that, as

             </a>
             said, you cannot limit freedom of the press without destroying it. What we have here is a case where that freedom of the press is being restricted. The press are being intimidated by the fact that not just Peter Greste but also his colleagues from

             have gone through what has been described as a farcical trial. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance report that according to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation" rel="nofollow">

             of Journalists 88 journalists and media workers have been killed so far this year. That is an extraordinary figure! It is an extraordinary figure which shows the danger that people put themselves in.

             This is not a trial for these defendants alone—this is a trial of all journalists.

            <p>
             Our entire parliament stands, as well as with Peter Greste, with the Greste family, who have shown such courage. On behalf of the opposition, we give every support to the government in its endeavours to ensure Peter Greste's early release.

              I rise to add my voice to those of my parliamentary colleagues who have today shared their concern and frustration that Australian journalist Peter Greste remains behind bars in Egypt's Tora prison. I heartily welcome this opportunity to ensure Australia and the international community do not stop fighting for Mr Greste's freedom. As we have heard, Mr Greste was erroneously found guilty of spreading false news and supporting the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" rel="nofollow">
               Muslim Brotherhood
              </a>
              . He was sentenced to seven years in jail. As a former television journalist myself for many years, I was shocked by both the conviction and the severity of the sentence. This shock has resonated with journalists and foreign correspondents around the world. To describe this finding as unjust is a monumental understatement.
             </p>
             <p>
              Peter Greste is a man who was simply doing his job: reporting the facts with integrity and with balance, without fear or favour. He was also, and is, a journalist of great distinction and courage. His track record speaks for itself. Mr Greste was not pushing any agenda other than that of a reporter seeking to report the truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1991, Mr Greste first left Australia to pursue his dreams of becoming a foreign correspondent. He had a long and notable career reporting from conflict zones, shining a light on some of the most disturbing aspects of humanity. He spent time working across Africa, the

              . Notably, he reported from Kabul on the emergence of the Taliban. He returned to report from Afghanistan after 9/11. Mr Greste has also spent time in places including Bosnia, Mexico, Chile, Kenya and Tanzania. He moved to Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast in 2004, where he became a freelancer.

              In 2011, as we have heard, he won a prestigious

              <i>
               Somalia: Land of Anarchy
              </i>
              . Six years earlier, his producer,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Peyton" rel="nofollow">
               Kate Peyton
              </a>
              , was shot dead while they were reporting from Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. It shows the absolute courage and determination of the man that he would return to the scene of such an horrendous incident to complete the report they had been working on together. Peter Greste said later of Ms Peyton's death:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I was with her when she was shot. We were working together on the story, just the two of us, and we both knew what we were getting into. It was a risk we both judged to be worth taking, if only because so few reporters have been into Somalia in the past decade, and nobody can hope to make a considered judgement of either Africa or Islamic extremism without understanding why that country has remained so anarchic. So when I am asked who cares what happens at a dusty, poverty stricken, anarchic backwater on a corner of Africa, the answer is as simple as it is obvious: Kate Peyton cared.
             </p>
             <p>
              Peter Greste laid bare the confronting truths about Somalia for the world to see, as he did in Egypt. Today I call on the Egyptian authorities to do the right thing and to release Mr Greste and his colleagues immediately. As we have heard, he was jailed along with Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our government will continue to take all opportunities to raise this case with the Egyptian government. The government has made clear that it supports an expeditious appeal process, so that this case can be finally resolved and Mr Greste allowed to return home to his family. The

              in Cairo will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Greste, including visiting him on regular occasions. I commend foreign affairs minister,

              , and Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the way they have handled this terrible situation. They, along with other Australian authorities and officials, have been making numerous representations to the Egyptian authorities.

              We must now wait for the appeal to come before the court. We—of course, all parliamentarians here in Australia—are incredibly hopeful of a more favourable outcome. Egypt must realise that a free press is a crucial element to a democracy. I urge the court to make the right decision and send Mr Greste home to his family.
