       <p>
        Australians look after their mates, whether that's on the battlefield, during the bushfires, or right now as we fight the economic and social impacts of coronavirus. Today I want to focus on the people of Stirling and how they came together to serve each other. I and my office staff have found it personally rewarding to have established our Coronavirus Care Campaign, linking locals who want to volunteer with organisations who need support. To date, over 100 people have signed up to the campaign. Well done to Hiten and the team at

        , who have been delivering free meals to people in self-quarantine and to frontline workers since week one. The local Indian community have continued their passion for service, supported by leaders like Indian Society WA President Supriya Guha and past president Surya Ambati, as well as Jim Seth and Amit Khullar, leading by their personal example of giving.

        Community Services have also ramped up their support services at this time of need. Alongside all of these organisations there have been people who have responded to our call for volunteers under this campaign.

       <p>
        From me, from my team, and, most importantly, from the community of Stirling, we offer you today our very warmest and heartfelt thanks.
