        My question is to the Prime Minister. Would Australia be closer to reopening if the Prime Minister had not failed his two jobs on vaccine and quarantine?

         I thank the member for his question, because he's made this reference once more, implying that the Prime Minister of this country only has two jobs. As I said before, anyone who thinks a prime minister of this country only has two jobs isn't up to the job. I can say that because those of us who have been dealing with one of the most serious situations that we have had to address during our time of government—that is, to seek the evacuation of what has almost been 1,700 people out of Kabul right now—would understand that a prime minister at any given time has more than two jobs. That matter is the one that we have been particularly applied on in this most recent week. And I want to thank again those Australians on the ground in Kabul right now doing that very important job at one of most sensitive times of the mission that they have.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, as we continue to move forward and deal with those issues, as we have continued to have done that over these many months—with 430 individuals, Afghans and their families, brought to this country well before this crisis even hit in the most recent iteration and now we have moved into that evacuation mode—we have continued to reduce taxes on those working in this country and we have continued with the many jobs. It is inferred by those opposite—

                 Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government have continued to implement our plans and our response to the COVID pandemic, which has seen us save 30,000 lives, with the help of Australians and their sacrifices all around the country, and has ensured that a million Australians have been able to get back to work and be supported in those jobs. Even as we've gone through these lockdowns, we've been able to continue to support them with support payments, over $3 billion, which have been paid out to support people to get through these lockdowns. These are the important tasks as we continue through the COVID pandemic—and, importantly, the national plan that ensures that at 70 per cent and 80 per cent we will be able to live with this virus. That means we need to adjust our mindset, and all of us need to support Australians to adjust their mindset, as we go into these additional phases of this plan.
                </p>
