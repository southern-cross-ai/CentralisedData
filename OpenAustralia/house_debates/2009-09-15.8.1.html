        I refer the Prime Minister to his answer to my previous question and to his going on television earlier this year to urge Australians to invest in the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        , which he said would be commercially viable. Will the Prime Minister, having had some time to think about it, now answer these questions: what will it cost, how many subscribers will it have, what will they be asked to pay, and, if it is going to be able to pay interest on the bonds you are urging people to buy in it, what will its net revenues be?

          I am always taken by these questions asked by the opposition about broadband, given that they seem to be so spectacularly anchored in the past when this government is seeking to invest in the nation’s future.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
           Can I
          </a>
          say to the honourable gentleman opposite that, when you are about to embark upon the single largest infrastructure project in Australia’s history, you plan it thoroughly and you work with your private sector partners, or prospective private sector partners, in that project. On top of that, you also get your regulatory regime right.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would draw the honourable member’s attention to what he conspicuously does not ask about today, which is the fundamental reform of telecommunications in this country, as indicated by the release of the telecommunications legislation amendment bill 2009. If the honourable member suggests that it is possible to unfold every aspect of the details of this proposed infrastructure investment for the future in the absence of the regulatory reforms necessary, which involve those which go to the heart of Telstra’s current near monopoly, then he demonstrates how out of touch and ignorant he is of these matters.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have taken this decision based on the absolute best of Treasury advice. We will proceed with the implementation of this critical missing link in Australia’s productivity for the future. It is the right infrastructure for the future. We will proceed methodically, carefully, consistently through the implementation of this to deal with the conspicuous gap in infrastructure which those opposite left behind for 12 long years.
