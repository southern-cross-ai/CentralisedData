        Today is R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">

        ? Day. It's an important day that encourages all of us, individually, to take the time to start a meaningful conversation with someone we're worried about or who is doing it particularly tough at the moment. This important suicide prevention awareness day was launched back in 2009, by Gavin Larkin, who sadly passed away in 2011. Fittingly, last week's

        shone an important light on Gavin and the work he carried out to make sure R U OK? Day had a strong future, and, eight years on, this is exactly what has happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Maher" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , R U OK? has gone from strength to strength. I was lucky enough to be part of R U OK? conversation convoy that went around Australia recently. It is landing in Cairns today; its destination is up there in Queensland at the end of its convoy. But it did visit Hobart. It started on 1 August and it's been going for six weeks, travelling 14,000 kilometres, visiting over 20 communities, including many Indigenous communities, right around Australia. The most powerful message delivered by R U OK? during the convoy is that we all have what it takes to start that conversation if we're worried about someone who is doing it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are four simple steps that can make a difference to someone who is having a tough time. The first is to ask: 'Are you okay? I've noticed you've not been yourself lately. Is there anything troubling you?' The second step is to listen to what they say. The third is to encourage action. Ask them, 'Have you thought about talking to your
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        ? Is there anybody else you can talk to? Is there something I can help you with?' But don't put too much pressure on them. Then check in a few days later or a week later, and ask, 'Are you really okay? Did you do what we said last week? Is there anything further I can do to help?'
       </p>
       <p>
        It's really important that we take time to reconnect with people and encourage others to do the same, not just on this day but every day. With an increasing number of Australians experiencing mental ill-health, and, of course, the increasing suicide rate, there is a changing attitude across Australia that more needs to be done to address mental health and suicide. As a community we are talking more about our mental health, and this is a good thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the statistics are concerning. Every day in Australia, more than eight people die by suicide. These are not statistics; they're individualsâ€”every single day. They have parents, brothers, sisters, and other family members, lovers, friends, work colleagues and classmates. This is a national tragedy and we need to do better. We can do better, we should do better and we all need to do better, and we can start by taking the time today to ask somebody we care about, 'Are you okay?' and doing that every single day.
