        Today I rise to speak about homelessness in my community and the incredible work that Rosie's in Southport does to help those in need. I had the experience of going to Rosie's a few weeks ago to see firsthand what they do and how they do it. Every day, the team open their doors to 50 to 80 people who have slept rough. They come to have a shower, a coffee and a hot breakfast, and for a listening ear. The coordinator, Rosanne, said that these three things are important in the morning, because they start the day off on the right foot. It was great to meet with the volunteers who give up their time to cook eggs, fish and chips on the barbecue. Across the road, Beck and Carla were at the

        , offering tea, coffee and biscuits and extending their kindness to anyone under stress before their matter came before the courts. These selfless volunteers create a safe zone for many in the community who are struggling. They form friendships to help overcome loneliness, which is a difficult part of being homeless.

        Whilst homelessness is a complex issue, it's also vital to recognise there are organisations and governments doing good things in this space. The Morrison government understands that housing is integral to the welfare of every person. That's why we're contributing more than $6 billion a year to support the states and territories. Sadly, in Queensland, a lack of homes continues to be an issue. The Queensland state government has the second-lowest number of public housing dwellings in the country, at 10.3 per 1,000 people. It's important to remember that, while the federal government is doing everything possible to address homelessness, this is a state responsibility, so the Queensland state government needs to step up and deliver more to address this growing issue. I'm determined to work alongside the organisations in my electorate to make a difference.
