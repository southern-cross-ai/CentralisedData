         I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. Last night in the House the government’s renewable energy legislation was passed, and that was an extremely important development. The opposition was endeavouring to take a more constructive approach to that legislation—which was welcome—and to appear more constructive on environment issues. Indeed, it was endeavouring to demonstrate that there is some concern on that side about the issue of climate change. However, a fundamental test in this matter is to see this legislation successfully passed through the Senate into law so that the government can pursue and implement the target of 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply coming from renewable sources by 2020. Interestingly, however, it appears that even this issue is not so simple on the coalition side of politics, because there are reports that there was vigorous debate about the approach of the coalition in the party room discussion today. We are happy to see the member for Flinders making it into the chamber safely this afternoon, as we understand that there was a fair bit of anger directed towards the shadow minister on this issue, the approach to be taken—

          Not too threatening. The important thing here is that this country needs to take action on both fronts: on establishing the renewable energy target legislation and on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions through the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
           Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
          </a>
          . We need consistency in national public policy making on these important issues. It is not enough to be in this place and to support, or not to oppose, the renewable energy target legislation. But, on the other side of the equation—we can all feel good about solar energy and geothermal and wind and wave power, and support the renewable energy target—the real test is the establishment of the carbon price in this economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is going to make the contribution to shift investment away from higher-polluting industries into lower pollution forms of energy generation. The renewable energy target on its own will not achieve the billions of dollars of investment that this country needs in renewable energy sources or reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We need both institutional changes in our economy to secure this important change in the battle against climate change. We need a consistent approach in policymaking, and we need consistency from the opposition side of politics on this issue. It is critical not just to support the renewable energy legislation but also to support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation.

          There has been too much walking on both sides of the street in national politics from the coalition on a number of key issues. There is an interesting interview in relation to this approach of having it a bit both ways from the doors of

           Parliament House
          </a>
          this morning. The member for Cowan was interviewed at the doors this morning in relation to the stimulus package, and the interview is symptomatic of the approach we see from the coalition in dealing with key policy issues. They come in here, vote against the stimulus package, go out there and say it is good. The member for Cowan was asked the following by a journalist at the doors: ‘But do you believe stimulus has helped Australia out of recession?’ The member for Cowan responded, ‘Well, with that, there has been a lot of money’—

              The response by the member for Cowan to the question about the effect of the stimulus was the following: ‘Well, with that, there has been a lot of money pumped in and people have spent it. There’s no doubt about that. I have been to local retailers in my area, and they say that people over in

                     The member for Cowan in fact went on to say this in response to the question: ‘Well, money into the economy is obviously—people do actually spend money, and so there has been some consumer reaction out of that.’ The member for Cowan, along with other members of the opposition, of course, thinks it is fine to come in here and vote against the stimulus package, which is having demonstrable positive economic and employment effects, but to go out into the community and adopt an entirely different position. Consistency in politics is extremely important. You cannot, on the issue of climate change, say or present the impression that you support one leg of the institutional changes that are necessary—that is, the renewable energy target—but at the same time never get your act together to present a positive policy position on the

                     This is the most significant reform that any government has ever endeavoured to undertake, in the face of one of the greatest challenges that we face, and you cannot produce a policy. The time is coming when the coalition is going to have to overcome the divisions within its ranks, overcome the scepticism about the climate—and the member for

                       is on the record as questioning whether human activity is contributing to global warming but on the other hand is out there saying you have to give the planet the benefit of the doubt. You cannot be a sceptic on the one hand and get in touch with your green side on the other; you have to have a consistent position. It is time, in the national interest, that the coalition side of politics got their act together.
