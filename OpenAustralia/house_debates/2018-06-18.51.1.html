       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to give a shout out to the amazing organisers, volunteers and teams behind making this year's City of Logan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_For_Life" rel="nofollow">
         Relay For Life
        </a>
        such a huge success. I was very honoured to be asked to be the patron of the 2018 City of Logan Relay For Life. It meant a lot because this amazing fundraiser has become one of the great local traditions in our community, raising much-needed funds and awareness for people battling cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Held in late May, this year's event attracted 25 teams, with more than 230 participants and an additional 500 people visiting on the night. Thanks to the tremendous community effort, more than $28,000 was raised for this worthy cause. Its support is absolutely irreplaceable in the Logan community. Every year it is a pleasure to see our relay teams work together to support this amazing effort of funding cancer research. It's easy to see why Relay For Life gets so much support each and every year. In addition to that, there are many local community groups who also hold Biggest Morning Tea events to raise funds for cancer research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone knows somebody affected by cancer. When somebody we love is diagnosed it unites friends, families and communities, and this is why this fundraising is so important to provide those support services. Thanks to everyone involved.
