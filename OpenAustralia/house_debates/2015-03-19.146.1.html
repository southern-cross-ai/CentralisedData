        We are just over a month away from a very significant day in our nation's historyâ€”a day where, across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , tens of thousands of people will pause on the Centenary of Anzac to honour the ultimate sacrifice made by so many men and women over the past 100 years in the service of our nation. We will do this in places such as Davistown, Terrigal, Macmasters Beach and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We will also commemorate Anzac Day in Gosford, where the Gosford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-Branch is hosting a Central Coast veterans' march and a commemorative service to be held at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Stadium
        </a>
        on 18 April.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will be a landmark event on the Central Coast and will bring together Gosford's history with our nation's history. Before and after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        , the town of Gosford was a centre of commerce, with citrus and vegetable products brought in along the railway line, adjacent to where we will be meeting on the 18th, and taken to warehouses in surrounding farms. Many of these men and women who worked in Gosford and on the farms were enlisted to serve. As we sadly know, many never returned. This event will recognise how this shared history shaped our region. I acknowledge the tireless work of Greg Mawson,

        , Len Sargent and Patsy Edwards.

        I am also pleased to announce today that this major event will receive more than $40,000 from the government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The Davistown RSL Sub-Branch has also received a grant, with over $15,000 towards what I know will be a moving service at the Davistown

        </a>
        and Wal Sheargold have done an outstanding job in organising a dawn service which is also expected to attract thousands of locals from our community. Their engagement with schools in the Davistown area has been vital in educating the Central Coast about the Anzac Centenary. It is great to see that all students who attend will receive a special commemorative medallion. Davistown RSL Club are also supporting some of the events being prepared by Terrigal Wamberal RSL Sub-Branch which is receiving more than $29,000 as part of the grants program.

        At dawn on Terrigal Beach, there will be a re-enactment of the Gallipoli landing performed by 12 boats from the Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club. There are many other events organised by this sub-branch as well as other organisations, with the Central Coast primary schools choir, an exhibition at the Breakers Country Club and some readings from local school students. This significant event in our community is thanks to

        I also acknowledge the life of Mick Waddell, a former President of Terrigal Wamberal RSL Sub-Branch, who tragically passed away in December. He gave tirelessly and willingly of his time and friendship to all who knew him and he is greatly missed. May he rest in peace.
