       <p>
        On indulgence, I want to take this brief opportunity to advise the House on Australian assistance to the people of Fiji in the wake of the recent cyclone and the declaration of a state of natural disaster. Yesterday the interim Fiji government requested assistance from Australia. Whatever differences we may have with the interim government of Fiji, we have no difference with the people of Fiji and no difficulty in continuing to render humanitarian assistance to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night I decided, on behalf of the government, to allocate as an initial contribution $1 million of assistance to the people of Fiji, and this morning an Australian Defence Force C130 aircraft left the Richmond air base carrying emergency relief supplies such as tents, tarpaulins, water, water purification equipment, blankets and the like. Three AusAID officials are on the plane to assist in the distribution of that humanitarian response in coordination with Fiji officials. In addition to the transportation of the emergency relief and supplies, the C130 will be available tomorrow to survey damaged areas in the east of Fiji and to provide part of the damage assessment. As part of the $1 million we will also be providing funding to Fijiâ€™s National Disaster Management Office to enable it to charter helicopters and boats to deliver supplies to remote communities, and we are also funding the Fiji Red Cross to enable local purchase of emergency supplies. This is an initial response and we are open to a further response when further detailed assessments come in.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are doing this in cooperation and in conjunction with our friends in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . Last night I spoke to Foreign Minister McCully, and New Zealand have made a comparable and similar announcement today so far as their response is concerned. We also stand ready, willing and able to help with any long-term reconstruction. I can also advise the House that at this stage we have no indication whatsoever of any Australians having been caught up in the cyclone itself. I thank the House.

        <p>
         On indulgence, the coalition supports the actions of the government in responding to the official request from the government of Fiji to provide humanitarian assistance for those in Fiji affected by the recent cyclone. We understand that the Australian government and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         government are coordinating the effort. We note that to date the Australian government has offered $1 million in practical assistance, such as tarpaulins and water equipment and the like, and we assume that the government will be monitoring the situation should more aid be required, in which case we assume that the minister will return to the House or put out a statement to that effect.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our condolences go to those who have been affected in Fiji by the destruction and devastation of the cyclone.
