        I previously spoke of my high regard for the Girls’ Brigade companies located within the electorate of Cowan. Today I would like to speak on the 3rd Perth company located in Greenwood. On Sunday 24 May I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        in Greenwood for the usual 9 am service. I did so in order to formally recognise the great volunteer work of the leaders of the 3rd company.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls" rel="nofollow">
         The Girls

        ’ Brigades have a rich history of supporting and guiding girls and young women in life skills consistent with the Christian faith.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the service I had the chance to acknowledge the dedication and effort of the leaders of the Girls’ Brigade. The captain of the 3rd company is Elisabeth Stokes. The leaders and auxiliary helpers are

        , Jacqui Sanders, Aimee Burnenshaw,

        , Sarah Sanders, Jessica Ross, Alexandria York and Laura Dunstall. Given that the youngest of these volunteers is just 17 years old, the future of the Girls’ Brigade is assured. Indeed, as I looked around the church community, I was sure of the future leadership of the Girls’ Brigade and its volunteers. Given the great number of girls at the church, the future of the Girls’ Brigade seems very positive.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to the large number of young people in the church, it was clear to me that it provides for the needs of its community. This was epitomised by the upbeat yet appropriate spiritual music and the highly relevant sermons. It is little wonder that the church was absolutely packed. I thank the minister of the Uniting Church,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hurst" rel="nofollow">

        , and Captain Elisabeth Stokes for allowing me to attend the service. I also acknowledge the head of the church council, Bruce MacAdam, the Reverend Tom Wilson and the entire congregation for making me feel welcome.
