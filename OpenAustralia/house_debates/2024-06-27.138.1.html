        A visit to Malvern Central School on 11 June to meet the year 5s and 6s was a joy. The students quizzed me on my role as an MP and I visited their

        , including more young people in parliament, of course. I also talked to them about leadership being about bringing people with divergent views together in a process called consensus building, which is not easy but is an essential skill for the job of running a country; why politics is becoming more risky because people can't seem to disagree respectfully; to what I did to wind down—hang out with my family and my dog, a rescue

        who we adore. I told them social media is a barrier to authentic connection, where everything is filtered, so stay off it for as long as possible was my take. If only we could take the natural curiosity of these children and put it in water. More questions in a respectful way from a place of genuine curiosity would help solve our world's problems. These children will be that bridge, supported by the outstanding teachers and a community of parents.

        Anna at St Michaels Parish School, Ashburton explained the problems girls and women face playing sport. Only 32 per cent of Australian women participate in sport. For me, playing sport is the best, but unfortunately many girls don't feel that way. The cost of playing sport is so expensive. It's not right to leave young girls out of sport because they can't afford the fees. Gender equality is important, and if girls see that boys are treated differently they are less likely to participate. Boys might get better equipment and the best grounds to play on, and it's much easier to watch men's sport.

        The Albanese Labor government agrees, which is why we stumped up $200 million for the Play Our Way initiative. This will help build better facilities like pavilions and lighting, and also provide equipment, uniforms and the hiring of coaches to increase girls participation in sport. Other initiatives include enabling Sport Integrity Australia to improve the safety of women in sport; creating pathways for female coaches by funding the Gen32 Coach Program, which is extending the course from two to three years; and continuing funding for soccer events and our national netball team, the Diamonds. We're also updating anti-siphoning broadcasting laws to protect women's sporting events like the magic Matildas' games.

        To young girls and women who like or love sports, a government that is 53 per cent women has your back.
