          I want to send my condolences to the family of former Senator Misha Lajovic, who was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 23 July 1921 and died recently, on 5 June 2008. He came to Australia at the age of 30 and worked for two years as a labourer and then as an accountant. He was in the parliament from 1975 to 1985, the first Australian of Slovenian extraction to be a member of the federal parliament. He was passionate about his Senate committee work and saw Australia as a land of opportunity. He is survived by a very loving extended family, and my regards go particularly to his son, Thomas.
         </p>
         <p>
          His death occurred in the same year as the passing of the former

          , who was born in Celje in Slovenia on 17 May 1950 and died in 2008 aged 57. He is survived by a son and a daughter, and his sister Helena Drnovsek Zorko was the charge dâ€™affaires from Slovenia to Australia and a great friend of the Australian community. President Drnovsek was well loved in Slovenia and played a key role in the post-communist and post-independence era. He formed the
