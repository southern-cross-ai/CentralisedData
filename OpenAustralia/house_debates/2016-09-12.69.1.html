        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the alleged terrorism incident that occurred in Sydney on Saturday afternoon, and what steps the government has taken to keep all Australians safe?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday, we remembered the devastating terrorist attack of 9/11. We remembered and mourned the victims, and we mourned and honoured the victims and those who, heedless of their own lives, rushed to their aid. We were also informed, and I was briefed by my security heads, of a different but similar terrorist incident in Sydney, in Minto. Late on Saturday a 22-year-old man stabbed a 59-year-old man in the street, inflicting very, very serious injuries. The victim remains in a serious condition but he is improving. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family for a fast and complete recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         I spoke of the heroism of those who rushed to the aid of those assaulted in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Towers" rel="nofollow">
          Twin Towers
         </a>
         on 9/11. I want here today to also commend the bravery of the man who was attacked in Minto and the bravery of those citizens who helped him and supported him, including the police officers that rushed to the scene. They are true heroes, standing up with all of us in the battle against terrorism. The 22-year-old assailant has been charged with committing a terrorist act and attempted murder. The police believe, as you know, from the deputy commissioner's remarks, that the attack was inspired by Daesh propaganda. This event shows us how terrorism is evolving. We look at 9/11—an elaborate attack, planned months in advance, extremely complex. The attack on Saturday was by one person, a lone actor, inspired, it appears, by Daesh propaganda online. As Daesh is defeated in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , it will seek to do more of this. They have called for attacks like this in Australia. We have to recognise that we will see more of these. They are more likely to occur. We have to remember, however, that as these Islamist terrorists seek to divide us, we must not let them win.
        </p>
        <p>
         Security at home is always the government's highest priority. Our law enforcement and security agencies are the best in the world. We are well placed to keep our citizens secure but we have to be as agile in our response as the terrorists are in their attacks on us—and we are. We are committed to giving our agencies the laws they need, the resources they need, to keep us safe; but, above all, we must bind together in solidarity defending Australia, defending our friends and neighbours, keeping our nation safe.

           I would briefly like to join the opposition to the Prime Minister's remarks commemorating the terrible events 15 years ago but also the events of the past weekend. I completely concur with the Prime Minister's words that we live in a special community where not only the police but one's local neighbours and community will step up. I think all of us wonder how we would act in such an event, but for these people they were asked that question of themselves and they answered most commendably.
