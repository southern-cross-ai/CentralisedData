        <p>
         I thank the member for Goldstein for his question and for all his work in advocating for his constituents, who have received over $118 million in direct assistance from the Morrison government through the coronavirus supplement and, of course, the four economic support payments. It's a difficult time in Victoria, and the Morrison government continues to stand not just with Victorians but with all Australians, as we've done throughout the entire pandemic and as we'll continue to do as we chart our way through our economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the House is aware, we'll continue to provide detailed support to Australians. Through the pandemic, we've provided four economic support payments, totalling $2,000 per recipient. We've also provided payments to support 2.5 million age pensioners and 750,000 family tax benefit recipients. We've also provided $32 billion in emergency support payments. On top of that, as the Treasurer has outlined, there has been $28.1 billion in JobKeeper payments to specific Victorians. Over 300,000 entities and over a million Victorians have benefited. Likewise, $9 billion has gone to Victorians in the cash flow boost, and $5.1 billion has been paid in the coronavirus supplement.
        </p>
        <p>
         On specific issues, when it comes to mutual obligation requirements all Victorians should be aware that the Morrison government has removed mutual obligations for Victorians impacted by the COVID shutdown. Mutual obligation requirements for jobseekers in Victoria have been paused until 7 June this year. During this period, jobseekers will not incur any payment suspensions or financial penalties if they don't meet their mutual obligations. Likewise, the pandemic leave disaster payment is providing support to Victorians who are unable to earn an income because they've been directed to self-isolate or quarantine, or to people who are caring for someone who has COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         From 27 May there have been 1,700 calls that have come from Victorians, and $472,000 has been paid. It's a lump sum of $1,500 for a 14-day period to people who are at home due to the circuit-breaker lockdown. I remind all members to inform their Victorian constituents that the easiest way is to call 18002266. Likewise, people who are currently receiving an income support payment or who get Abstudy living allowance may be eligible for a crisis payment if they've been directed to self-isolate or quarantine. Again, it's a one-off payment equal to the maximum basic rate. From 27 May, 9,682 Victorians have claimed that, and I encourage all members to continue to apprise their constituents of the great support that's available.
