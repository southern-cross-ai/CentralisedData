       <p>
        I want to call out the deteriorating human rights situation in Cambodia, where the authoritarian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun_Sen" rel="nofollow">
         Hun Sen
        </a>
        regime is using COVID-19 as a cover for further abuses. On 31 July, echoing the 2017 arrest of opposition leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kem_Sokha" rel="nofollow">
         Kem Sokha
        </a>
        , Cambodian authorities descended on the home of Rong Chhun, president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions, taking him away and threatening his family with arrest. Rong Chhun now faces up to two years in prison. The regime claims his arrest was because he made comments exaggerating information, which caused a disruption to social security. This is regime code for, he said something that the government didn't like about the border negotiations with Vietnam.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Rong Chhun's real crime is being an effective unionist, upsetting crony mates of the regime. He has been advocating on behalf of thousands of workers at the Violet Apparel factory, which supplied some of the world's leading clothes brands. The factory closed in July but failed to pay workers what they are owed. Authorities have doubled down, arresting and charging Suong Sophorn, a Cambodian political leader, as well as Chhoeun Daravy and Hun Vannak, members of a local environmental youth organisation who spoke out demanding Rong Chhun's release. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        is taking action against Cambodia, and Australia must speak out and consider similar actions against the Cambodian regime and officials for their continued violations of human rights and call for these individuals' immediate release from detention.
       </p>
       <p>
        I visited Cambodia last August and met with—I won't say with whom, to protect their identifies—a range of incredibly brave labour and civil rights and political activists. They deserve more support from the Australian government.
