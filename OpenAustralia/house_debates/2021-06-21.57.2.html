         [by video link] The member for Riverina is currently the

          Deputy Prime Minister of Australia
         </a>
         . As you're aware, the National Party held an election today and the new Leader of the Nationals is the member for New England. I congratulate him on his election by his party today and look forward to working closely with him, as I have indeed worked with the current Deputy Prime Minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to place on record my deep appreciation to the current Deputy Prime Minister.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_and_I" rel="nofollow">
          He and I
         </a>
         have enjoyed a close and strong bond, leading two great parties together as part of a strong coalition. I know that will be the case with the new Leader of the Nationals, the member for New England. I particularly want to commend the member for Riverina, the Deputy Prime Minister, for his great integrity, his tremendous dignity, for a work ethic that I think shames most in the chamber. To his wife, Catherine, we extend our great thanks for the wonderful relationship we've shared together, and Jenny does as well.

            behind him might be having an effect on the Leader of the Opposition, but I've heard the Prime Minister answer the question specifically. We can try and get the volume turned up, but I've heard every word he has been saying. What I will say, before I come back to the Prime Minister, is: if members are having difficulty hearing, that's good, because you can stop

             [by video link] Further to the great achievements of the Deputy Prime Minister, for his work not only on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
              Western Sydney
             </a>
             international airport, Inland Rail and the National Water Grid but also on the Building Better Regions Fund, I particularly want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his leadership in supporting the government and myself as Prime Minister dealing with the COVID crisis. The Deputy Prime Minister kept Australia moving. Whether it was the international freight, whether it was the national freight code agreed with state and territory transport ministers, keeping Australia moving during the COVID crisis has been essential to the wellbeing of Australians, particularly in rural and regional areas. So, for the work and leadership he's shown during that crisis, Australians will thank him for a very long time to come.
            </p>
            <p>
             The new Deputy Prime Minister will be sworn in tomorrow, and those arrangements are being made with His Excellency the Governor-General. I look forward to the relationship that I will renew with the member for New England in coming back into the cabinet and serving as Deputy Prime Minister, because we've got a lot to do. There's a lot of work to be done. There's a lot of support that we need to continue to provide to rural and regional Australians.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
              The Nationals
             </a>
             is a party that is grounded in rural and regional Australia, and works with the Liberals in rural and regional areas as well, to ensure that we understand the challenges faced by regions. In those regions, the heavy industries, the agricultural sector, the trade deals that they require, the infrastructure that supports their way of life—this is what our government champions. We understand the challenges of rural and regional Australia, and the coalition between the Liberals and the Nationals is what enables us, I think, to be such a strong government for supporting rural and regional Australians. I congratulate the member for New England on his election as Nationals leader, and my heartfelt thanks go to the Deputy Prime Minister for being such a tremendous bloke.
