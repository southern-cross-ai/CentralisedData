       <p>
        It is with deep sadness that I rise today to speak on the passing of Harry van Moorst. I rise to pay tribute to my friend and to a leader in my community. Our community lost a humble, fiercely intelligent giant, a campaigner for the environment and for social justice. Harry passed in the palliative care unit at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Mercy_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harry and partner Suzi Graham came to live in Werribee when Harry began to work as a lecturer in community development at the then newly opened Victoria University's Werribee campus. He was already an established campaigner for social justice, having led the Victorian Vietnam moratorium and been key in the community-led coalition against poverty and unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, though, he is best known for his work to protect the environment and our community with the Werribee Residents Against Toxic Dump, locally known as WRATD. This committee fought and defeated a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSR" rel="nofollow">
         CSR
        </a>
        proposal for a toxic waste facility that was supported by the Kennett Liberal government. On an historic win, members of the WRATD committee dissolved the entity and created the Western Region Environment Centre, with Harry as inaugural director. It's remit was about education and action, and Harry did both beautifully. Bluntly, whenever there was an issue of concern to locals, a call would go out to Harry to test the veracity of the situation. His knowledge of environmental and community issues and his capacity to organise and create inclusive grassroots movements and link people with like or supportive organisations were legendary. He was committed to building an inclusive, cohesive, fair society.
       </p>
       <p>
        His local contribution stretched across decades, from presenting to local history classes to recently supporting a committee formed to represent locals in a battle to find a more appropriate site for a state government youth detention centre. Harry was always willing to assist because he believed community meant working together. In our community, where that is our full-time job, building community in new developments, Harry was an absolute angel.
       </p>
       <p>
        He leaves behind a grieving family. To Suzi Graham, his partner; to his children, Tom, Monica, Kim and Mallory, who rallied during his final months to give support to him and Suzi; to the foster children who became part of their family over many yearsâ€”to all of them I give my deepest sympathy on behalf of our broader community. He was a modest man and he mentored a generation of activists. Harry, thank you for what you taught me and for what you taught our community.
