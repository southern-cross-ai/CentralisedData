        Across all corners of Northern Tasmania this past weekend, coaches, parents and players from netball, soccer and

        gathered on courts and muddy grounds to play their final games of the winter season. Anyone involved in club sport is acutely aware that the months of weekday training and weekend games do not happen without volunteers.

        Today, I want to recognise a special one: Scott Flynn. Scott—or Bruiser, as he is affectionately known—is renowned for his post-game catchcry to players, 'Jumpers in the bag, rubbish in the bin,' and has been the stalwart of the

         St Patrick's

        College football club for over three decades, including 31 years on the committee, 21 years as secretary and eight years as bar manager. Scott's dedication earned him life membership in 2002 and 'official club legend' in 2011. Every year, the Scott Flynn Medal is awarded to the best player at the president's lunch. Much to the joy of the St Patrick's football community, just last week Scott was announced as the winner of the AFL Community Football National Volunteer of the Year award, a just award for someone described by

        , as the face of the club. 'He adds to the character of the club. You couldn't imagine the football club without Scott Flynn,' Ian said. To top off what was already a big week, Scott's beloved team won the
