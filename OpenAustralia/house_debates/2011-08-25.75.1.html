         I thank the member for Page for her question. She has been very interested in how health reform is delivering for the whole country but particularly in her electorate, where over $50 million is being invested in emergency departments, in a cancer centre, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         superclinics, in a new assessment unit and in accommodation for cancer patients. So there is good news, which those constituents in the electorate of Page are seeing evidence of each and every day. We are very proud to be part of a government that is moving forward on all fronts in terms of health reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course a big step was taken yesterday in part of our health reforms where this House passed the world's first plain-packaging legislation for cigarettes. It was a big occasion and a very courageous step that this parliament and our nation is taking. I must mention, especially when tomorrow is Daffodil Day, that we have those from the Cancer Council here in the gallery today. I am sure they are pleased not only that so many of us are wearing their scarves and badges but that this step that is being taken will help to reduce the toll that cancer causes in our community, because so much of that cancer is still caused from tobacco related disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, although the Leader of the Opposition did not oppose the main legislation that was debated in the House, a very large number from his backbench spoke passionately against it including the member for Mitchell, who said that there was no point bothering about such things because life kills anyway, so why would you bother doing anything to reduce the harms caused by tobacco? What a disgrace.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was equalled only by the member for Dawson, who said that smoking was fun, so why would we pass this sort of legislation? He showed absolutely no understanding as to why we are trying to reduce the harms of tobacco. Coming into this parliament and making these sorts of ridiculous comments is not a good way to set an example for our community.

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that the minister has made a false statement to parliament. I did not say smoking was fun. I would ask herâ€”

           The member for Dawson will resume his seat. Order! The member for Dawson should know by now, but if not somebody will inform him, that there are other ways that he can address his grievance.

           <p>
            Of course, in relation to many health reform measures we have seen the Liberal Party be entirely inconsistent. We have had the Leader of the Opposition saying, on no less than six occasions, that he supports activity based funding and we have had the shadow minister telling the
            <i>
             Financial Review
            </i>
            and others that they will vote against that in the parliament. We have the Leader of the Opposition setting up a temporary safety and quality commission. He did not make it permanent; when we made it permanent they voted against it. He promised he was going to build e-health records in five years. He did not deliver those. We are now delivering those and they are now opposed to them. He said he supported more transparency in our hospitals; he did not make that happen. We are making that happen and they now oppose it. The Leader of the Opposition spent his time as health minister saying he could have done something, he should have done something, he would have done something, but he did not. We are doing it and it is time they got on board and supported us.
