        This week has been a proud time for our nation, but it has also been a time for sombre reflection, where we celebrate the brave and tenacious fight of our first Nation people, and we reflect on the fact that they were not counted as citizens in this great nation until after the 1967 referendum. Today we had the honour and privilege of having some of our first nation people and their families here, who were involved in the fight for the 1967 referendum. They were here to celebrate the 50th anniversary. We also celebrate and pay tribute to the 25th anniversary of the Mabo High Court decision. On Tuesday morning 20 years ago the Prime Minister received the

        I am proud to stand and say that I value the fact that I share this wonderful land with the oldest living culture. I am in awe of the courage, sheer determination, passion and resilience of our first nation people. Their battles have been long, tough and at times very painful, but they have not given up, and our nation is all the better for that. However, the fight is not yet over. We still have a long way to go, and every first nation citizen deserves no less than a commitment to live a fulfilling life.
