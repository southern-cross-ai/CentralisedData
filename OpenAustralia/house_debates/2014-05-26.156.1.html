       <p>
        I wish to express my condolences to the family and friends of Paul Rainsford. Paul passed away suddenly in April, aged 43. He was a resident of the Wallerawang area all his life and, while I did not personally get to meet Paul, I received many calls to my office following Paul's passing commending him and his achievements in the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul attended the Wallerawang public and Lithgow high schools during his educative years. He commenced his boilermaking trade in 1997 at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallerawang_Power_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Wallerawang Power Station
        </a>
        . He went on to work in the local power industry for all of his career, spending considerable time at both the Mount Piper and Wallerawang power stations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am told that Paul was an extremely talented sportsman, playing junior and senior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League
        </a>
        , baseball and lawn bowls. He played locally and also represented the Wallerawang area in group Rugby League, group baseball and numerous lawn bowls pennant matches.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also contributed significantly to his local community through coaching, umpiring and club committee support. As such, Paul was a highly regarded and highly respected member of the Wallerawang community. His willingness to give and his ability to bring out the best in people through mentoring and advice will be sadly missed. Paul was a dedicated family man and is survived by his wife, Kathy; his son, Jack; and his daughter, Erin. Arrangements are currently underway by members of the community to hold a fundraising event to assist the family during this difficult time.
