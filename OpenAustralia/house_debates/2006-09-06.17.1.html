        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>

        The purpose of the

         bill
        </a>
        is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, which provides funding to states and territories for government schools and funding for non-government schools for the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. The Australian government will provide a record estimated $33 billion in funding for Australian schools over the four years, 2005-08. This is the largest ever commitment by an Australian government to schooling in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The act provides for a significant investment by the Australian government in school infrastructure for both state owned government schools and non-government schools. This will assist in improving educational outcomes for all Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the capital grants program an estimated $1.7 billion is being provided over 2005-08 to assist with the building, maintenance and updating of schools throughout Australia. An estimated $1.2 billion will be provided for state and territory government schools over 2005-08, whilst an estimated $489 million will be provided for Catholic and independent schools for the same period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill appropriates capital grants funding for the years 2009 to 2011, to include capital grant funding allocations in the act for government and non-government schools for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Funding amounts for program years beyond 2008 are required because capital grants are approved up to three years in advance of the current calendar year. In 2006 a capital project may be approved involving funding for program years through to 2009. Funding amounts in the bill are in initial 2005 prices, the price basis of the act. They do not take into account the generous supplementation provided annually by the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill ensures that approval of Australian government capital funding assistance for state and territory government and non-government schools can continue, providing stability in Australian government capital funding to state education departments and non-government school block grant authorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill maintains the Australian government’s commitment to a strong school sector by assisting state and territory government and non-government schools with important building projects which will support improved educational outcomes for all Australian students.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
