        I rise to speak today about a remarkable young man, Neil William Anderson, a brilliant scientific mind and an inventor, with a loving network of family and friends. Born in 1995, Neil grew up in a loving family home, with his sister, Elise, and his devoted parents, Keith and Joan Anderson—and I acknowledge Neil's parents presence in the gallery today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neil loved the outdoors; he enjoyed overnight hikes with his dad, where they would laugh off the challenges of roughing it. Attending St Peter's Catholic College on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Central Coast
        </a>
        , Neil excelled in science and received the school's citizenship award in 2008, recognising his contribution to college life in an honest, courteous, and inclusive manner. While at school he undertook part-time jobs as an electronics technician and a database developer.
       </p>
       <p>
        After completing his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 2013, Neil undertook a

        with a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_University" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie University
        </a>
        , majoring in electronic engineering and physical chemistry. Recognised for his talent and promise, Neil was awarded the Macquarie University CBMS Research Scholarship in 2015. During his time at university, Neil also worked as an associate researcher into semiconductors and as a lab demonstrator, teaching year 11 and 12 students and conducting experiments on water quality. In 2020, Neil graduated with honours, writing about the optimisation of materials and device architecture for solution processed electronics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond his studies, Neil was a regular donor to and supporter of the veterans' charity
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_On" rel="nofollow">
         Soldier On
        </a>
        . In March 2020, he completed the March On Challenge by walking a total of 100 kilometres in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        to raise money for the prevention of veteran suicide. With his sights set on pursuing a career in nuclear science, Neil completed an internship at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Lucas Heights
        </a>
        nuclear reactor, where he tested newly developed semiconductor materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still a young man, Neil proved himself as a pioneer and entrepreneur. After his time at Lucas Heights, he founded and directed his own company, SPINXFiltration, where he developed a centrifugal oil-cleaning system for small diesel engines. His idea was to extend the life of diesel engines to save customers' money. Neil had ambitious plans to develop materials for the energy industry and for defence industries relating to nuclear submarines. His inspiration, in his own words, was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … to advance the understanding of novel semiconducting materials with functionality relevant to modern technologies, particularly those with defence and sustainable energy applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Determined to make his dream a reality, Neil apply to Oxford university to do his doctorate and was accepted. Unfortunately, the expense of attending Oxford made it unattainable, but opportunities beckoned elsewhere. Neil was offered a generous scholarship to work with a world-renowned research team at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. This was a fantastic opportunity for Neil to pursue his dreams, and he relocated to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        on 1 August 2021. Neil integrated seamlessly into his new research team and forged friendships in his new home. On the evening of 29 October 2021, Neil and one of his classmates headed out to dinner, thinking it would be a fun night like any other, but it ended in tragedy. Crossing the road on their way home, Neil and his friend were struck down by a speeding sports car running a red light. Neil's friend ultimately survived, with Neil fighting for his life in an Atlanta hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        His parents travelled to the other side of the world to be by his bedside, but Neil died on 7 November 2021. It's impossible to imagine the heartbreak and grief of Joanne and Keith; Neil's sister, Elise; and Neil's 85-year-old grandmother, Janice Flynn. The family's grief was compounded by the fact that the driver received a manifestly inadequate sentence for the innocent life his negligent driving claimed. The driver who took Neil's life was charged only with misdemeanours. He was released on bond with a fine of only$1,000 and 30 days community service.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member of the Australian parliament, I can't interfere with the legal processes of another country—although today I've written to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador" rel="nofollow">
         United States Ambassador
        </a>
        to Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Kennedy
        </a>
        , asking her to take up this case with the Georgia state authorities and have it reviewed. For someone to take the life of such a promising young man and yet be charged not with manslaughter but with a misdemeanour is a travesty of justice. Neil's loved ones have not only lost a son, a grandson, a brother and a friend but Australia has been robbed of one of its most promising minds—a budding scientist with the potential to shape the course of nuclear research in Australia and abroad at a time in our history when we need our best and brightest minds focused on this task.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say to Neil's family: Neil's life mattered, and today in this House we've recorded some of his contributions and his achievements on the national record. I stand with Neil's family and friends in their pain, loss and grief. Today, as a parliament, we pause to remember the priceless gift that was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Anderson
        </a>
        , whose life was filled with affection, fun and laughter. We remember his appetite for adventure, his brilliant mind and his resolve to serve our country in nuclear science. May Neil William Anderson's memory be a blessing to all those who knew him.
