        I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovation occurring in my electorate as a direct result of the government's Clean Energy Future policies. Through the support of these initiatives and programs, individuals and businesses across the Fremantle electorate have seized on the chance to explore and develop the kinds of technologies that will put Australia on the path towards a low-carbon energy-efficient economy. In Jandakot, the family owned garden products company Richgro is investing in a $3 million anaerobic waste-to-energy plant that will provide 100 per cent of the site's electricity needs with the support of a $1 million grant through the Clean Technology Investment Program. Any surfeit electricity will be directed to the grid and the digestate from the anaerobic process will be incorporated in Richgro's garden products, making this a zero waste system.

        Meanwhile, in his backyard workshop,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         South Fremantle
        </a>
        inventor Graeme Attey is turning his energy and water efficient HIVAP evaporative air conditioner from a prototype to a commercial reality with a grant of $138,000 from Commercialisation Australia. The HIVAP unit, which is small enough to fit in any standard loft space, will be the only system capable of operating using seawater or greywater, thereby potentially saving 30,000 litres of potable water per household per year. It is incredibly encouraging to think of all the savings, environmental and economic, that will be made when this supersedes the energy thirsty units that now burden the electricity grid and our household budgets.

        With more than $1.54 million through the National Solar Schools Program, there are 35 schools across my electorate that have reduced energy consumption and increased energy efficiency by installing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PV" rel="nofollow">
         PV
        </a>
        solar systems, solar hot water units, rainwater tanks, other renewable energy systems and energy efficiency measures. Most recently, Southwell Primary School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Hamilton Hill
        </a>
        received a $50,000 grant to install a 40-panel PV solar system atop its undercover area. At almost 10 kilowatts, this system is expected to supply more than half of the school's entire energy needs. A web based metering system will allow Southwell students to see the amount of renewable energy generated on their rooftop and to monitor energy consumption. Today's students' understanding of energy needs, use, efficiency and innovation will be the platform for tomorrow's innovations and improved systems of demand management.

        I have spoken before on a number of occasions about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         North Fremantle
        </a>
        based Carnegie Wave Energy and their efforts to expand the application of their technology with the support of a $10 million grant through the Emerging Renewables Program. The Fremantle electorate has always been a place that seeks out, trials, refines and adopts innovation. It has an established reputation as a leader in urban sustainability. The examples that I have given today show that the Fremantle community is continuing to break new ground in pursuit of positive change and that the participants are as varied as a back-shed inventor, a new publicly listed company, a family owned business that has been run over three generations and dozens of local schools. Australia's clean energy future must belong to all of us and it will require contributions from right across our society. The good news is that these contributions are being made and are being supported by government policy.
