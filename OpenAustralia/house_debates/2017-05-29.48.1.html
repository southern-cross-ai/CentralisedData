       <p>
        Friday was an historic day. From Uluru, a powerful statement was made by Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        peoples: that in 1967 they were counted and in 2017 they were seeking to be heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the very time that the Uluru Statement from the Heart was delivered, in my electorate of Melbourne—on Wurundjeri land—members of the stolen generations gathered to mark
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sorry_Day" rel="nofollow">
         National Sorry Day
        </a>
        with families, friends, communities and supporters. On the 20th anniversary of the
        <i>
         Bringing them home
        </i>
        report, people spoke of the loss of those who were taken away. Flowers were laid and a smoking ceremony was held.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Melbourne commemoration was organised by Connecting Home and Link Up Victoria. I would like to acknowledge these organisations for their important work in supporting members of the stolen generations, and in creating awareness in the community about the ongoing impacts of child removal policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speakers at the commemoration made the clear call: do not let this happen again. Do not let more children be taken away. And yet, 20 years on, governments have failed to act on too many recommendations, and many people are warning of a new stolen generation. Let's be very clear: this is unfinished business to take care of. It is time for truth telling about our history and our present. It is time for reparations for the stolen generations. It is time for a meaningful and substantive change to our institutions and it is time to acknowledge that the sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples has never been ceded. It is time for a treaty and it is time for those of us in this place to listen and to take action.
