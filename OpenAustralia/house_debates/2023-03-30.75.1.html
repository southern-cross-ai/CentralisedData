         Climate Change

        and Energy. How will passage of the Albanese government's safeguard reforms progress action on climate change and deliver a strong economy? Are there any obstacles to these reforms?

         I recognise the expertise and experience of the member for Swan in climate change and resources, and I appreciate her counsel as well as her question. I'm very pleased to inform the member for Swan and the House that just before question time the government's safeguard legislation passed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Senate
         </a>
         , 32 votes to 26.
        </p>
        <p>
         Government members: Hear, hear!
        </p>
        <p>
         What the parliament has done today is safeguard our climate, safeguard our economy and safeguard our future. What the parliament has done today is draw to an end 10 years of dysfunction and 10 years of delay. What the parliament has done today is start the Australian industrial economy on the road to decarbonisation. We can now get on with the job of reducing our emissions by 43 per cent. We can now get on with the job of creating jobs of the future in a decarbonised economy. That's what this parliament has done today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've met, even today, with chief executives of Australian industry who've told me that now they have the certainty to make investments which will reduce carbon and create jobs. Now they have the certainty, they've told me and the government, and they are keen to get on with it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank the Senate. I want to thank the Greens senators. I want to thank Senator Lambie, Senator Tyrrell, Senator Thorpe and Senator Pocock. A vote of 32 to 26 and a vote in the House of 87 to 55 means that this parliament reflects the will of the Australian people to take action on climate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked if there were any obstacles. Well, there were a few. There is a rump of irrelevance, but that rump of irrelevance has been overcome. The numbers in the House and the Senate reflect a broad coalition. The government's policy has been supported by the Business Council of Australia and the Climate Council, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Conservation Foundation
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industry_Group" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Industry Group
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
         </a>
         and groups right across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government knows how to build coalitions. The coalition has forgotten. There's a broad coalition in favour of support and a little coalition fighting on against action on climate change. For too long in this country, the government of the day weaponised climate policy to divide Australians, pitting Australians in the regions against Australians in the cities. This government uses climate to unite Australians in our great national endeavour to reduce emissions and create the jobs of the future in the regions right across Australiaâ€”the great regions that power Australia. Those regions will be at the centre of our renewable economy. This government gets on with the job and gets over 10 years of denial and delay.
