         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

          The Government
         </a>
         draws on a range of reliable, peer reviewed research in developing climate change policies such as the Clean Energy Future Plan. Reliable information sources include the Intergovernmental Panel on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change

         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         ), the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and other peer reviewed literature.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The role of the IPCC is to advise policy makers about the current state of knowledge and provide reliable information pertaining to climate change. The IPCC does not conduct scientific research itself, but instead reviews the thousands of scientific papers on climate change published in the peer reviewed literature every year. The state of knowledge on climate change is summarised in the IPCC's assessment reports, published approximately every six to seven years. The reports are subject to an intense peer review process involving hundreds of scientific experts and government reviewers. This unprecedented level of peer and government review makes this compendium of climate change science one of the most scrutinised documents in the history of science.

        <p class="italic">
         The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 is a key information source for the Government in developing climate change policies. Twenty-four Australian authors contributed to all three

         The Government also draws on the body of peer reviewed work that has been completed since the Fourth Assessment Report was published.
