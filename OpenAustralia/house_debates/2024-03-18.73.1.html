       <p>
        I rise today to speak about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Seniors Festival, which runs from 11 to 24 March. This is a time when we celebrate the invaluable contributions of our older citizens to our local communities. I want to highlight two remarkable individuals from my electorate of Hume: Jean Lloyd and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Strong" rel="nofollow">
         Ray Strong
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Jean Lloyd was named Goulburn Mulwaree's Senior of the Year just last week. She has spent decades volunteering with organisations like Goulburn Legacy, Meals on Wheels and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        . What drives Jean is simple: it's people; it's the local community. She finds fulfilment in improving someone's day every day; making a life a little bit easier; listening to their fascinating stories; leading by example; and rallying volunteers to join her in initiatives like the Goulburn Legacy Lodge committee, where they provide essential support to seniors in their community. I would like to congratulate the Goulburn Legacy Lodge committee as well, because they were recognised as senior group of the year at last week's celebration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge finalist Ray Strong, who was recognised for his tireless work raising money for Goulburn's Lions Club. He was also recognised for his assistance with the Voice of Youth competition and help during Legacy Week as a reserve member. Those of us who represent regional towns and rural areas know how, in every town, a few people make a huge difference. They are left doing an enormous amount of work, and Jean and Ray are wonderful examples of just that.
