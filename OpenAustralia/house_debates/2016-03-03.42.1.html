       <p>
        Recently I had the pleasure of attending Bexley North Public School's student-led parliament in my electorate of Barton. I was fortunate enough to open the student mock parliament, along with discussing some of my insights into being the federal member for Barton and shedding light on parliamentary proceedings to the students and teachers. Opportunities like this allow students to gain a sense of leadership and perspective on parliamentary processes from an early age, conveying the quality of education we have in our schools today. The power of education has become an entrenched value in our society, empowering each individual and instilling a sense of confidence like no other.
       </p>
       <p>
        We, as parliamentarians, have the responsibility of setting an example for future generations to come. I made sure to discuss the importance of education and exploring new areas that they may not be familiar with. I also encouraged the students to always give something a try, as mistakes are not failures but simply learning experiences. It was great to see the interaction and initiative taken in the student-led parliament, with a couple of ministers being represented—an environment minister and a minister for innovation and science—demonstrating an accurate portrayal of parliament. This provided a clearer understanding of what each portfolio contains and the responsibilities that are carried out by each minister. I congratulate both the students and teachers involved in the proceedings.
