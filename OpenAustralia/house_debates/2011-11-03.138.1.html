       <p>
        Last week I was privileged to attend the official opening of Fusion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney

        . I have had a long association with Fusion, officially opening their previous Western Sydney centre over 10 years ago when I was the Mayor of Penrith. Over the years I have watched Fusion grow from strength to strength, and the opening of this new centre marks a significant milestone for the people of Western Sydney. The centre was officially opened by 2011 Australian of the Year, Simon McKeon, who generously turned down an invitation to join the queen at a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOGM" rel="nofollow">

        event in Perth to accept my invitation to open the centre in St Mary's.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fusion play an invaluable role in our local community, particularly through their work with youth, the elderly and the disabled. They provide training, accommodation and support, but most of all they offer hope to those in need. Fusion Western Sydney's new centre stands on the old St Mary's bowling club site in the heart of the St Mary's CBD. Fusion have a lease over the site, which has been vacant for a number of years and is owned by the St Mary's Band Club. I thank the board and management at the band club for the role they have played in supporting the centre's relocation. I wish to acknowledge and thank the vast number of people who worked tirelessly to deliver this project. Firstly I acknowledge Dave Hammond, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Fusion Western Sydney, and his wife, Sally, the manager of Fusion community development, who have both dedicated much of their lives to serving the most vulnerable. For Dave and Sally the centre marks a significant step forward in delivering on their vision for increasing Fusion's capacity to build a better community and improve the lives of thousands of people in Western Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fusion Western Sydney has an army of volunteers and staff members who gave up countless hours of their days, nights and weekends to help build this project. I would particularly like to recognise Steve McNee, Ron Rademaker, Marg Cooke, Bruce Peel, Judy Tweeddale, Leizsha Clissold, Josh Shelley, Jeff Estanislao,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Peter Tasic. Each time I visited the centre during the construction process, including during the working bees, I was blown away by the progress that had been made, but more inspired by the passion and dedication of the Fusion team.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project would not have been possible without the generous contributions of many businesses and individuals who offered their services and products at discounted rates or without charge. In a loaves-and-fishes story, the Fusion team turned $140,000 into a $1.2 million centre thanks to the generous contributions of cash, materials and services. I congratulate everyone who was involved in the relocation and development of the new Fusion Western Sydney centre. These brilliant facilities are the product of years of hard work and dedication. While I am impressed by these new facilities, it is the passion and dedication of those operating within the centre that has truly inspired me.
