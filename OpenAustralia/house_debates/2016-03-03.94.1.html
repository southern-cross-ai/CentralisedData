        My question is to the Minister for Resources, Energy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        . Will the minister please update the House on the government's commitment to strengthen Australia's defence presence in northern Australia? How will the government's defence white paper and defence industry policy statement provide jobs, opportunities and security for the people of northern Australia, including in my electorate of Herbert and city of Townsville?

         I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I acknowledge that his electorate is home to Australia's largest army base and he has been a staunch advocate for the ADF, both in Townsville and beyond.

         Last week, the Prime Minister, the defence minister, the Minister for Defence Materiel and the assistant defence minister released the defence white paper, which included an additional $30 billion worth of defence spending and a host of new initiatives, particularly focusing on innovation, including a new centre for defence industry capability. While all Australians were great beneficiaries of the new white paper, it was particularly so for northern Australia, because it is incredibly important, from a geostrategic sense, to Australia's defence outlook.

         The defence white paper is a historic document. It provides Australia with the strategy, the assets and the innovation to advance our interests in a complex world.

         is a big beneficiary of this, because the white paper underlines its geostrategic importance to our defence outlook.
