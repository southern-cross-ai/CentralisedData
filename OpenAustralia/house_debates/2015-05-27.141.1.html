       <p>
        Today, I take the opportunity to highlight several constituents who deserve recognition for their substantial contribution as volunteers. They are by no means the only individuals of note, but they represent a strong and ongoing tradition of volunteering across the communities in my electorate of Cowper. By noting their roles we say 'thank you', not only to these individuals, but to the more than six million volunteers who are making a difference to their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those six million volunteers is Brian Ferrie who is a tireless citizen of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        . His dedication as Maclean Show Society President ensures the marvellous annual attraction of the Maclean and Lower Clarence Show. Brian has also been actively involved in the Clarence River Jockey Club and in the Maclean
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        as well as Apex and Lions. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with Brian and presenting him with a certificate of appreciation when he and his wife, Lou, joined me for an afternoon tea in Coffs Harbour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another distinguished volunteer is Lee-Ann Lloyd who recently returned to Australia after evacuation from Nepal. Lee-Ann is well known in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         City of Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        for her contributions to the Disabled Surfers Association and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Lee-Ann was also recognised on

        as

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Another of Australia's six million volunteers deserving of recognition is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Christian" rel="nofollow">
         Diana Christian
        </a>
        of Bellingen. In addition to serving as Rotary Club president in her local community, she is regional youth director and has served as the district assistant governor for three years. She is involved with strategic planning, with Open Arms Care—a community service working with children—the aged and people living with disabilities across the townships of Raleigh, Bellingen and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambucca_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Nambucca Heads
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge the contribution of Bruce Cain, who has been helping the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempsey_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kempsey Shire Council
        </a>
        over many years in what would be an otherwise thankless task. He has been converting handwritten ledgers of cemetery records into an online database and then mapping each of the shire's 13 cemeteries. Bruce, who is President of the Kempsey Family History Group, has scanned hundreds of obituaries from old newspapers, helping many people understand their past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blue Manning is another deserving of recognition for his volunteering efforts. He is President of the Frank Partridge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        Military Museum in Bowraville, which, through his leadership, has managed to acquire one of the best collections of military memorabilia in Australia. As a result, visitors to the museum have tripled, turning it into one of the Nambucca Valley's great tourist attractions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these exceptional individuals is usually the first to raise a hand but the last to receive public accolade. In this they typify the true Australian volunteer spirit and I commend them and Australians like them in recognition of National Volunteer Week.
