        Deputy Speaker, as you know, I have been very vocal in my outrage and disappointment over the cuts made in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        latest funding round. As we know, this year's budget locks in all the unfairness of last year's budget when it comes to cuts to community organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just days before Christmas last year, community groups right around the country learned their federal funding was being cut. After a huge outcry across Australia, the government announced 'bridging funding' to a number of these organisations. However, that bridging funding did not include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Chinese Aged Care Information and Referral Service, which has had its funding cut and has not been thrown a lifeline. This ACT Chinese-Australian service had been receiving funding from the Australian government to run a broad range of bilingual services to Canberra's aged Chinese population since 2007. It provides a valuable service to the elderly Chinese community here in Canberra in a broad range of areas. I have met with the group, and they are extremely disappointed, as are their clients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just do not understand how this government expects this country to tackle issues like ageing, particularly in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
         CALD
        </a>
        community; poverty; homelessness; family violence; and protecting our environment, heritage, and culture without strong communities and strong community organisations. This government should reverse its unfair and short-sighted cuts to these important community services.
