        Over the weekend, Insignia Hair and Day Spa hosted Wigs for Kids, a hair-raising event to promote the donation of ponytails in support of people living with the autoimmune disease alopecia, which affects around two per cent of Australians, both male and female. In all, 56 ponytails were donated after free haircuts were given by the Insignia staff, who donated their Sunday to this event. These ponytails will now be turned into wigs.
       </p>

        It is hard to imagine what it would be like to live with alopecia if you were a 14-year-old girl, or even a nine-year-old girl, facing permanent or total hair loss. That is the story of two young women in Lindsay. Kelsie was diagnosed with alopecia at age nine and lost every hair on her head. Her supportive parents provided a wig, and Kelsie lived under her new hair until about two years ago, when she was brave enough to go out in public without her wig. It was a momentous occasion for a teenager and something that her complete loss of hair had previously prevented her from doing. Kelsie hasn't let her hair loss stand in her way or stop her from pursuing her dreams. She has danced her way through life and is now in the Pantherette cheer squad. Kelsie was on hand to provide some great advice to newly-diagnosed 14-year-old Chloe. The pair talked about the condition, and Kelsie was able to offer support to Chloe as she starts her journey.

        None of this would have been possible without the amazing staff at Insignia, who volunteered their time for the event, led by Amanda Wiley, the owner. A big thanks to Melissa Byrne, Olivia Mangold, Courtney Guillaume, Mitch Vanderpump, Alix Smithard, Alicia Carr, Louise Bushby, Emma Laycock, Phoebe Connolly, Kiara Daly, Sue Mitchell, Marianne Arther and Prescilla Garofali. Much thanks to Jeremy, the blond butler, for the catering;
