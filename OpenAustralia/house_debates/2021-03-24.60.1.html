        My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister defended his use of an alleged confidential complaint about workplace misconduct inside a media organisation to dismiss questions. Given his midnight apology, which came only after the front pages of today's newspapers were published, will the Prime Minister now commit to give straight answers to simple questions about his handling of a reported sexual assault just metres from his office?

         The Leader of the Opposition has made reference to the apology that I've already provided, late last night as I arrived in Richmond. It was not done in the way that was characterised by the Leader of the Opposition. I had not seen those things that the Leader of the Opposition asserts that I had. I had reflected very strongly, over the course of that evening, on the matters that were raised in that press conference yesterday. And I have apologised unreservedly for what I did in bringing that matter into that press conference and raising something I should never have raised, and that was done not respecting those individuals who are at the centre of that particular issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've given that apology. I've given that apology honestly and openly, and I will continue, where there are situations of that nature where I believe that is necessary, to do that, and I will do it honestly. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to take these matters and pursue them for some partisan advantage, that's up to him. I'm going to keep focusing on the issues that we have to focus on to make this country safer for women.
