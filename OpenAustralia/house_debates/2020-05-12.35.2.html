        My question is to the Prime Minister. On 15 April, the Prime Minister said that at least 40 per cent of the Australian population would need to download the COVIDSafe app for it to work. Can the Prime Minister update the House on what proportion of the population have downloaded the app and what steps the government has taken to encourage further take-up?

         That reference was made after some discussions we had had with the Singaporean government about the app that had run in Singapore. We had taken, as their gift, the code that had been used for the TraceTogether app, as the shadow minister, I'm sure, is aware. While we have no real target, what is important is that as many people download the COVIDSafe app as is possible and I thank all members of this place for their cooperation in sending a common message out to Australians that this is one of the key protections that need to be in place, as we go back into our economy and into our society. As restrictions are eased, this is one of the key protections that are in place. Just over 5.6 million people have now downloaded that app. There is a total population of those who could download the app of around 16 million. I will allow the member to do the maths, but it is around one-third of that population that so far has downloaded that app. Recently, I was part of a regular group that is now gathering of what are called 'first movers' around various countries who have had some success in our battle against the virus, and there has been great interest in Australia's success to date with this app. We are only about two weeks down with this app. In other countries, they have been in place—for months in Singapore's case—and still have not reached the levels that we have in Australia.
        </p>

         So we remain confident, as we continue to work together and encourage Australians to download the COVIDSafe app, that we will continue to see those numbers rise and that we will continue to ensure that there are protections in place for Australians as they move around. Australians would have seen the significant investment we have made in those communications plans. People have seen that on their television screens, newspapers and social media. It has been endorsed by important groups, particularly nurses—and we recognise

         today—who stood with the minister and the

         president, giving it that strong endorsement.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tech community has also given it very strong praise when it comes to the safety that's around this app. This is important, because we want this app to work as an invitation to Australians to participate in ensuring that these protections are in place. Particularly now that restrictions are easing, we would further encourage Australians to do this. Many Australians would have been at home and the only people they may have seen were their household family members and the pets. Now, as they go back out into the community, they will come across more people. To protect those people and themselves and their family, I would continue to encourage Australians to download the COVIDSafe app today.

         Labor joins the Prime Minister in calling upon Australians to download the app.
