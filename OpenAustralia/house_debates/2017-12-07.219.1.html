       <p>
        On 11 November 2018 we will remember 100 years since the armistice, which brought an end to the hostilities and senseless deaths of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . It will be commemorated in my electorate of Blair among the many community groups, schools and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        branches. These groups and others are eligible for the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. It is a one-off grant to groups who will deliver projects and undertake activities in commemoration of the centenary of armistice. The successful recipients of the grants will demonstrate a commitment to honouring Australia's wartime history through public ceremonies, the restoration of public honour rolls and plaques as well as community events and educational programs with a focus on military heritage and involvement.

        base is the heart of the Defence community in my electorate, the local RSLs are the backbone. One of the RSLs honouring the centenary of armistice in November next year will be Toogoolawah sub-branch, which was recently awarded just over $40,000 under the Veterans and Community Grants program. This funding will allow this important veterans organisation to upgrade its kitchen facilities and continue to offer the services it does to returned service men and women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Region" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The group's president, Doug Cook, is one of the many hardworking community volunteers in Blair who commit their lives and time to supporting veterans and their families. Ex-service personnel face difficulties returning to civilian life, whether it's because of mental and physical health issues, the lack of job opportunities or otherwise. It's important to help them as a community—to get behind them to make sure they know they're valuable members of our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just yesterday, I spoke in this chamber about the Blair Disability Links expo I hosted last Friday. I want to thank the many service providers who came. In particular, I want to mention the Ipswich and District Veterans' Support Group. This community organisation is made up of 10 ex-service groups across Ipswich and the Somerset region who provide pensions and advocacy services to the local veteran community.

        I was pleased earlier in the week to notify
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robinson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the vice-president of the Kilcoy RSL sub-branch, to congratulate the sub-branch on their success in obtaining funding for a display of memorabilia honouring Australia's light horsemen, as many of those men came from the Somerset region—the boys from the Brisbane valley. They are honoured with photographs on the walls of the Toogoolawah sub-branch's hall but they will also be honoured at the Kilcoy sub-branch's hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've appointed a local armistice centenary grants committee. I want to thank the chair, Vivienne Stanbury, and the deputy chair,

        , Heather Danier and John Robinson, representing the West Moreton RSL region, the nashos—the national servicemen—Ipswich RSL, Legacy and Kilcoy RSL respectively. I encourage all eligible not-for-profit organisations, schools and RSLs to contact my office if they want to make an application.
