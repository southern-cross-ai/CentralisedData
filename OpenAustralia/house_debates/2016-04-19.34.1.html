        I rise today to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Rocher" rel="nofollow">
         Allan Rocher
        </a>
        , a senator for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and then member for Curtin from 1978 until 1998. He was the first friend that I made in this parliament. He was a friend to many from those days in this place. I especially remember two pieces of wisdom from Allan. First, his advice that it would take at least five years to become a competent parliamentarian, and with hindsight I think that was an underestimate. Second, his observation of a colleague who often told lies when it was not strictly necessary to tell lies, and that was a shrewd encapsulation of some of the conflicts which members of parliament face.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three other things about Allan Rocher. First, you could not have a more loyal friend, as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Winston_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Winston Howard
        </a>
        found out. Second, you could not meet a more genial man, as those who dropped by his nightly office drinks would well remember. Third, he hated factions because he thought that people and issues should be judged on their merits and not on the numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allan Rocher was never ambitious for himself. He was always ambitious for our party and for our country. He was an adornment to this parliament and that is why we should cherish his memory and remember him on this day.
