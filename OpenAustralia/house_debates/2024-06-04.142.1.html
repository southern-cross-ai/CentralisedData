        I rise to acknowledge a very special veteran in my electorate, Bill Hosking. Bill is a Darwin Defender and a World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        veteran, and he turned 100 this year on 26 April. Bill's birthday is a special birthday not just because he turned 100 but for how it came to be on the 26th. He tells the story that he was born at midnight and his family had the choice of the 25th, Anzac Day, or the 26th, a date which was his father's birthday—and they went for his father's birthday.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, on the eve of his 100th birthday, Bill had pride of place leading the Kangaroo Flat
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Anzac Day march in honour of his service. It was a special day for Bill, as he is one of our last remaining

        </a>
        veterans in Bendigo. He became involved in the Royal Australian Air Force Air Training Corps as a 17-year-old. His eyesight made him unsuitable for aircrew, so Bill spent his time in the service as part of the ground crew, salvaging and repairing aircraft. That is how he became stationed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        during World War II, and he was there during the attacks on Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following his time in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        , Bill gave his years of service to veterans. He helped establish the Central Victorian Veterans Support Centre and for many years volunteered there, helping local veterans to connect with support and assistance. He has his own views on veteran support services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill is an active member of the Kangaroo Flat RSL and has been since his days in service. Importantly, he is a local treasure and well loved by all who know him. He always has a great story to share and a yarn, and a smile to greet anybody who comes through the door. Happy birthday, Bill, and I look forward to celebrating your 101st birthday.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also rise to acknowledge the passing of Aunty Fay Carter, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dja_Dja_Wurrung" rel="nofollow">
         Dja Dja Wurrung
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorta_Yorta" rel="nofollow">
         Yorta Yorta
        </a>
        woman. Aunty Fay was a leader in many fields for her people, including the landmark
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Native Title Act
        </a>
        —the deal that formally recognised the Dja Dja Wurrung clan as the traditional owners in central Victoria. Aunty Fay was a remarkable woman that had a beautiful spirit that shone every time she smiled and spoke. Her story is like many of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         First Nation
        </a>
        leaders'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aunty Fay was born in 1935 on the verandah of the Echuca hospital because her mother, Iris, was not allowed inside. She shared this story often to ensure that the true history of our state and our health system was never forgotten and that the enduring impact on the present was also never forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        A statement made by her people, Djaara, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Aunty Fay always strived for the best outcomes for Aboriginal People, whether she was volunteering to progress self-determination … working for government, or for the community-run organisations she served.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She was a guiding light for the many family members Aunty Fay had inspired to dedicate their lives to self-determination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst Aunty Fay faced much discrimination throughout her life, she never let it beat her. She is known for saying the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When you look at the policies they've put in place over the years to try to make us go away, I think it must have really annoyed and amazed them that we're still here.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was her spirit. That is what I remember of Aunty Fay.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statement by Djaara said Aunty Fay was happiest with her family. This is also what the statement says, which I find quite fitting and beautiful:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        May she go in peace to the dreaming and be received by her Ancestors with the love she generously shared with her family and our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        My deepest condolences to her family and her community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to Aunty Fay: thank you on behalf of all of us in Bendigo and central Victoria. Thank you for sharing your culture with our children and for the way you've enriched their lives for many generations. Thank you, Aunty Fay. Vale, Aunty Fay.
