        . We were able to make that announcement four months ahead of schedule, which is proof the coalition is committed to delivering the infrastructure WA needs. The Grand Gateway is the first impression for visitors to WAâ€”and it makes a great impression, a fantastic impression. I am here today to provide an update of the project which is making road users very happy in my sunny state, but first let me give you a brief background.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gateway WA project is being delivered by using an alliance contract, where five industry leaders are working on partnership to deliver this major project. While some of the preliminary work packages began in early 2013, the major construction commenced in the third quarter of 2013. There are several segments that make up the road part of this project. These include
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkin_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        being widened to six lanes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leach_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        being upgraded to an expressway standard, several new grade separated interchanges and an upgraded intersection of Tonkin Highway and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Roe Highway
        </a>
        . If you have been to the Perth Airport lately, you will see the roads leading to it are beginning to look first-class. In September the Grand Gateway was lit up gold, blue and purple in celebration of both the

        teams making the finals.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week the alliance team has been busy doing painting, kerbing and landscaping around the airport area of the project. The primary focus of the project for this month has been at the Roe Highway/Berkshire Road intersection, which includes on- and off-ramps. This is a major project milestone because it means Roe Highway traffic will be relocated onto the new bridge which runs over Berkshire Road. Roe Highway traffic can now travel uninterrupted over Berkshire Road, reducing travel time. That particular part of the project is expected to be completed this weekend, so, from Monday morning onwards, through movements on Roe Highway will be free-flowing for road users.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it is not just road users who are benefitting from this great project. The project is delivering a number of upgrades and improved facilities that are designed to enhance the local area. The project has constructed approximately seven kilometres of new acoustic walls so that traffic noise is reduced for residents living near the major highways. The project managers brought in acoustic experts who determined the location and height of the walls. Those experts monitored noise using data loggers. They used these results to determine the locations and height of the walls. By positioning these walls between the road and residential properties, the sound from the road is forced to diffract around the edges of the walls, reducing the direct sound pressure. These walls can reduce road traffic noise by about five to 10 decibels, which would halve the perceived noise level, making life easier for residents living near these highways.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-one kilometres of new shared paths are also being installed as part of the project, which will provide improved facilities for cyclists and pedestrians. Once construction is completed, the new paths will provide improved access for walking and cycling along the new road alignment. Cycling infrastructure is an important part of this project, as Perth has experienced an increase in the number of cyclists using paths in recent years for commuting, exercise and leisure. It leads to fewer cars on the roads and improves traffic flow. As part of this project, seven cyclist-pedestrian underpasses and one bridge have been constructed to provide connectivity. There are several benefits of these paths: it is a safe way for the public to cycle or walk, separated from the busy road; there are multiple local connections where people can join the path; and the network provides opportunities for people to walk and cycle for health and recreational purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have saved the best news for last. The construction phase is now nearing completion and all the work is expected to be finished by the end of the first quarter of next year, ahead of the planned consolidation of the domestic and international Perth airport terminals. The Minister for Territories,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        and Major Projects is in the chamber. His dedication, along with that of the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, in having this project completed early, has enabled an extra interchange to go ahead. I look forward to welcoming the ministers to Western Australia for the opening of the magnificent Gateway WA project, which was built without a mining tax but through good operations and planning by the coalition government, which is seeking to build the infrastructure that Australia needs.
