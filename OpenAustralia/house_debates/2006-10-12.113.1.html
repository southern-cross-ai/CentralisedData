       <p>
        In the adjournment debate I wish to place on record my absolute praise and delight at the news that Norm Gibbs, Mr Waverley himself, has been nominated for and awarded the Premier’s seniors award for 2006. I know Norm personally and I can think of no more deserving person in our community to receive this award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm Gibbs has been an active community member all his life. Norm is the epitome of a volunteer. No task is too great or too small and all who ask will receive. I can speak with personal authority on this truly fantastic member of the community. Norm has been a vital asset to my annual Caroline Chisholm Awards as chair of the committee. I rely upon Norm greatly as a sounding board about the needs of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm began his community involvement as a Sunday school teacher and gym instructor at the Hughesdale Community Church, where his involvement lasted for 15 years. When Norm married Topsy—Topsy is also a fantastic community member and a great asset to Norm; much of his work could not have been achieved without her—and they moved to

        , he was a charter member of the Waverley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC" rel="nofollow">

        s. He became very involved with St Phillip’s

        in many groups but was instrumental in the formation of its youth group. In 1970 Norm became an honorary probation officer and is the longest serving honorary in this field. He still works as an honorary probation officer to this day and attends the Oakleigh police station once a week to provide
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP" rel="nofollow">
         JP
        </a>
        services. Norm worked tirelessly and visited many homes in his role as honorary probation officer and this role earned him the tag of ‘Mr Waverley’, the man who would be able to help. He was often called out at many hours of the night and it was never too great or too small a task; Norm would always attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next for Norm was the establishment of the Zodiac Dance and Zodiac Youth Group. He and Topsy were heavily involved in the Life Be In It campaign. Norm secured a bus for youth activities through local fundraising. Zodiac turned its attention to fundraising for relief after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy" rel="nofollow">

        and Norm spent three weeks in Darwin. As a trained plumber, he was a vital asset in part of the rebuilding process up there.
       </p>
       <p>
        This experience led Norm to think of a career change and when he returned from Darwin he applied and became a welfare officer with the Waverley City Council. He spent many years in that vital role. Norm first got involved with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Waverley in 1976 and continues that association to this day. Norm exemplifies the rotary motto of ‘service above self’. Norm became a Paul Harris Fellow in 1998 and named a Companion of the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund for his unceasing work for this organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zodo the clown was born in 1978 and he continues to this day. Norm, as Zodo, entertains the elderly, the young and the disabled—anyone who is in need of cheering up. A visit from Norm as Zodo never fails to achieve this end. Norm also spends a lot of time as Santa or the Easter bunny, visiting kinders, schools, nursing homes and hospitals—any special occasion and Norm is there in his trusty

        in full costume to please and delight. It is quite a sight to see Zodo the clown zipping around Waverley in his MG.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm is always on call to help and respond whenever asked. Off his own bat, he travelled to Portsea to visit the Kosovo refugees when they were here, as he knew the children could do with cheering up. Norm is very active to this day with Very Special Kids, the Down Syndrome Association,

        </a>
        , the Rotary Club of Waverley, the Child and Family Care Network, the Monash volunteers association and many more we do not even know about. Norm has been actively involved in the Monash City Council for many years, where he served as councillor and mayor in its previous incarnation as the Waverley City Council, and attends all council meetings. You cannot go to a Monash City Council meeting and not see Norm in the audience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm is the most worthy recipient of this award and I cannot sing his praises highly enough. Quite simply, Norm is one of the reasons Waverley is such a great place to live in. It was an absolute delight to hear that he was awarded the Premier’s Senior of the Year award for 2006. I know it was an absolute privilege and delight and the making of his life. We should all bear in mind that Norm is a spritely 79.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two other people in my electorate were also nominated for these awards: Marion MacKenzie, who is 93 and attends

        . Without these sorts of volunteers in our electorates, in our communities, our communities would not be the great places they are. We often talk about community being dead, but I know it is not because I have such great people in my electorate who are giving of their time generously as volunteers. I would like my remarks in

        to show the great respect I have for these individuals.
