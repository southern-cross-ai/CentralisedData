       <p>
        We've always known that Labor governments are weak on national security. Last week, the High Court overturned a 20-year-old precedent that has underpinned the immigration policy of governments on both sides. As a result, in the weeks since the decision, the government has released 83 hardcore criminals into the community. including child sex offenders and murderers, who are the scum of the earth. But they have failed to introduce legislation to fix this issue. One of the released criminals is a violent sex predator with a record of attacking elderly women in their own homes, and a judge branded him as a danger to the Australian community. Another released criminal was sentenced in 2018 to over seven years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of rape and one of sexual assault.
       </p>

        Whilst the coalition welcomes the government's belated commitment to introduce legislation this week, it shouldn't have taken a week for the government to actually focus on the safety of the Australian community. You might be asking: where is the Prime Minister, while his government and its weak policies and weak track record on national security fall apart? Once again, he is overseas, acting like everything is okay. The people in my community are worried about the message the Labor government is sending by releasing these 83 hardcore criminals. It's too little too late. The Labor government will always be weak on national security, and Australians know that.
