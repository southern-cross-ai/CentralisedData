        I'd like to acknowledge Bob and Judith Little, who for over 40 years have owned and run the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPAR" rel="nofollow">
         SPAR
        </a>
        supermarket in Maclean and who are now retiring. The business has won numerous local and national awards for their store and customer service. In 2015 they won SPAR's eastern region store of the year, grocery department of the year and produce department of the year. In 2017 they won the excellence in retail category at the Northern Rivers Regional Business Awards. In 2018 they won the grocery excellence award again, the community and customer service excellence awards and the store investment award. For three consecutive years before that, they won the SPAR store of the year. In 2019 they won the Spiro Notaras Lifetime Achievement Award at the Clarence Valley Business Excellence Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're also wonderful community-spirited people. I was with them this year when they were given life membership of the Maclean Show. Bob and Judith are not only great business people but wonderful community people. Bob and Judith love Maclean and Maclean loves them. I wish them every enjoyment in retirement, but something tells me that they'll both still be very busy.

        It was wonderful to watch our Olympians a couple of months ago at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Tokyo Olympics
        </a>
        . It reminded me that my home is home to some of Australia's best athletes, including Athol McQueen, our very own international boxing champion from Kyogle. Athol had 86 fights. He won 70 and lost 16. Of the 16 losses, four of them were international or world championship bouts. He competed in the men's heavyweight event at the 1964
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Summer Olympics
        </a>
        in Japan. He defeated Tadayuki Maruyama of Japan, before losing to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Frazier
        </a>
        of the United States in the quarterfinal. Athol was, famously, the first person to knock heavyweight champion Joe Frazier to the canvas. Athol personally knew greats from this period, like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali" rel="nofollow">
         Muhammad Ali
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Foreman" rel="nofollow">
         George Foreman
        </a>
        , just to name two. After his career, Athol had his own road construction business, a cream run from the local dairy farm, and later worked with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks" rel="nofollow">
         National Parks
        </a>
        and Wildlife. In 2009 he was inducted into the Queensland Boxing Hall of Fame. For many years, he remained involved in boxing in the local scene as a judge and referee. Married to Gloria, they had six children between them. Athol, you are a champion in many ways: you are a champion boxer and you are a champion for our community, and I thank you.
