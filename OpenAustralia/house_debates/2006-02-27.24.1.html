       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge on the public record the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Lifesaving_Championships" rel="nofollow">
         World Lifesaving Championships
        </a>
        that were held at Lorne and at Geelong over the last two weeks. These championships demonstrate the skills of lifesavers both in the ocean and in flat water. I particularly was surprised at the number of Europeans, Americans and other world nations that participated in the flat water lifesaving activities. Those of us in the electorate of Corangamite are dominated by surf lifesaving. There has been a long tradition of saving Australians from deepwater undercurrents and those types of difficulties. However, these world championships were very successful. I attended a luncheon yesterday at the conclusion. Competitors from something in the vicinity of 25 nations have been competing in the last two weeks.

        I put on the public record the contribution of Mr Harry Windmill, who was a major contributor over the last 30 years to the development of these championships. Unfortunately he passed away just five weeks ago, on the eve of these championships which were going to be held in Australia. That is a showpiece for the Australiana in surf lifesaving, surfboat rowing, ski rowing and that very important concept.
