        Each year it is a great privilege and honour for me to be given the opportunity to officiate at the

        . The conferring of citizenship upon people can be a tremendously gratifying experience as the joy in the individual who becomes an Australian feeds into your own soul. It is an emotional moment, but the real depth of feeling did not become apparent to me until I read the following letter from one of our newest Australians, Gillian Robinson of Sussex Inlet. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to share her letter with the House. Gillian writes:

        It is a story covering a 70 year period!

        I was born in Uganda in 1933 of British Colonial Civil Servant parents, finally leaving to return to Britain at the end of

       <p class="italic">
        In Uganda, when I was 7 years old, my father read to my brother and myself, as a bedtime story, a book he had been awarded in 1914, at the age of 11, in Blackheath, England as a school Arithmetic prize.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That book, which I now own, was ‘Timothy in Bushland’ by

        I was enthralled by the story and made up my young mind that I would one day find my way to Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The years passed and I traveled and lived in many countries until at last in 1989 my daughter came to Australia as a back-packer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I saved up all my annual leave and ‘time-in-lieu’ from work and finally flew to Australia to spend six weeks at Christmas and the

        It was, as I thought, the only opportunity I would ever have to see the country which had inspired my childhood dream and it did not disappoint!

        I was photographed on the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More years passed, circumstances changed and after previously spending two years on an ‘exchange’ visit, in 1999 my daughter together with her husband and three young children emigrated from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to Australia to live in Nowra.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I visited as a tourist time and time again. Finally, with the encouragement of my son and daughter, I decided to try to emigrate in the ‘aged parent’category and on being accepted, waited on my Bridging Visa for 7 years, before being given my

        The culmination of this life time’s “dream of Australia” was the ceremony at Sussex Inlet on Australia Day, 26th January 2011, when I was at last granted my Australian Citizenship, thus proving that you should never give up on a dream, even a dream of 70 years duration!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My thanks are due to my son and his wife and to my daughter and her husband for their encouragement in my adventure towards my dream.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To Mr and Mrs Ross Westley of Sussex Inlet Lions Club, to Joanna Gash MP who awarded me my Citizenship, to Shelley Hancock MP, the Lions Club dignitaries and members and to all the other new Citizens, all of whom contributed to the success of a very special day.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, I will let those words speak for themselves.
