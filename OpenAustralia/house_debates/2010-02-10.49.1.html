        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Given that the peak industry body representing electrical and communications contractors took the extraordinary step of alerting him in writing about the fire and electrical dangers surrounding the government’s Home Insulation Program, why did it take seven weeks for one of his departmental officials to bother replying? Given the serious and highly credible nature of this warning, what advice was requested by the minister or his office from officials on this issue? What immediate action did the minister take then to ensure that the safety warnings were heeded, and what other safety warnings did the minister or his department receive from industry groups? Would the minister make a full statement to this House about what warnings he received, when he received them, what action he took and when he took it?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am pleased to advise the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, about the consultation process that has been a central feature of this program and continues to be so. I can advise the House that at a roundtable in February 2009 industry expressed a desire for a national unit of training to be developed for installers of insulation, recognising that this is an industry that previously had no dedicated training program. My department responded to this advice and contracted the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council, the peak training body for the industry, in consultation with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEEWR" rel="nofollow">
          DEEWR
         </a>
         , to develop training materials for the safe and effective rollout of insulation in accordance with the Australian standards and as required under the guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following that, CPSISC—I beg your pardon, there are many acronyms here—the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council, consulted widely with relevant industry organisations, including the insulation sector, the

          Order! I take it by the questions that there is some interest in this subject; it is a serious matter. By the tone of interjections there is an allusion as to why these things are serious. I would think, therefore, that the minister should be heard in silence.

          <p>
           In addition, the industry skills council developed a pocketbook to support the training package, and that pocketbook warns explicitly of the dangers of electricity—that stapling live wires to joists can be life threatening—and that advice from a licensed electrical contractor should be sought. As I have consistently said, I will not hesitate to boost training requirements, safety standards and compliance measures under this program. That is what I have done today and that is what I did last year as well in order to have a program that meets the Australian standards, or exceeds them, as it does, and fully conforms to the advice that we have received and that I have received from my department in this matter. I am further in a position—

Whether there are other documents has been raised as a question and I have asked the minister. The minister has indicated that he was not. This is the way in which these matters have been handled in the past.
