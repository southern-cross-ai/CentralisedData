       <p>
        Forty-three years ago my husband and I moved to Mildura for his internship at the Mildura Base Public Hospital. One of the first specialists we met was a man called Kevin Chambers, a general surgeon and a friendly true blue Aussie. Kevin was a mentor, giving his time and expertise to many junior doctors who would follow him around the wards, feeding off his kind and excellent sense of humour. He became a stalwart in the region's local medical profession and could always be relied on for his witticism and dry humour. He cared for several members of my family and thousands of local families with dignity, respect and compassion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks ago, Kevin, sadly, passed away. One of his final actions was to ensure another surgeon would promise to take his place to serve the people of Sunraysia. This was the type of man Kevin was. It was never about him; it was about meeting the needs of his patients and the strengthening of the local health system. Bridging the divide between rural and metropolitan healthcare delivery was a driving force in Kevin's life and career.
       </p>
       <p>
        I too am passionate about regional and rural health care. I've made no secret of it and I will continue to wear out the carpet to Minister Hunt's office to fight for improved healthcare delivery in Mallee. I hope Kevin's example will inspire young doctors in our region to take up the torch ignited by one of the best surgeons our region has ever seen.
