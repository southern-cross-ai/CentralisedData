        The title of the aged-care royal commission interim report says everything about this government's approach to aged care. The title was simply one word,
        <i>
         Neglect
        </i>
        , and the findings of the aged-care royal commission point to a government that has neglected the sector for many years. The findings are quite shocking: almost half of residents in aged-care facilities are malnourished, there is inappropriate use of drugs and restraints, and there is a lack of care and respect for residents. There are almost 100,000 Australians on a waiting list for aged-care packages throughout this country, most of them looking for a high level of support. Twenty-eight thousand Australians died whilst waiting for an aged-care package over the course of the last couple of years, on this government's watch.

        Yesterday I met with age-care workers who are overworked and underpaid. They talked about lonely residents who just want the workers to sit with them and give them some company. But the workers have no time to do so, and they're often disciplined by management for taking the time to do it. Despite working shift work and weekends, many of them still struggle to make ends meet and have a second job. If this government won't respect aged-care workers, how are they expected to deliver the care that our elderly deserve?
       </p>
       <p>
        The royal commission made a series of recommendations, and this government is ignoring them. I call on this government to respect elder Australians and to pay workers in the aged-care sector what they deserve.
