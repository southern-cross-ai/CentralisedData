       <p>
        Today I want to speak about a vision, a vision I have had for a number of years and since I have come into this place. People in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , in particular at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgerys_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Badgerys Creek
        </a>
        , are inhibited from realising their full potential. The people out at Badgerys Creek have had their lives on hold for over 30 years because of planning laws associated with a proposed airport being built there or not being built there. From time to time they have put in proposals to do extensions so they can have a second family in their homes—so their children can live in their homes—realise the value of their homes, sell their homes and maybe buy an education for their kids at university or do something else. But, unlike many other Australians in this country, they are unable to do this.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are unable to do this because of simple planning laws that have been put in place by both the federal and state governments and the local councils. As a consequence, their lives are on hold. They live in a house that they can do nothing with and they live on property they can do nothing with. My vision, which I put forward to the government before the last election and have been harping on about for a long time, is that we actually allow them to do something with their properties. We are either going to or not going to build an airport there. If we are not going to build an airport there then we need this to be translated through to local council and the state government so that they can change their planning laws and these people can get on with their lives. I suggested that the second airport be at either Williamstown airport in Newcastle or in Canberra—with the Canberra airport becoming a truly international airport—linked by a very fast train. The money to pay for this infrastructure would come from the sale of the Badgerys Creek property. As a result of that, benefits would go to not only the people of Sydney, by there being a second Sydney airport, but also the people of either Canberra or Williamstown.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know these things have been flagged in the past and many people have spoken about them, but the bottom line is that there has been absolutely no action on this issue—no action by past governments and no action by this government on this issue. I have relayed this message to the transport minister before this date on numerous occasions and still we see no action. Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask you and I plead with the people of this House to please understand the case of the people living on these properties. Please let us see some action on these vital infrastructure programs so that we can see some growth in Western Sydney, a reversal of the traffic trends heading from Western Sydney into Sydney and some realisation of the potential of the people and the properties in Western Sydney. Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask you to please help me, work with me and work with your colleagues to try and push this issue forward so that the people in those areas, the people of Western Sydney, can realise the true potential that this place has to offer for them.
