        Recently I gave the commemorative address at the Penrith city sub-branch of the Australian National Servicemen's Association. With this year marking 50 years since Australia's participation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        was formally declared ended by the then Governor-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Paul_Hasluck" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Paul Hasluck
        </a>
        , it was particularly poignant. I came across the words of a poem
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tour" rel="nofollow">
          The Tour
         </a>
        </i>
        by a serviceman, Paul Zaat. I would like to read the first and last verses:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We left our shores in '69, not knowing our fate at the time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We were young and spirited, full of life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This journey of ours would lead to strife.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The day had come to say goodbye, from airports and wharves the flag did fly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Family and friends showed us much love, with tears in their eyes they looked above.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the jets flew past, with such a roar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Would it be the last time they saw, their sons, brothers, fathers leaving for war?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As distance gathered between them and us, we looked at each other "Why all the fuss?!"
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Heading to a land far away, to an unknown war to this day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Reg's, the Nasho's together as one, carrying their packs and a brand-new gun.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … … …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We were brothers in arms to say the least, the mates we lost,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        May they rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On arrival home no words (of war) were spoken, some battered, some bruised with spirits broken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Family and friends gave us support, with little knowledge of the war we fought.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With pain and anger in my heart, I longed for the day and a fresh new start.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Lest we forget.
       </p>
       <p>
        What a contrast those words are: the hope of young men, barely adults, setting out on an adventure across the sea to an unknown fate—to the heartache of war and pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those in my community who fought in Vietnam: thank you for being so brave, for putting your commitment to serve our country above anything else. Fifteen thousand nashos served: 1,200 were injured and 200 made the greatest sacrifice. That included Errol Noack, the very first servicemen to be killed in Vietnam. He was 21 years old and just 10 days into his service. 'I don't want to go to war, but I must obey the call to duty; I will go and do my best,' he said. Our youngest and most strong and dedicated were called upon to serve their country in a conflict that was far from our shores. They had great courage and resilience, and they demonstrated their bravery and determination in the face of great adversity. They showed the world what it means to be an Australian: to stand up for what is right; to fight for freedom and democracy; and to serve our country with honour and distinction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The war had a profound impact on Australia, both in terms of its military and its society. This was not the first time we had sent troops to fight in a foreign conflict not directly related to the defence of our nation. Today, 50 years on, the scars of that battle, the divisive reaction at home and abroad and the challenges of readjusting to everyday life are still carried by many.
       </p>
       <p>
        An anniversary of 50 years is a time of reflection and remembrance for all who were affected by this conflict. We remember the sacrifices made by our troops and their families. We remember their courage and determination. And we honour their service and sacrifice, not just on this day but every day—and we also must continue to learn from it. In the world today, when we're experiencing such global uncertainty in a way that many of us haven't experienced before, there's a sense of comfort in reflecting on the strength of those who fought under our flag in Vietnam to protect our nation, and on the wisdom of their experience. I call on young people today to learn from the collective experience of those who have served—we must not forget. I also call on them to be inspired; their sense of honour and duty is an inspiration to us all. The poem continues:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, to leave this god forsaken place, the excitement could be seen on everyone's face.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We had served our "country" as requested, we fought and toiled and never rested.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By air and sea, we left for home, together as one and never alone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We were brothers in arms to say the least, the mates we lost,
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to nashos' president, Harry May, and to all our wonderful local nashos who served us so brilliantly. May everyone who we lost rest in peace.
       </p>
