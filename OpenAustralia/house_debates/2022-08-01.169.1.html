       <p>
        I recently met with a group of seniors in my electorate who have arrived in Australia from India under the contributory parent visa program. Some of the most pressing challenges they raised with me were issues of social isolation, the lack of community support networks and the pressure of adjusting to a new environment and creating a new place to call home. Although they are incredibly happy to be here and to join their families in Australia, many, unfortunately, are struggling in a way which impacts their families who are already here. Some of the difficulties are around access to and affordability of public transport, access to social activities and interactions with the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the efforts of our community in helping to put these issues on the agenda, and I want to pay tribute to the many organisations in my electorate working to create culturally appropriate avenues of support. In doing so, I commend the work of Nayana Bhandari and the Oorja Foundation, who are dedicating their time to these aged parents from India to help them feel a little bit more at home and to help them connect with many other people in their community. For my part, I look forward to continuing our conversation with this group of seniors in my electorate and to working with other members of the Indian community not only to put forward and raise their issues of concern but also to find solutions for their problems.
