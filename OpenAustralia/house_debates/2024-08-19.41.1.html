        home are Carol Marando and Jon Ellis. Carol and Jon met while on a painting trip through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Australia
        </a>
        during the nineties. They were both developing their artistic skills and taking inspiration from the colours and landscapes of the Australian outback. Settling in together on the Central Coast, Carol and Jon raised their two children in the region and have both established successful arts enterprises. For 20 years, Carol produced exquisite jewellery which was sold throughout Australia and the world. She was also involved with glass bead making, having learned many of these skills through her fine arts education after school. Nowadays, Carol is an excellent ceramic potter, with many of her works highly treasured. Carol and Jon both continue to have very successful professional lives. Jon holds weekly art classes in his home studio space and teaches painting at the Gosford Regional Gallery. Carol also divides her time between her private practice and the latest passion, ceramics. You'll find Carol selling her works at the Mousehole and at 5 Lands Artists Collective's stall at the Avoca markets. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Carol Marando and Jon Ellis on their services to arts on the Central Coast and throughout Australia. Thank you for making our community a brighter and more exciting place to live.
