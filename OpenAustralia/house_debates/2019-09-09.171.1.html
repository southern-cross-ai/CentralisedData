        I rise to speak about surf lifesaving clubs, an enormous part of the lifestyle and culture on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        and home to many of the beautiful beaches in the world, many of which make up the eastern boundary of Moncrieff electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a Gold Coaster for 18 years, training for a bronze as a surf lifesaver at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Mermaid Beach
        </a>
        Surf Club was indeed a highlight. The team, now headed by President Ann Donnelly-Marshall and Deputy President Pete Degnian, does a great job at our club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to mention life member Dave Zemek and his family, Judy and Benn, who support him after Dave's heartbreaking accident in the surf at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        a year ago, which saw him confined to a wheelchair.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the contribution that the coast's 22 surf clubs—and the nine in my electorate—made to last year's record of zero deaths on our beaches. I commend North Burleigh, Miami,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobby's_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Nobby's Beach
        </a>
        , Mermaid Beach, Kurrawa, Broadbeach, Northcliffe,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfers_Paradise" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Southport for their ongoing work to keep our beaches safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coast beach culture means our surf clubs attract people from all walks of life. No matter where you're from, the focus is on doing the work required to ensure the sustainability of the club and to promote a community spirit of inclusiveness and safety. Our club volunteers roll up their sleeves to fundraise, attend to administrative duties and patrol beaches to save lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of this month, we'll start to see around 5,000 nippers running around on the sand and into the surf. This is a fundamentally important program run by surf clubs that teaches our next generation how to stay safe in the water. As we come to the peak season for our beaches, I wish to thank our volunteer surf lifesavers and club members who do so much for our city and Moncrieff.
