        , vice-patron and life member of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, Olympian at the Helsinki games, founding father of the Cronulla Sutherland Water Polo Club, dedicated teacher and mentor, loving husband to Shirley for almost 57 years, devoted father, grandfather and great-grandfather to Robyn, Jenny, David and their families and a great mate and friend to all those who had the pleasure and privilege to know him.

        Last Friday I joined with our community at the Woronora cemetery to pay tribute to Frank. Frank grew up in Bankstown, less than a mile away from the local pool. His swimming journey took him to Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, where he gained his

       <p>
        Frank's competitive achievements in the surf were the forerunner to decades of service as a coach and a mentor, enabling hundreds of young shire athletes to realise their potential and learn some important life lessons from Frank along the way. In 1964, Frank convened a meeting at Cronulla to form what is now the Cronulla Sutherland Water Polo Club, which has produced Olympians and champions from

        , who joins me here today, Frank Jordan swam a good race with honesty, integrity and authenticity. His life was one of vigilance and service in the great tradition of Australian surf lifesaving. To Shirley and all her family, I express my sympathies and condolences but most of all the thanks of a grateful shire community for Frank's faithful life of service. You knew him in his greatest roleâ€”a great family man. There is no greater achievement for a man than that.
