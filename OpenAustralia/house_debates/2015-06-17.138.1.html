       <p>
        I rise today to update the House about two events I recently attended, which highlighted the community spirit that is evident in my electorate of Swan. I have spoken in this place before about the Belmont Toy Library, which was located at the Redcliffe Park Community Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2003, the toy library has provided an important service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Belmont" rel="nofollow">
         City of Belmont
        </a>
        community, bringing families together who have a common interest, from all walks of life, whilst also fostering early learning and social interaction or, simply put: the importance of playtime for our children.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012, I began a campaign with former City of Belmont councillor, Glenys Godfrey, who is now the state member for Belmont, to assist this community facility in finding a new location, as they had reached their full capacity at the Redcliffe site with 35 member families. Although Glenys and I worked to assist the toy library to find a new location, the not-for-profit organisation would never have been established or expanded if it had not been for the work of its committee members—in particular, Angela Holmes, Heather Forrester and Julie-Anne Beasley.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased to update the House that not only does the Belmont Toy Library have a new home at the recently renovated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Park
        </a>
        community and recreation centre—which was funded by the WA state government—but also the toy library's facility has been purpose built to meet its needs. I recently attended the toy library's family fun day and annual general meeting, aimed at promoting the great community organisation and encouraging new members. It was a great success, with many local people attending. I congratulate the Belmont Toy Library committee—and, in particular, its president, Heather Forrester—for their dedication and service to the community. I thank the WA Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
         Colin Barnett
        </a>
        , for providing the necessary funding for this facility, which will ensure the toy library has a permanent home, with the ability to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take time to highlight another person who has dedicated his life to the service of the Swan community and the service of our nation. I am sure members in this place would either know or have heard of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Grayden" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Grayden
        </a>
        , who served the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        , as the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Swan
        </a>
        , from 1947 to 1949, before being elected to this place as the member for my electorate of Swan from 1949 to 1954. From 1956 to 1993, Bill returned to the legislative assembly to serve as the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         South Perth
        </a>
        , which is also in Swan. Last week I attended a dinner, hosted by my Swan division, to celebrate the achievements and service of Bill, and it was also attended by the Premier, who spoke highly of Bill Grayden.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Bill on everything he has achieved throughout his life as a parliamentarian. Bill gave us a few insights into how he won the seat for Middle Swan, in 1947, as a 27-year-old. He said he printed up a 16-page booklet, which he handed out to all the constituents of Middle Swan, detailing the achievements of the sitting Labor member—all the pages were blank. He won the seat of Middle Swan, and that is the only time it has ever been held by the Liberals, before it was lost as part of the legislative assembly.
