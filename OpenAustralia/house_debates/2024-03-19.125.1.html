        Today I want to take a few moments to remember a passionate advocate within my electorate of Adelaide, within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and, in fact, nationally. She was a cancer advocate and a local in my area, Ms Lorraine Tyler. Sadly, Lorraine Tyler recently left us, after battling lung cancer. My heartfelt condolences extend to the entire lung cancer community; Lorraine's partner, Kirsten; her family and friends; and the Lung Foundation Australia lung cancer patient advisory group, which Lorraine chaired. In her memory, I'm going to read Lorraine's words. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2017 I was diagnosed with two primary cancers; breast cancer and lung cancer. I was not experiencing symptoms of either cancer. The breast cancer was picked up early, through screening, and was cured through two surgeries. A devastating diagnosis but an excellent outcome. Unfortunately the lung cancer was only found by accident, it had already spread, and it will most likely kill me. I wish there had been a lung cancer screening program in place to find my cancer early, just like the breast cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lorraine spoke with conviction on the importance of both the need for specialist lung cancer nurses and a targeted lung cancer screening program. While Lorraine herself was unable to access the potentially life-saving National

        Screening Program, committed to launch in 2025, Lorraine knew the positive impact it would have on so many other Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we commemorate Lorraine's passing, let's also celebrate the legacy that she leaves behind: a legacy of advocacy, inspiration and a commitment to others. Lorraine Tyler was awarded the

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , for service to the community through a range of roles but primarily through advocating for early screening of lung cancer. In celebrating Lorraine's life, we acknowledge the profound legacy she leaves behind. She was a force for good, a catalyst for change and a beacon of hope.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lorraine will be remembered first and foremost for her tremendously positive outlook on life, one that was not defined by cancer. Her passion for screening and early detection to save lives has been noted by many in this place, including members of the Parliamentary Friends of Lung Health and Lung Cancer and ministers, many of whom noted meeting Lorraine as a clarion moment in advocacy and a wake-up call that lung cancer patients deserve better. Along with so many other things, the funding of specialist lung cancer nurses and the targeted Lung Cancer Screening Program are a part of her legacy. May she rest in peace.
