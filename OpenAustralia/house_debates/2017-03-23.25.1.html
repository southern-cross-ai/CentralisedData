       <p>
        On Sunday just gone, something wonderful happened in the middle of my electorate. On
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Central Avenue
        </a>
        , the wonderful and larger-than-life Vince Garreffa and his lovely wife Anne hosted the 21st Aspinall Family fundraising brunch. I tell you what, Deputy Speaker, you could not move for those who were there to either donate to the wonderful cause of Lifeline, for the wonderful 'Perth-onalities' that were around, for the celebrity chefs who were cooking the breakfast to make sure that everyone who was there was in a terrific position to donate to this amazing charity that had been supported by Vince and Anne over 21 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was supported not only by Vince and Anne but by another icon of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        community. Of course, that person was Graham Mabury, the host of 33 years' of the 6PR
        <i>
         Nightline
        </i>
        family, as we have come to be known. And, of course, there was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verity_James" rel="nofollow">
         Verity James
        </a>
        , who did a wonderful job of keeping things moving along.
       </p>
       <p>
        The auction started, and did it what! Over the last 21 years Vince and Anne, the Mondos team, the
        <i>
         Nightline
        </i>
        team and Perth community have raised over $2 million for Lifeline. Due to some fast and furious auctioneering and some lovely, warm and generous hearts—and wallets!—of the Perth community, I am very proud to acknowledge that Vince and Anne and the team raised over $403,000 on Sunday morning for Lifeline—a wonderful cause to help prevent suicide. Well done, Vince and Anne. Well done, team.
