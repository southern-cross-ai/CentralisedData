        ; his sons, Mark and David, and their respective families; and his brother, Tom, and his family. Llew was the member for Ipswich for the Liberal Party from 1972 to 1983. He started his working life as an electrician in the family business,

        The Edwards family and the Neumann family have known each other through church and community life for generations. Sir Llew and I were clearly on different sides of politics. I acknowledge his immense contribution to the city of Ipswich in Queensland. He was a decent and honourable man in a conservative government that did not always live up to his own standards of integrity. Then Labor Premier Anna Bligh named him one of six Queensland Greats in 2010. Vale, Sir Llew Edwards. Thank you for your service to Ipswich and Queensland.
