       <p>
        I rise to draw the attention of the House to the impact that antisocial behaviour, crime, even things like graffiti, and the pervading presence of drugs has on families in the communities in Wakefield and, I dare say, all around Australia. This is a problem that will only get worse because of the increase in the use of amphetamine type stimulants. That use has increased substantially over the last five years. The number of clandestine drug laboratories detected has gone up from some 150 in 1999-2000 to 381 in 2004-05. These are particularly dangerous and harmful drugs because of their effects on people, leading them to violence. In fact, on that point, I welcome the Howard government’s Tough on Drugs policy because there is no such thing as a so-called recreational or party drug. They are illicit drugs—they are dangerous and harmful—and we must send a consistent message.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        police—particularly people like Superintendent Ferdi Pitt and the police in the Elizabeth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSA" rel="nofollow">
         LSA
        </a>
        —are doing a fantastic job, but governments need to support them. The South Australian government needs to put more resources into supporting the police. I notice that this year’s budget identified a staggering 82 per cent underspend in the police recruiting program at a time when constituents in Wakefield are consistently telling me that they need to see more police patrols, more police presence, more police on the streets. The problem is not going to get better. According to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAPOL" rel="nofollow">
         SAPOL
        </a>
        annual reports, over 40 per cent of their members are aged between 40 and 54 years of age, which means that with the ageing of the population a large number will retire in the future, so recruitment really needs to be addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not all bad news. I am pleased to say that the Australian government is increasing the size of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        and is particularly putting a focus on amphetamine type stimulants, which are the cause of so much of the crime and fear in our communities. As recently as January this year, some 1,900 litres of a key ecstasy precursor was seized in Sydney. The amount that was seized would have led to some $540 million worth of tablets going out onto the streets. But for them to continue to have that sort of success, cooperation with state police forces is essential, which means that, in this case, the South Australian police force needs to have the resources to do the job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal efforts to reduce the amount of drugs have been recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_on_Drugs_and_Crime" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
        </a>
        . The executive director, who is currently visiting Australia, has noted that Australia’s success in curbing addictions for all kinds of narcotics is remarkable. This initiative will continue. It has been consistent over the last 10 years. The Howard government has put a total of some $1.4 billion into reducing the demand, supply and effect of drugs. It is not just stopping there, though. We also seek to partner with local communities to empower them to the maximum extent possible to address crime in their local communities. The Community Crime Prevention Program provides funding for projects that are aimed at reducing crime or antisocial behaviour, improving community safety and security, and reducing the fear of crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the comments that I have heard from people include that they are concerned about things like the lack of values, the lack of respect and the behaviour of young people. The government have funded two projects in Wakefield. One is in partnership with Anglicare and the City of Playford: $499,000 to go to a series of projects for eight to 18-year-olds, operating between 4 pm and 6 pm, targeting young people at risk of offending. Activities are run across a number of sites in Elizabeth. There is Good Beginnings Australia, and some $498,000 was granted to the Elizabeth Connect Turn Around Program, which is a program targeted at young children and students that extends beyond the boundaries of the classroom. A small grants program is now open so that small community groups can apply for funding for security equipment: security lights, window bars et cetera. Councils can apply for funding for graffiti awareness. Up to $150,000 has been given to councils for things like graffiti awareness education campaigns. I encourage the community in Wakefield to partner with the Australian government. We are prepared to put in more resources. We look for those opportunities to work with you to reduce the impacts of crime in our communities.
