        I am pleased to reflect on more good news for Bass, with the announcement last week of just under $150,000 worth of projects for my community. These high-quality projects will improve recreational, sporting, cultural and community facilities. Successful projects included: the installation of filtered-water drinking-fountains in four key locations across Launceston: Cataract Gorge Reserve, Heritage Forest Reserve, Punchbowl Reserve and the Inveresk cultural precinct. We will also be removing and replacing old and unstable roofing materials at the Launceston City Mission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project is equipping the new barbecue facility at Tailrace Park in Riverside, incorporating three free-to-use electric barbecues, seating and shelter. The project is led by the magnificent Riverside Lions Club, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. I congratulate Lion John Oldenhof, the project director and a tireless worker for our community.

        It is particularly noteworthy that round 2 of the Stronger Communities Program has been open for some time now. Expressions of interest can be registered at my office at 100 St John Street Launceston until Friday, 11 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased to advise the House that another four local businesses in Bass have received an Industry Skills Fund grant for staff training and to take advantage of new growth opportunities. The Brent Wrankmore Swim School received a grant to upskill with the latest available training. Australian Honey Products received a grant to improve the skills of their employees as part of a large business expansion. I am very proud of the owner, Lindsay Bourke, who last year won a prize in

        Finally, I would like to touch on recent news that four mobile phone black spots I nominated in Bass will be given priority for consideration in round 2 of the program. The four locations I nominated were: Killiecrankie and Palana on Flinders Island; Musselroe Bay;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Blackstone Heights
        </a>
        ; and Beechford-Lefroy. I know from speaking with residents how important reliable mobile phone services are, and I am delighted these areas will be given priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to say that we have achieved a lot in Bass during the last two years, but there is always more to do. I am currently distributing an electorate update to my community recalling the things that we have achieved together in the last two years. I thought I would touch on some of these things. They include $34 million for north-east freight roads; $10 million to save the John L. Grove rehabilitation centre; $6 million to develop
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bank" rel="nofollow">

        upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the greatest honour of my life to represent the people of northern Tasmania. I will continue working with them to build on our momentum, so our community can look to the future with even greater confidence.
