       <p>
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's 6th report of 2020—Referrals made in September and October 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The committee's sixth report for the year 2020 considered two proposals: one referred to the committee in September and the second in October 2020. The total value of the proposed works for the two projects was $113.7 million, with the projects being undertaken in Canberra and Adelaide.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is the Department of Health's proposed fit-out and new leased premises at Fairbairn Business Park in Canberra, with an estimated cost of $60.7 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . The department sought approval from the committee to relocate the Therapeutic Goods Administration's laboratory from its current location in Symonston, to a purpose-built laboratory at the Fairbairn Business Park. The proposal also includes the fit-out of the office space that will serve as the Department of Health's second

        </a>
        campus.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project is the Services Australia proposed fit-out of the new leased premises in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_William_Street" rel="nofollow">
         King William Street
        </a>
        in Adelaide, with an estimated cost of $53 million, excluding GST. This project will enable Services Australia to consolidate its five current Adelaide sites into one fit-for-purpose building at 52 to 62 King William Street, Adelaide. The project will save money by consolidation, but, importantly, will not impact on the public access as none of the sites being consolidated provide face-to-face service. In the current circumstances, the committee was unable to travel to Adelaide and inspect the proposed works in person and so undertook detailed scrutiny via a video presentation from Services Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of its statutory role under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the committee scrutinised each project considering the purpose of the work and its suitability, the need for the work, whether the money expended is cost-effective, whether any revenue is generated, and the present and prospective value of the work. In both cases, the committee recommended that it is expedient that the work be carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the remaining time to reflect on the work of the Public Works Committee during this year. In a typical year, the committee would undertake a very busy program of work, including travelling to the locations of the works and conducting site inspections. This is an important part of the work of the committee, being able to inspect the proposed works and hear from the entities and those who will be impacted by the project. This year, however, the committee had to change quickly to holding hearings via teleconference, and undertaking site inspections remotely via presentations. I would like to acknowledge all of the entities that were able to quickly develop these presentations, which made it possible for the committee to undertake its scrutiny. Going forward, and assuming conditions allow, the committee hopes to be able to travel to locations of works again to view the proposed works in question.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        , who were able to ensure that the important work of the committee could continue by facilitating referrals through the Governor-General. As the oldest continuing committee of the parliament, the committee takes its statutory role in scrutinising proposed public works very seriously. This is amply demonstrated by both the quality and the scrutiny it conducts, and the time frames in which this scrutiny takes place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all my colleagues on the committee for their hard work during the year, including my predecessor as chair, the Hon. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVeigh" rel="nofollow">
         John McVeigh
        </a>
        , and, most particularly, the deputy chair, the member for Makin, who stood in as acting chair in recent months. Without the tireless efforts of my fellow members, this focus on the effective expenditure of public money on public works would not be possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank the committee secretariat—the committee secretary, Pauline Cullen; the inquiry secretariat, Klara Fay; former inquiry secretary, James Bunce; and office manager, Tanya Pratt—for their terrific work during what has been a very difficult year for of all us. I commend the report to the House.
