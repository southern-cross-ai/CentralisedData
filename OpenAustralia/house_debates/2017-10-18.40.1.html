        From last Friday to Sunday in Gilmore, we fundraised and celebrated. Firstly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        of Milton District celebrated 70 years. I thank Sandy Aureli and all the committee for their hard work in our community. I hosted village visits in Ulladulla and 'Politics in the Pub' at the Marlin Hotel—thanks, Jared, for looking after us.

        On Saturday, I witnessed the Huskisson Walk4BrainCancer in memory of a beautiful local hero, Lachlan Thoroughgood. Congratulations to his mum, Leanne, and to Kids Korner for organising the walk, even in the rain, and for raising more than $9,000. Nowra Hill Public School celebrated their 150-year anniversary and hundreds attended their fair and colour run. There were games, petting zoos and all sorts of things, but the most important was dunking Mr Parrish! I did face painting with the magnificent McDonald's South Nowra crew to raise money for

        . Thanks to all the team for helping our community in every single way.

        Finally, on Sunday, we celebrated the commissioning of the Rex Pymble rescue vessel to honour Rex after 12,500 days of service in
