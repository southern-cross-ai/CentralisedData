        What a huge weekend it was in Victoria. I'd like to take a moment to congratulate the Andrews government on their landslide win over the weekend. A special mention to my state colleagues for their hard work in the re-election:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Green" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Mary-Anne Thomas, Ros Spence, Fionna Deppeler-Morton, Sally Brennan and Josh Bull. Josh Bull deserves a double congratulation because I hear his wife, Jas, is now pregnant and they're expecting their first child.
       </p>
       <p>
        From day one the campaign of the Victorian Labor and Liberal parties were miles apart. On the one hand,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        took his bus and his team out to visit a school. They were going out there, talking about building communities, and chatting to teachers, students and families about their plans for better education. Meanwhile, on the other hand, where did
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Guy" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Guy
        </a>
        go? He went straight to a prison. Fear is what drove the Liberal Party of Victoria. Mobster Matty used scare campaigns and dog whistles, while Andrews promised to deliver for all Victorians. The difference is tangible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor win goes to show what Australians want from their representatives. They want positive policies, not divisive politics. I hear the giggle from those who got five per cent primary in Victoria—one of those who was involved in why the National Party doesn't have party status in Victoria. The Andrews government win in Victoria was a rejection of the Liberal and National cuts to schools,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and hospitals. It was a rejection of their refusal to invest in renewables and work against climate change. It was a rejection of small-minded and nasty politics. It was the embrace of progressive values.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        is one of the fastest-growing communities in the nation. While the federal Liberal government ignores the needs of Victorians, this weekend our growing north sent a very clear message: the communities in McEwen will not accept second best.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both federally and on a state level, Labor is about delivering generational infrastructure projects, investing in health and investing in schools and recreation centres. The Andrews government is providing funding for new schools and kindies in the south of Gisborne, and overdue upgrades to recreational spaces in Sunbury. We as a Labor movement recognise the need to deliver for our community's growing needs. The Andrews government is committed to building new community hospitals in Sunbury, Craigieburn and the Whittlesea growth corridors. They are undertaking and planning to fix the Kilmore and Melbourne Road intersections at Gisborne, meaning families across McEwen will no longer be at risk of dangerous accidents, giving them the freedom to travel to work or school and to visit friends and family in safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Andrews government will deliver stage 2 of the Hurstbridge line upgrade, which will include a new train station and bus interchange at Greensborough. On top of that, we'll see the duplication of the track between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Diamond Creek
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_Glen" rel="nofollow">
         Wattle Glen
        </a>
        , which will see a train every 20 minutes between Hurstbridge and Wattle Glen. Thanks to the Andrews government the residents of Gisborne, Kyneton, Trentham, Romsey and Lancefield will see extra buses connecting their towns as well as providing much-needed funding for the long-awaited Macedon Ranges Regional Sports Precinct. Labor is working hard on policies that will deliver better lives for everyday Australians. It means getting the infrastructure and public transport up to scratch to meet the demand in booming areas like ours.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we've seen over the past few months via the Morrison government and the state opposition is that cuts, chaos and division do not and cannot win an election. Coalition cold-hearted fear campaigns are divisive and discriminate against members of our communities. It's nasty politics, and Australians have had enough. They want to see policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor are about keeping their promises. We're backing TAFEs, hospitals, schools and services across growing communities so that each and every Australian has the opportunity to grow and thrive across the nation. We're committed to handing a better deal onto the next generation. We want them to be able to secure an apprenticeship. We want them to be able to afford their first home. We want a cleaner environment for their future. A federal Labor government will bring universal preschool for three- and four-year-olds. We'll uncap university places and give every young Australian the opportunity to reach their full potential. We believe that a good education shouldn't be reliant on mum and dad's credit card. All Australians deserve a fair go. We on this side of the House are committed to focusing on the Australian people and strengthening our schools and hospitals. As a united team, Labor consistently delivers policies, cohesion, infrastructure and sound social values—building together, not tearing apart. That is the difference between us and the conservatives opposite. A Shorten Labor government will bring unity, stability, economic success and social progress. We're about making Australia a better place for all Australians.
