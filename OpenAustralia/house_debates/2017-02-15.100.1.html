        My question is to the Minister for Aged Careâ€”and may I congratulate you, Ken, on your appointment and say that it is a privilege to ask you this first question. Will the minister update the House on action the government is taking to address the impact of dementia within our community? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Bennelong for his ongoing interest in this issue. As he is aware, over 350,000 Australians experience dementia, and I appreciate his commitment to the work that we are doing around this area.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was disappointed this morning to see a statement from Labor indicating that support for a national strategy delivering a coordinated approach to dementia has been missing under the Turnbull Liberal government and that the work that we are currently doing is just paper. I want to share with you that we are working very closely with the sector, including Alzheimer's Australia and, in particular, Marie McCabe, who now brings a wealth of experience to Alzheimer's Australia, to co-design solutions and responses in the way that we treat Australians living with dementia and those in residential care. In particular, I want to indicate that in 2015 our government announced the first national strategy for dementia. We have been in the process of implementing that, in concert with those who are committed to making a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is anticipated that in early 2017 we will release the new National Strategic Framework for Chronic Conditions, which will move away from a disease-specific approach and provide a high level of guidance to facilitate a more effective and coordinated national response to chronic conditions, including dementia and its risk factors. We have continued with our work around research, with a $200 million grant and funding initiatives through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
          NHMRC
         </a>
         to undertake further research into the underlying causes of dementia, in order to find a cure in the long term that will alleviate the pressure that individuals and, in particular, family members experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year, in 2016-17, we are spending $52.2 million on dementia-specific support programs. These include a suite of dementia consumer support services delivered by Alzheimer's Australia, which includes a helpline, information counselling, early intervention courses, career education and awareness-raising activities. The dementia training program offers accredited education upskilling and professional development to health, allied health, aged-care and community care professionals. The Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service provides support to aged-care workers, health professionals and family carers who need help in caring for someone who is experiencing the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, I want to compliment previous health ministers on our side who have committed to the work that we are undertaking with dementia and to the work that we are doing to make sure that we provide a better future and better opportunity for those experiencing and living with dementia.
