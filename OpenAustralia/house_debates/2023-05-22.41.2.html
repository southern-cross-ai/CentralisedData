        Last Friday night, the Penrith CBD was aglow with the Twilight Festival Penrith having returned. It was a magical night. Families came out in spite of the cold. There were thousands of people enjoying all that Penrith has to offer. I congratulate Gai Hawthorn and all of the team of Penrith CBD Corporation for putting on this really special family show. Local businesses, organisations and groups were involved. Everything about Penrith was all in this one space. There was live entertainment and local dance groups. The kids enjoyed everything. It's a reminder of how much we missed over those last couple of years, but it's also a reminder that Penrith and my community of Lindsay have the best community spirit in the country.

        I was so proud to have a stall there and catch up with people who just came up to say hello, take some photos and also let me know about what matters most to them, which is one of the most important parts of every single one of our jobs here in this place. My guessing competition lolly jar was a hit, and my team is busily working away at who will be the winner of that. I can't wait to announce that. One of my favourite things is Aussie flags. The kids love these, and I absolutely love the Penrith festival.
