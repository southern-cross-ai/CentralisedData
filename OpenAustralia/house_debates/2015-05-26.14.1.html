       <p>
        Seventy-four years ago this month, Australians and Cretans fought alongside each other against an oppressive Nazi regime despite overwhelming odds. I was deeply honoured to have been able to attend two events commemorating this significant chapter in our history as the representative of some 20,000 Greek-Australians in my electorate of Barton. As a fellow Greek-Australian, I pay my respects to the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for freedom.

         The Battle
        </a>
        of Crete and the Greek campaign are, unfortunately, not well known. Out of a total of 40,000 soldiers who made up the Allied and Greek forces, 3,990 were killed, 2,750 were wounded and 17,090 were captured. The 'Creforce', a union of Allied and Greek troops, bravely faced the oncoming German paratroopers. Together they fought valiantly, along with Cretan villagers who risked their lives providing food and shelter to those on the island. Both sides fought a desperate action that entailed stubborn determination and unrelenting bravery. It was an innovative campaign, and it was the first aerial invasion in warfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bravery of our troops, together with the brave Greek and, in particular, Cretan people, dealt a severe blow to the German morale. It is important that we honour the memories of those who have fallen or those who have passed on since. The heroism and persistence shown by our fellow Australians and Cretans have ensured that their deeds will always remain a part of our memory and our nation's history.
