        On Saturday 12 October my state colleague Sam Duluk MP and I joined the Unley Mercedes Jets Football Club, including President David Heaslip and his committee, players, coaches, volunteers and members and guests, to celebrate the end of a very successful season. There certainly was a lot to celebrate. The Unley Mercedes Jets Football Club was named the best-performing club of the season by the Adelaide Footy League. It is the only club to have won this award twice. The award recognises the club's success on and off the field, including match results, good behaviour on the field and administrative excellence. The award is a great credit to the players, members and volunteers of the club. I'd particularly like to recognise Club President David Heaslip for his outstanding leadership.

        Congratulations to the Jets A, B and C grades, who all finished as minor premiers this season, with all teams making the grand final and the B and C grades winning premierships. Sincere congratulations to the following players for being awarded the best and fairest for their divisions: A grade, Mitch Duval; B grade, Sam Ploenges; and C grade,

        . I would also like to recognise club member Brenton Westell, who received life membership of the club for his outstanding volunteer efforts. Personally I was proud to support the club this year with a $500,000 federal government grant to develop their clubrooms at Kingswood Oval. I look forward to the upgrade. Congratulations to the Unley Mercedes Jets Football Club on a fantastic season.
