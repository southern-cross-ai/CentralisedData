        On 1 September, I visited Nangus Public School to do an Investing in Our Schools project. In the 80-year history of the school, it has not had climbing, gross motor or fitness equipment. Additionally, the only play equipment that had been constructed by the P&amp;C over those many years was very old, weathered, splintery and dangerous. The Investing in Our Schools project was able to provide $33,000 for the construction of new play equipment. This has provided engaging mental challenges and great opportunities for fitness and for the development of motor skills, strength, self-confidence, agility and social interaction for the children.

        It was an absolutely splendid day. We had an assembly, which happens every week. The thing that most impressed me about the children at Nangus Public School was that during the assembly ceremony they all recite the citizenship oath. It was a great pleasure to see children from kindergarten to year 6 stand there and by heart recite the Australian citizenship oath. It was a fabulous morning. All of the parents, grandparents and general community members are able to come to Nangus Public School and join with the children and the head mistress in order to ensure that there are values in the public education system. This happens right across my electorate, but one great thing was that the Nangus Public School students were able to recite the citizenship oath off by heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        The morning was filled with musical items, with all of the children participating with great enthusiasm. We even had the builder who was providing some building works participate in that ceremony.

          I certainly did; we all sang. We sang the Australian national anthem with a bushman flavour. All of the children engaged very well in that whole episode. I would also like to mention the amount of trouble that the children went through to welcome their local member.

          even insisted that he should wear aftershave on a day he was meeting his local member. It was exciting for me to witness the great enthusiasm of the Nangus Public School students, to open that piece of playground equipment and to see all of the childrenâ€™s respect toward one another in utilising that playground equipment. I congratulate Nangus Public School for the way in which they carry out their duties toward their students.
