       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">
         YMCA
        </a>
        school in Kingston in my electorate and especially to mark the achievements of a very special group of students, parents and staff. It was a real honour to address these young people last Friday at a ceremony to honour the work they have put into their vocational training at the YMCA campus under the watchful eye of 'the two Garys' and some amazing teachers and supporters. I am also really pleased that the former Labor government was able to fund the trades training centre that the member for Blaxland and I announced on site during the election campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a whole range of reasons, the young people who attend the YMCA school have not had easy livesâ€”not by any stretch. Many of them did not have the best experiences at their previous schools. Whether these difficulties were imposed on them by circumstance or were the result of poor decisions in the past is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that they have picked themselves up and applied themselves to their learning and qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        I told them on Friday that everyone loves a comeback story and that they are truly 'the comeback kids' in our community. I am proud to honour their achievements in this place, and I am proud to represent them in this place.
