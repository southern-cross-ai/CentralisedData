       <p>
        by leave—Today as Minister for Defence I deliver an apology on behalf of the government to the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse in the course of service to the Australian Defence Force and their country. The men and women of the Australian Defence Force—past, currently serving and future—are entitled to be, and deserve to be, treated with the highest levels of admiration and respect, not just by the Australian people but also by fellow members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian defence organisation generally. These are the men and women who volunteer to serve their country, placing their country's safety and security above their own. They have left their families and their loved ones to train and serve, often in difficult and dangerous conditions. These are the men and women who are prepared to pay the highest cost in their commitment to their country and their duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Federation, the Australian military has rightfully held a high place in the regard of the Australian people. The Australian Defence Force is an organisation which has demonstrated the highest standards of professionalism, of courage and of sacrifice in peace and in wartime. But, terribly and sadly, the experience of some members of the Australian Defence Force over the years has not always reflected these high standards. Not all members of the Australian Defence Force have been treated with the necessary respect required to meet both common decency and these high standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFA" rel="nofollow">
         ADFA
        </a>
        Skype incident in April 2011, Australians have again seen stories emerge of sexual and other forms of abuse in Defence—shameful treatment by members of the Australian Defence Force of their own colleagues. These stories range from experiences in the 1950s right through to the present day. Young men and women have suffered treatment which no member of our defence force or our community generally should experience. Young men and women have endured sexual, physical or mental abuse from their colleagues, which is not acceptable and does not reflect the values of a modern, diverse, tolerant Australian society.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also seen claims that people who have occupied positions of trust in the Australian Defence Force and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        have abused that trust through their behaviour, including through the turning of a blind eye. Such experiences have had a lasting, serious and traumatic adverse impact on the people who have experienced them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also recognise that there are people in the Department of Defence who work alongside members of the Australian Defence Force in the service of Australia and in the service of our national interest. The Department of Defence is an institution which also seeks to uphold the highest values of ethics and behaviour. Sadly, men and women in the Department of Defence have also experienced abuse. In the aftermath of the ADFA Skype issue people have told me that after years of suffering from the memory of the abuse they experienced they seek recognition of their experience and an apology which acknowledges that it should never have occurred. To those men and women in the Australian Defence Force or the Department of Defence who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse, on behalf of the government I say sorry. You should never have experienced this abuse. Again, I say sorry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegations of abuse have been addressed in April through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLA" rel="nofollow">
         DLA
        </a>
        Piper review into sexual or other forms of abuse experienced. This process has seen a preliminary review of allegations from over 1,000 people. Action on these allegations will now be taken under the leadership of the Hon. Len Robert-Smith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        , a former justice of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Acknowledging the past and taking responsibility for it is only the first step. We must ensure that such abuse can never be tolerated again. We must place the safety and wellbeing of the young men and the young women of the Australian Defence Force above all else. The Australian Defence Force, the Department of Defence and their leadership are committed to change and to taking action to protect the young men and women in their care. This is best expressed through the Pathway to Change strategy adopted by Defence in March this year. It states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recent events and a suite of Reviews remind us that we need to ensure our people demonstrate exemplary behaviour commensurate with the nation's expectations, in and out of uniform, on and off duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have learnt, to our cost, that we do not consistently meet these high standards and, more worryingly, that our culture has tolerated shortfalls in performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will … take actions to shift attitudes and willingness to speak up when we become aware of inappropriate behaviour by a colleague in Defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government and the Defence leadership are committed to ensuring the ongoing reform and systemic change in Defence necessary for Defence to ensure zero tolerance into the future of such inappropriate conduct.
       </p>
       <p>
        This commitment is demonstrated by the presence in the House of the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, and the Secretary of the Department of Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
         Dennis Richardson
        </a>
        . General Hurley will himself release a statement of apology today to members of the Australian Defence Force. They are joined in the chamber by

       </p>
       <p>
        Our words today and our actions, and commitment into the future, will ensure that the apology given today in this House to those men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence, who have been subject to abuse, will never have to be repeated. I thank the House.

          Today in the House the coalition offers its strongest and unqualified support to the government as it offers a formal apology to the men and women of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          who have suffered abuse in the course of their service to our nation. Ours is a unique fighting force—a small but potent military that has delivered a disproportionate effect upon every battlefield on which we have fought. We have a rich military history and we can rightfully hold our heads high amongst the concert of nations when it comes to defending freedom. Our history of military endeavour is second to none. Yet despite this overwhelming battlefield success, there has been a flood of complaints, some going back to the 1950s, of abuse within the ranks.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our military personnel are our greatest asset. Their wellbeing will always be our No. 1 priority. Their care while serving our nation is not a price we pay; it is a duty we all undertake. By any standard, the litany of abuse allegations are completely unacceptable, let alone by the standards of the finest fighting force in the world, the ADF. This conduct does not accord with the values of our society let alone the values of our military. Our military is a disciplined force; however, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLA" rel="nofollow">
           DLA
          </a>
          Piper review has made it clear that there have been elements and individuals within the Defence Force who used their power or position and inflicted abuse on those who sought only to serve their nation. We deeply sympathise with and say sorry to those who have experienced abuse at the hands of those who were to be trusted with their leadership and their care. Theirs was a great betrayal.
         </p>
         <p>
          This abuse should never have happened and every effort must and will be made to ensure that it does not happen again. Our military must train hard and it must fight hard, but as they do we must not allow our men and women to suffer any type of abuse in any way. This is not who we are as a nation and certainly not who we are as a military. Abuse destroys lives, it limits our operational capability and it undermines public confidence in our Defence Force.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are always at our best when we pause, walk in the shoes of others and reflect on their experiences, when we acknowledge their pain and commit to right that which is wrong. This is the start of that journey. Accordingly, the government will enjoy the full support of the coalition as it establishes its Defence abuse task force and the process it undertakes. We will provide every support to senior Defence leadership and we have faith in their capacity to work with the task force to both assist it in its work and implement its recommendations. Today we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in our absolute commitment to care for those who care for us.
