        Football finals have gripped certainly Adelaide, my home city, as well as our country. It is great to celebrate some successes enjoyed by our local footy clubs in my electorate over the weekend as well as the big win by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Crows" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        finals. I know my colleagues behind me from WA are castigated by the Crows coming to challenge the Dockers and the

       <p>
        PHOS Camden are no doubt continuing to celebrate today after winning all three division 3 titles in the

        . Never before in the club's history have all three division 3 premierships been won, and it certainly was a great weekend for the Phantoms. As a club supporter, it was great to get along and cheer on the Phantoms.

        . The Bs' grand final was much tighter, with PHOS getting over the line by a point, and the Cs held on for nine-point win. Congratulations to Aaron Bergsman, who capped off a great season by also winning the division 3 association's best and fairest medal. Congratulations to President Paul Williams and the PHOS Camden Phantoms on a terrific season.

        I would also like to congratulate the Morphettville Park Roos women's team on going back to back and winning the 2015
