       <p>
        On Wednesday, 22 June the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox
        </a>
        community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        held an event to celebrate the work of their care services and recognise the numerous Greek Orthodox volunteer and community groups. The event was well attended by a large number of dignitaries, such as the Consul-General of Greece in Adelaide, Mr Andreas Gouras, and many members of the local Greek community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hindmarsh is home to a large Greek community, and it was pleasing to hear groups such as the Greek Pensioners and Aged Union of Thebarton and Suburbs were recognised for their work in the local community. I congratulate Mr Nick Flabouris, Mrs Porta Varkinis and Mr Jim Papanicolous for their great work. Nick andPorta hosted me only a few months ago for fine Greek coffee with the Greek pensioners, and I thank them for that. I am currently working with the Greek Pensioners and Aged Union of Thebarton and Suburbs as they look to raise funds to upgrade their community bus. The bus is used to transport elderly citizens to and from their medical appointments, for example, and so is much needed by the local residents. I look forward to assisting the group to make this dream of theirs a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event also coincided with the launch of a Let's Go Greek application for iPads and iPhones. It is a great idea to assist Greek-speaking people in the community to communicate with doctors, nurses and social workers. Other service providers will also be able to help in the health and ageing sector. Well done all in the Adelaide Greek community; I commend Mr Bill Gonis and the whole Greek Orthodox community for their work.
