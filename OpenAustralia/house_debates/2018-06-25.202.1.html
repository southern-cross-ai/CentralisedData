        One of the best things about being a federal member is being able to deliver vital infrastructure for our local community. Of course, vital infrastructure is what we're providing. In 2013, we promised a Gateway Upgrade North project, which is really important for Petrie residents, and I'm really pleased to say that this week the Deagon Deviation overpass opened. This will solve a lot of problems locally, because the new overpass will ease traffic congestion, making it easier for people who work in the city to get home.

        The overpass will also simplify the merge lanes. Previously people heading to Redcliffe were battling with people heading to

        going further into Bracken Ridge. So this new overpass for Redcliffe residents heading north on the

        </a>
        will make it simpler for them to get straight on the overpass and straight through to Redcliffe. This will improve safety and traffic flow. As with everything new, there have been you a few teething issues, with some better signage needed. I had a few people comment on the Facebook page, saying that better signage is needed. I'm talking to the state

        to make sure that that happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has been years in the making, and it's taken a lot of hard work, but it will make life much easier for those using the Gateway. Of course, the Gateway Upgrade North project will be completed by the end of 2018, and that's great for local people.
