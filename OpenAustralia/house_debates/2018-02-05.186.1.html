        As we welcomed in the year 2018, many Australians made resolutions at the beginning of the new year: getting into shape, reading more or learning a new language. It's still early, but I hope everyone's still committed to their resolutions. For those who didn't make one, one resolution that could be made this year is to take their health a little bit more seriously. There are a few simple things we can do to stay healthier and happier for longer. I encourage Australians—in particular, men—to go and see their doctors or their local pharmacists and have their blood pressure checked to prevent a number of the strokes which occur every year. Stroke is a disease which impacts one in six, and high blood pressure is the key factor that can be easily managed. Around four million Australians have high blood pressure and many of us don't even realise it. One way to know if it's a health issue is by going to your local doctor or your local pharmacist and simply having it checked. I also encourage men over the age of 50—or 40, if they've got family history of prostate cancer—to head to the doctor and get tested with the new

        testing. This blood test is used to measure the levels of a protein, called the prostate-specific antigen. It will show whether there might be a problem with the prostate gland. I encourage Australians to book their annual check-up with their local doctor or their local pharmacist to maintain their health. I wish everyone a happy and safe year.
