        I rise to table a petition organised by one of my constituents, Emeritus Professor Faith Trent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition relates to the ability of private health funds to pay the gap for outpatient radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients. Professor Trent is a faculty member of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        in my electorate, and a brief examination of her time there shows she has built up a history of strong contributions to the local community and is greatly respected by the university. Amongst her many achievements she has received an honorary doctorate from Flinders, been awarded the Mary MacKillop Medal and received a Order of Australia for her contributions to education and to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue is clearly one that she feels strongly about. For my part, I believe it is important to support those institutions and organisations that work to reduce the incidence and severity of cancer and provide support for those who are afflicted. That is why I have fought to secure the initial $10 million in funding for the new Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer. That centre is very close to my heart, since when it opened in 2012 it had been 13 years in the making. I had the privilege of seeing it go all the way from concept to completion during my time as the local member. Now, our community boasts a cancer facility unique on the national level, focusing on what happens with cancer before it occurs so that it can be detected and prevented. It is a place where research occurs in tandem with patient care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also believe that cancer patients need support as they go through the treatment process.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Council_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         The Cancer Council South Australia
        </a>
        is a wonderful charity that does so much for cancer research and supportive accommodation for cancer patients receiving treatment. That is why for the last few years I have been riding in the Santos Tour Down Under—

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        . The support and generosity of my local community has for this cause was particularly clear in 2012, when they propelled me up the fund-raising leader board to raise over $11,000 for this cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a related matter: in February I was very pleased to represent the Minister for Health and the Commonwealth government at the opening of the Northern Adelaide Cancer Centre. We were shown by Jacqui Adams, the Clinical Director of Cancer Services at Lyell McEwin and Country Health South Australia, an impressive new facility for patients in northern Adelaide and from the country who use that facility. I have great respect for Professor Trent's motivations in organising this petition, and at her request I present it on her behalf.
