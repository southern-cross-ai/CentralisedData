       <p>
        On the weekend, I am very, very proud to say I became the first male in Brisbane to become a member of the Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        . I wanted to put on record a few words about the role that the Country Women's Association plays in the Brisbane community and, indeed, around Queensland. Organised into 20 divisions and with over 250 branches across the state, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">
         QCWA
        </a>
        is the largest and most widespread women's organisation. The QCWA for many years has been about women, and now men too, coming together to make new friends, learn new skills and get involved as volunteers in their community. They are driven by the desire to help others and I admire their contribution to connecting people and building community spirit, in times when people in our community are feeling disconnected or alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the QCWA is very much a longstanding and venerable institution, being formed in 1922, I must report that on the weekend I witnessed a very vibrant and diverse group of people, many in their 20s and 30s, and it left me in no doubt that the organisation has never been stronger and has never been more relevant to our community, as it just keeps kicking goals all around Queensland. I would like to thank Brisbane City Night Branch President Ann Bullen, Jennifer Bray for organising the event,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_King" rel="nofollow">
         Christine King
        </a>
        , the QCWA Greater Brisbane Division President and all of the other strong and independent Queensland women I met on the weekend. Thank you for welcoming me into your organisation.
