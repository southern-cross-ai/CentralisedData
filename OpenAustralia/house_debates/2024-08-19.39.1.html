        I rise today to pay tribute to Coalcliff Surf Life Saving Club, who celebrate their 100-year anniversary this year. This centennial is a testament to the unwavering commitment of club members, who have watched over Coalcliff Beach for 100 years. Throughout countless hours of training, patrolling and community engagement, Coalcliff Surf Life Saving Club has become an integral part of the Illawarra, embodying the spirit of community service and leaving a legacy that truly reflects the club's enduring impact on our coastal community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It might be one of the Illawarra's smallest surf lifesaving clubs, but Coalcliff has proven mighty resilient over the past century. Since its inception in the early 1920s, the club has endured plenty of trials and tribulations. Disaster first struck in 1974, when the clubhouse and all historic records were destroyed by a wild storm. Tragedy struck again in early 2020, when all records, which had been stored at the club secretary's home for safekeeping, were lost to a fire. However, the town's surf lifesavers didn't let these setbacks diminish the club's spirit and kept a common goal of keeping the community safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you so much for all of the hours you give up to train, patrol and keep the club going. I was thrilled to join in your celebrations and present a certificate of recognition from Prime Minister Albanese. It was a fabulous event to be a part of. Congratulations to all of the life members that form part of this club.
