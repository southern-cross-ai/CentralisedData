        I want to take this opportunity to speak about one of the most common chronic childhood conditions, type 1 diabetes. It is a lifelong autoimmune disease that is usually diagnosed in childhood. I'm encouraged to speak in the Federation Chamber today by Lilly, whom I've had the privilege of meeting a few times both here in the House as part of the Kids in the House initiative and back home in the Riverland in

        .

        Lilly was four years old when she was diagnosed, and it's changed her world. I actually can't say anything more powerful than what Lilly's mum Chelsea wrote to me about recently: the need for a cure. In Chelsea's words:

       <p class="italic">
        As a mother watching her child suffer with this horrible disease, I find there is nothing more important I can do than to stand up and make the plea for help and support in finding a cure for the disease that has stolen my daughter's carefree life and replaced it with a life of carb counting, insulin injections and/or pumping and constant monitoring. I could go on forever about the way Type 1 has changed Lily's life, all of which break my heart.

        were to take this burden off her and take it on myself, I would do it in a heartbeat, but sadly this isn't an option. The only thing I can do for Lilly is to try and find a cure.

        The Australian Clinical Research Network is a collaborative initiative dedicated to positively impacting the lives of people with type 1 diabetes through accelerating clinical research for the cure, treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes. Current government funding for the Clinical Research Network ends in June next year. I stand with Chelsea and Lilly in wanting to see funding continue for this important initiative.
