        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement on 14 October last year when, declaring himself an economic conservative, he said:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That’s why I’ve always said and why I will always say, with pride, I’m an economic conservative. I believe in budget surpluses …
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister, when will the government deliver its first budget surplus?

           The honourable member asked a question about the credentials of an economic conservative. That is a badge I own with pride. It means this. It means adhering to the orthodoxy outlined by the member for Higgins: to support a budget surplus across the economic cycle. That is our orthodoxy. That, at least as articulated by the member for Higgins—the increasingly smirking member for Higgins—was his orthodoxy. We face at present the challenges of the global financial crisis and the challenges of the part of the cycle that we are in. That is the bottom line. I would also draw the attention of the member for Curtin to action taken most recently by the

             <p>
              Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Curtin spoke at length about the credentials of being an appropriate economic conservative. I am responding entirely within that framework. Therefore, I would draw her attention to the conservative government of Germany, the conservative government of Japan and the conservative government of the United States—running fiscal deficits of minus 4.6 per cent of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
               GDP
              </a>
              and minus 3.8 per cent of GDP. Germany, on the back of its most recent stimulus package, is running a deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP. I would also draw the attention of the honourable member for Curtin to the good old bank that the Leader of the Opposition used to work for. The former merchant bank
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" rel="nofollow">
               Goldman Sachs

              said as follows:

             <p class="italic">
              The combination of aggressive central bank easing and judicious fiscal stimulus will leave Australia better placed than its global peers in avoiding a deep and prolonged recession.

                  The challenge in implementing the government’s orthodoxy, which is to maintain a budget surplus across the economic cycle—something we said before the election campaign, during the election campaign, subsequent to the election campaign—applies to the immediate challenges we face in the current state of the economic cycle. That is something that the member for Higgins, in his more honest of private reflections, would agree with. Therefore, we have a strategy for dealing with the challenges presented by the global financial crisis. It is called economic stimulus to support families and jobs. I would reiterate what the Treasurer said just a moment ago: when it comes to the challenge of supporting families and jobs in the global financial crisis, at the end of the day the Liberal Party never put jobs first. They did not put jobs first with

                  . When it comes to the choices we face in dealing with the global financial crisis, they put jobs last as well. We stand by an economic stimulus strategy. It is the right thing for the nation, the right thing for the economy and the right thing for jobs.
