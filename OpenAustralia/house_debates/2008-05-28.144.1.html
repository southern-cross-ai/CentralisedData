        The youth of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Heads
        </a>
        had a commitment of funding from the previous coalition government of $100,000 during the 2007 election campaign for the construction of a skate park. The funding was committed under the Regional Partnerships program, conditional upon co-funding from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state government. The New South Wales state government did commit to the project but unfortunately did not sign a contract until 2008 due to the federal election that was called. In my view, that is not a reason to scrap the funding from the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The youth of the Tweed already feel cheated and let down by the political process. Indeed, Minister Elliottâ€™s politicisation of the issue further reinforces their sense of betrayal. Minister Elliott has said they should apply through the Better Regions program, but as that is only $176 million it really rules them out. There is no funding through that program. The money has been expended through programs that were promised during the election campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is estimated that up to 200 youths would use the park in Tweed Heads on a daily basis. The park would provide a safe environment for youth to enjoy skateboarding, as well as increase social participation and physical activity and give youth of the area the opportunity to do something that they certainly enjoy. It would also give them a place to go. It would get them off the streets. That social interaction is really important for the youth of that area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The youth themselves came together as a group and identified the need for a skate park. They put the funding application forward to the then federal government. I commend the youth of the Tweed for doing that. They have been let down, with no funding coming forth for that skate park. I think the minister has let those young people down and I say to her: please ensure that the youth of the Tweed can have this skate park so that they have somewhere to go and have somewhere they can socialise and come together as a young group. We all know that youth in our areas are often looking for places where they can come together in a safe environment. The skate bowl at Tweed Heads would have given them a great opportunity to do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think the youth of the area that I have spoken to certainly feel that they have been let down by the political process. We often have a bad name as politicians. We do like to give our youth and local communities what they need to ensure that there is safety in our communities and there are facilities that can be utilised by local communities. I say to Minister Elliott: please, for the youth of the area, do all you can to secure some funding so that the youth of Tweed Heads have their skate bowl park for the future. It is only $100,000; it is not a great deal of money.
