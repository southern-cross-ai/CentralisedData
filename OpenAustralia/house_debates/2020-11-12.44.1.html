        Local primary school schools across the Robertson electorate have now submitted their designs to our annual Christmas card competition. I look forward to seeing so many of the creative and colourful designs that are exhibited by our students every single year. In 2020, there were over 1,000 entries from 22 schools across the

        . The theme of hope is particularly pertinent given the recent challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the summer bushfires. I had a look at the designs, and every single one of them gave meaning to this idea in a really insightful and thoughtful way.

        First place this year goes to Winter from Empire Bay Public School, who perfectly captured the spirit of hope and a brighter future in her design featuring a ray of sunshine coming in from the clouds. Second place goes to Annalena from Woodport Public School, and third place to Sienna from Brisbania Public School. Highly commended places go to Maria from

        So congratulations to all of our place winners and also to each and every student who entered the competition. The time and the effort that you put in shone through in your amazing entries. I really look forward to meeting our award winners and their families at the annual presentation afternoon and also to seeing the Christmas gift-tag pack, which features every single student as a way of recognising and acknowledging their individual efforts in creating their own pictures of Christmas hope this year.
