        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        A key part of the government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan is to provide financial support to taxpayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures contained in this

         bill
        </a>
        do just that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill delivers the government’s tax bonus for working Australians, announced by the Prime Minister and Treasurer on 3 February 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan was introduced to assist the Australian people deal with the most significant economic crisis since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        and provide immediate economic stimulus to boost demand and support jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This measure, at a cost of $8.2 billion, provides financial support to around 8.7 million taxpayers and is one of five key $950 one-off payments for low- and middle-income households and individuals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is providing these cash payments to immediately support jobs and strengthen the Australian economy during a severe global recession.
       </p>
       <p>
        To immediately stimulate the economy in the shortest possible time, the five groups of one-off cash bonuses will be paid in March and April 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax bonus for working Australians will be paid to resident individual taxpayers who had taxable income of up to $100,000 and who paid income tax for the 2007-08 financial year, after taking into account any tax offsets and imputation credits.
       </p>
       <p>
        A payment of $950 will be paid to those who had a taxable income of up to and including $80,000 for the 2007-08 income year.
       </p>
       <p>
        A payment of $650 will be paid to those who had a taxable income exceeding $80,000 to $90,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        A payment of $300 will be paid to those who had a taxable income exceeding $90,000 up to and including $100,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eligibility for the payment will be determined by the Commissioner of Taxation, with all payments being made automatically by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The bonus will be available from April 2009 to Australian resident taxpayers who have already had their tax returns assessed.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will be the vast majority of eligible taxpayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxpayers who have not yet lodged their 2007-08 tax returns will have their bonus paid following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        ’s assessment of their returns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, taxpayers should lodge their 2007-08 tax return by 30 June 2009 to be eligible for the bonus payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
