       <p>
        One of the things which has been great in our budget is the significant amount of money contributed to the chaplaincy in schools programâ€”$243.8 million over four years. This program is very important to people in my electorate. We had a tragic accident on 18 February 2006 when a driver hit and killed six children. We saw the strong contribution of a chaplain at the Mildura secondary college as he helped to support children struggling with the tragedy. The chaplaincy in schools program will deliver $20,000 per year for up to 2,900 schools right across Australia and also $24,000 per year for remote schools. The advantage of helping young students as they grow and struggle to find their place in life and have someone to talk to is very valuable. This program has delivered really great things over the years. It has been supported by both sides of the House and it is really pleasing to see money dedicated to it in this budget. We believe our young people have a future. We believe our schools are very supportive. We also believe that a chaplain's role in school is instrumental in helping young adults become fulfilled, confident and great individuals.
