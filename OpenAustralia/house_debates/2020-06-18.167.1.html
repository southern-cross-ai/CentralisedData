        I'm really pleased to see that businesses are moving forward and adapting new ways as they change their business models as a result of COVID-19. Small businesses and manufacturing businesses of the Oxley electorate are the backbone of our economy, and as a proud supporter of local small businesses, and having grown up in one myself, I'm really pleased to address the parliament today to advise the House of a wonderful local manufacturing group in the Oxley electorate, Graphene Manufacturing Group. I recently visited their headquarters, based in Sumner in the Oxley electorate, along with my hardworking state member, the member for

        , a cleantech manufacturing company, commenced in 2016. With international experiences in oil and gas, the company founder set an ambitious target of manufacturing graphene from Queensland natural gasâ€”a bold attempt, as the original discovery of graphene came from slicing layers of graphite from mining. Graphene, discovered only in 2004, is the world's first two-dimensional material, made up of atomic layers of carbon. Graphene's discovery went on to win a

        GMG's main funding has predominantly come from private investors from Australia, Canada and Europe. Using predominantly overseas funding, they are based in Sumner Park. GMG is the self-proclaimed graphene gateway, and it's made an enormous impact across the academic and advanced manufacturing landscape in various countries around the world, especially in Australia. Whilst engaging with various world-leading international companies, GMG continues to financially support numerous Australian university research projects, including the

In total, GMG is collaborating with over 11 local and international universities.

        This is a world success story based in the south-west of Brisbane. I was so pleased to be able to sit down with the team based in Sumner to understand exactly what their company is providing: local jobs and clean new forms of energy to support a growing sector. I commend them to the House today.
