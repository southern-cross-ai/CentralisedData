        Research Station Modernisation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is proposing to redevelop the scientific research station and associated infrastructure on Macquarie Island, which has operated continually since establishment in 1948. The redevelopment also includes the renewal of field huts, which are dispersed across Macquarie Island, and the decommissioning and removal of redundant assets. The project will address hazards to the use and operation of the research station associated with the poor conditions of the existing assets, address high-risk issues associated with the siting of facilities, and reduce ongoing operating costs by rationalising and consolidating similar functions. The estimated cost of the works is $59.8 million, excluding

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 23 June 2021. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2022 with an expected completion date of mid-2028.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry, and I commend the motion to the House.

        , Parramatta fit-out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Home Affairs is proposing fit-out works as part of its consolidation of leased office space in Sydney. Home Affairs currently occupies three buildings in Sydney—two in the central business district and one in Parramatta. The leases are due to expire in 2022 and 2023 with no options to extend. Under the Home Affairs Sydney precinct strategy, the consolidation of these three sites into 101 George Street, Parramatta will provide operational efficiency, will provide flexibility to allow for changing and future business requirements and will reduce overall property operating costs. The estimated cost of the works is $25.2 million excluding GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 12 May 2021. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in November 2021 and are scheduled to be completed in mid-2022.
