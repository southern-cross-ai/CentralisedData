        I will deliver an abridged version of my address, understanding that it would be most unwise to seek an extension of time beyond the commencement of the normal adjournment debate because my proposal for such an extension would go down in a screaming heap, opposed by both coalition members and my colleagues here on the government side. So I will do the very best I can in the more limited time that I have.

        I observe that the member for Dunkley, the shadow small business minister, has displayed himself as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Clouseau" rel="nofollow">
         Inspector Clouseau
        </a>
        of Australian politics. He came to the dispatch box with his magnifying glass. He could see all these conspiracies happening around him. He thought if he could dig a little further he might find under all of the detail what we were really up to with the resource super profits tax. In so doing, the member for Dunkley raised to record heights the scare campaign that has been engaged in by the coalition in relation to the resource super profits tax. Let this day be marked as the day that the coalition has said that the kiddies will not be able to get their sand in their play pits as a result of the resource super profits tax. That is what he came in here and said, as a serious point. I notice the shadow minister opposite, the member for Casey, shaking his head. I agree with him. He should shake his head at this stupid scare campaign of the member for Dunkley.

             This is the point I was making: the shadow ministerâ€™s colleague walked into this chamber and said the kiddies will not be able to get any sand in their sandpits, in their playpits, as a result of the resource super profits tax. He might shake his head again at this one because the shadow minister for small business walked into this chamber and said the kiddies will not get their talcum powder because of the resource super profits tax. This is the absurdity of the scare campaign that has been launched by the coalition in relation to the resource super profits tax.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a tax reform package and at no time during the contribution of the shadow small business minister did he mention the small business tax breaks. Did he mention the fact that every one of the 2.4 million small businesses in this country would receive a capacity to write off instantly the value of any eligible asset up to the value of $5,000, which would provide a welcome cash flow boost and an incentive to invest in productive assets? All 2.4 million businesses would get that. That would be a great thing for small businesses; but who is opposing that?
            </p>
            <p>
             The shadow small business minister and the coalition parties, especially the Liberal Party, say that they are the party of small business. They think and talk back to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
              Sir Robert Menzies
             </a>
             talking about the forgotten people and how the newly formed Liberal Party would represent the forgotten people, the shopkeepers and the small business owners of Australia. And what do they do? They cut their throats. They came into this chamber and said that they are going to oppose legislation that would provide a tax break for every one of those 2.4 million small businesses in Australiaâ€”that is, sole traders, partnerships and companies.

                  If he was committed to the debate he would have stayed in the chamber. He would have stayed in the chamber and the member for Bowman would have been in the chamber when we got onto the bayside. The member for Bonner is here with us today, every day, backing small business and her neighbour, the member for Bowman, cannot even last the distance. He had to go out for a break and then I think he came back inâ€”I am not sure; he was probably at the party pies at the airportâ€”because he cannot stay the distance. He will not stick up for small business.

                   Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: in terms of the conduct of the debate, even by the ministerâ€™s pathetically low standards, this is juvenile. We are talking about the conduct of the debate and your conduct in the chair.

They are the forgotten people all right.

                                have forgotten the small business people, the shopkeepers and small business owners of this country because they want to deny them a tax break. They do not believe in small business. They voted against the stimulus package, they completely opposed the stimulus package, they are against our tradies, they are against the shopkeepers and they are against all the small businesses in this country.

                                We had the shadow minister for small business daring me to talk about paid parental leave. I will talk about it because the Leader of the Opposition has come up with a great big new tax on everything you buyâ€”that is, a 1.7 per cent increase in the company tax rate for larger businesses which we passed on to every small business in the country, to the 19,242 small businesses in this countryâ€”when the member ought to be sticking up for small business. But he is sticking it up small business because he wants to apply the flow-on from that paid parental leave great big new tax on everything you buy to the 19,242 small businesses in this country. He wants to deny every small business company in his electorate a head-start reduction in the company tax rate. All he wants to do is increase taxes on small business.

                                They have the temerity to come in here and say, â€˜We are supporting small business.â€™ All you are doing is supporting an increase in taxation on small business. As I said in question time, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. What happened to the once great Liberal Party that used to stick up for small business and now have abandoned them in their time of need? You are a complete disgrace to this House and a complete disgrace to the traditions of the Liberal Party. It proves yet again that the Rudd Labor government is the best friend that small business has ever had and will be the only friend that small business will ever have if you wantonly abandon the small business community of this country in their hour of need during the global financial recession. Now, when they want a bit of support during the recovery, you are prepared to abandon them yet again. You are a complete disgrace and should be ashamed of yourselves.
