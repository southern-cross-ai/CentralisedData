       <p>
        The government's budget has failed in many ways, but it has particularly failed the residents of my electorate of Gorton when it comes to infrastructure funding. The western suburbs of Melbourne, as this place knows, is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. With housing, on average, less exorbitant than other parts of Melbourne, my electorate is home to many young families who are looking to have a decent life. Often they are there because they are part of the community but also because they are priced out of other areas. People have been flocking to this area. There are good schools and a good sense of community. There is relatively close access to the CBD and to the airport. It really is growing exponentially. Eleven new suburbs have recently been announced in my electorate within the city of Melton alone. In fact, the eventual population in the next 10 years of the city of Melton is projected to be in excess of 400,000â€”more than Canberra. With this extraordinary and, I would say, fantastic increase in population comes a strain on our resources and our existing infrastructure. Our roads are becoming more congested and more unsafe every day, yet the substantial federal funding required for upgrades to the major roads has not been forthcoming by this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite lobbying from the local community and councils, no funds were made available for an upgrade to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Western Highway
        </a>
        between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Springs
        </a>
        and Melton. This is not some minor backstreet; the Western Highway is the major road corridor between Melbourne and Adelaide. It is the second-busiest national highway in Australia in terms of freight movement. It is used not just for the residents of my electorate to access education, employment, training and leisure but for major freight transport both interstate and regionally. The required upgrade to the Western Highway, including a new interchange to serve the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melton_West" rel="nofollow">
         Melton West
        </a>
        area is genuinely needed, to serve not just the community but more than 50,000 vehicles that travel in each direction every day. Unfortunately, the government is ignoring this need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melton_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Melton Highway
        </a>
        between Hillside and Melton is another project that must be funded. As more families move to the suburbs along that major road, the highway is becoming increasingly busy and dangerous. Too many fatalities have already occurred on that stretch of road. The much-needed duplication will ease this congestion, but a commitment to provide funds is needed for this to happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, the Calder Park Drive overpass is a desperately needed infrastructure upgrade that residents in my electorate have been calling out for for years. When Labor was last in government we widened the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ring_Road" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and built the

        </a>
        overpass. We desperately need the Calder Park Drive overpass. No commitment has been made by this government.

          Thank you, member for Bendigo. Although this is not a line item in the budget, I understand planning money has been allocated for this project, but no commitment has been given. Whilst this is a positive first step, we need a commitment that this project will proceed and the appropriate funds allocated. As I said, it was the federal Labor government that secured significant infrastructure projects for the Gorton electorate, including funding for $50 million for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
           Calder Freeway
          </a>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Road" rel="nofollow">
           Kings Road
          </a>
          interchange project. The Calder Park Drive overpass is an important continuation of the previous Labor upgrades which the Turnbull government must commit to.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor recognises that Melbourne's western suburbs are experiencing significant growth, and Gorton remains one of the fastest-growing electorates in the country. That is why we believe in the importance of investing in road infrastructure to keep pace with population growth. This government, I say, has been failing the residents of Gorton by refusing to commit to funding the roads we need. This is a crucial issue. I have many constituents concerned that not enough investment is occurring in our region and in our electorate. Indeed, Victorians have been robbed of infrastructure spending as a result of the federal budget.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
           The Liberals
          </a>
          do not invest in the west of Melbourne. It is about time that they looked at the growth in this area and realised that it is critical that they start investing in the west and start making sure that constituents of my electorate are given every opportunity to have good roads, uncongested roads, safer roads and better infrastructure for leisure and for work to ensure that this remarkable area of Melbourne is looked after like every other part of Melbourne.
