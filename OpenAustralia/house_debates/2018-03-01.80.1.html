        My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. Will the minister update the House on the importance of creating a tax setting which helps grow the economy and reduces the tax burden on hardworking Australians? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches which pose a threat to Australian small businesses and families alike, including in my electorate of Corangamite?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for her question and I applaud her for her tireless advocacy on behalf of her constituents—in particular, the more than 17,000 small businesses that have benefited from our government's small business and medium sized enterprise tax cuts. The government has in fact put in place, and worked very hard to put in place, the right settings to drive economic growth and boost jobs. We've cut taxes for small and medium sized enterprises, and we have seen the creation of 1,100 jobs every day to ensure that more and more Australians have the opportunity to work, to invest and to grow our economy. We know Australia does need to remain competitive. We have to do it with our tax system if we are to drive jobs and growth and remain competitive in a globalised marketplace. Our government will continue to fight for our enterprise tax plan that will deliver the jobs, the increased wages and the economic expansion that we require.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition claims that he supports small business tax cuts, but he would, in fact, raise taxes for small businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $50 million. The Leader of the Opposition has a problem with this thing called authenticity. He claims to be a big supporter of women, yet this morning we see reports that

He is apparently an ecowarrior in inner-city Melbourne but the miners' mate when he is in

              The level of interjections was too loud, as members know. The member for Perth had been warned. He was one of the louder interjectors. He can leave under standing order 94(a). It's pretty simple to follow the sequence here, but it's lost on some people.

                 NDIS
                </a>
                is fully funded. That's what this government is going to do. This is what the shadow Treasurer said when the former government increased the Medicare levy as a way of part funding the NDIS:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                We took it to the

                 Productivity Commission
                </a>
                . They gave a report on how it should be done. We did have to … pay for it, increase the Medicare levy. That's something that was very controversial when we did it but I think the right thing to do because all Australians would recognise that as a decent, compassionate nation, it is the right thing to do now. It is overdue.
               </p>
               <p>
                If it was the right thing to do then, then it's the right thing to do now.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is the shadow Treasurer who has turned his back on everything he used to believe. He has completely wilted in the face of the pressure from the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Left" rel="nofollow">
                 Labor Left
                </a>
                . His own leader has forced him to turn his back on his previous positions. If he can't stand up to the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, what good is he? This is a man who used to believe something. He has been completely brought to the position of recanting humiliation as the shadow Treasurer. That's why he can't be trusted with the nation's finances. Whatever he used to believe doesn't matter, because he hasn't got the ticker to stand up to this Leader of the Opposition, that deputy leader and whatever other pretender on that side there is to the leadership of the Labor Party. He cannot be trusted to hold a position and hold to his convictions and his beliefs on the economy.
