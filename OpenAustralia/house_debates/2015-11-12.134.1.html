        T20 Blast cricket finals recently in Sydney. The school was invited to attend after Cricket New South Wales MILO scouts witnessed the talent on offer at the local T20 competition. All of the students that participated represented the school with honour and pride throughout the event.

        The MILO T20 Blast is a modified version of cricket for kids that do not get the opportunity to play a lot of cricket. Bing Williams and Rico Avery were fantastic leaders on the day, with Rico receiving two votes for the best and fairest for game 2. The day was full of highlights for the children, none more so than Tamia Hickling being the only player during the matches to hit a MILO sponsor sign; therefore winning a prize. During each game there are coaching stations set up to encourage the kids to learn new skills. Michael Zervos performed well in the high-catch event. Students that attended the event were Louise Flockhart, Abby Martin, Tamia Hickling, Haylee White, Michael Zervos,Shaniqwah Tighe, Bing Williams and Rico Avery. I also thank the support staff, Eloise James and Carmel McGrady, who looked after the students.

        Reaching a century, reaching 100 years of age, is a milestone not many people get to celebrate, but this week Elsie Hale did just that. There is nothing wrong with the health of this centenarian, who reached her 100th birthday on Monday, citing the occasional sore foot as her only ailment and perhaps a nightly nip of brandy as the secret of her good health. 'My foot is probably just some arthritis; otherwise, I have no sickness,' the happy-go-lucky resident at Dougherty Villa said. 'Even my doctor said there is nothing wrong with me. He said he doesn't know what I'm going to die from,' she laughed.

        Elsie began her long life in Southgate, where she was delivered by the local bush nurse. Elsie attended the Upper Copmanhurst Public School, leaving at age 14. She then went on to work at the Davies General Store at Copmanhurst as a housekeeper and cook for the family before heading to Ramornie Station. Elsie remained in that position until she was married at age 26 to George Waghorn. The couple were married in November 1941 at

        in Bent Street, South Grafton. The couple had three children, Fay, Pam and Ivy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elsie then in the fifties met

         Tom Hale
        </a>
        . She married Tom and had three more children, Gayle, Garry and Ann, living in various locations around the North Coast before settling in Bonalbo, where they lived for the next 60 years. There, Elsie worked at the local hospital as a cook for seven years until she retired from paid work at around age 65.
