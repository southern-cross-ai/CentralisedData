       <p>
        One of the most important tasks in our country is that performed by our dads. The research says one of the biggest predictors of individual success in life is the presence of good fathering. Of course mothers play a vital role in the lives of their children, but when we see societal issues emerge it can often be traced back to the lack of a strong fatherly influence. We can't all be lucky enough to have a father in our lives but male role models have a huge influence in raising well-adjusted and responsible individuals who can contribute to making our society stronger. Targeted interventions aimed at promoting positive parenting behaviours and fathers' engagements are working in my community, and I want to see more of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the parliament last met I hosted the shadow assistant minister for social services and prevention of family violence, the member for Cowper, in the Redlands to listen to local organisations working in this space. Men and Co Capalaba are providing services to help struggling men reflect upon their lives and challenges and become the best man they can be in every area of their lives. The local leaders of The Fathering Project in the Redlands are also positively impacting fathering behaviours and fathers' engagements with children through evidence rich programs and resources that equip and support fathers, families, schools and employers in my city.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all the different groups working across the Redlands to help our dads be the best they can be for themselves, their children and Australia's future.
