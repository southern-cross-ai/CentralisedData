        I rise to talk about some very important visitors that we've had down to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        this week. First I had one of the schools from my area, Holsworthy Public School. It was great to meet the year 5 and year 6 students. They were a credit to their school, to their parents and to our overall community. They had some very interesting questions. Most important, I think, was, 'How old are you, Jenny?' I did appreciate their other questions, to understand the issues that are important to them.

       <p>
        It's on Wikipedia, so I had to be honest!

        I was also very pleased to meet with some constituents yesterday who make the trip down to Canberra on a regular basis: Jack Smythe; his mum, Carol; and Jack's partner, Danielle, who live in the beautiful suburb of Engadine, within the electorate of Hughes. Jack has battled with cystic fibrosis throughout his life. He expressed to me the gratitude he had to the former Morrison government that he is now able to access his medication, called Trikafta, on the PBS. It would previously have been an expense for him of up to $250,000 a year. To the Holsworthy Public School students and the Smythe family: thank you for coming down to Canberra.
