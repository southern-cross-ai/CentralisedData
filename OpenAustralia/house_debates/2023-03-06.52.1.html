        I inform the House of two recent electorate visits by shadow ministers and thank them for meeting with my constituents. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Farrer, visited Moore in her capacity as the shadow minister for small and family business and the shadow minister for industry, skills and training. She addressed the Joondalup Business Association and participated in a Q&amp;A forum on local issues. From there, we visited Carpet Choices, where we heard from proprietor

        about the challenges in training apprentices required to install floor coverings. The next stop was the College of Electrical Training in Joondalup for a briefing on the development of an innovation centre to deliver courses of study relevant to apprentices of the future, including in advanced battery technology, hydrogen fuel cells, robotics and innovation.

        Last week, the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister for early childhood education and shadow minister for youth, visited the Joondalup campus of Alta-1 college, where she witnessed firsthand the great work being done to support youth with unique learning needs to complete their secondary education, enabling them to progress onto vocational education and the workforce. This was followed by a forum in my office where leading early childhood educators raised their concerns about the challenge of recruiting qualified staff to work in their centres and the need to address this issue.
