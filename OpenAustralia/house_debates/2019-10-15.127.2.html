        My electorate of Greenway is home to many schools giving local students the very best start in life. All of us in this place understand the transformative power of education. It's something I mentioned in my first speech. We witness it every time we're invited to join a school community. I want to take this opportunity to mention a few schools in my electorate, including Girraween Public School and Parklea Public School. Both of these fine Greenway schools recently celebrated the centenary of their formation. They have become most respected institutions in our local community.

        Visiting Girraween Public School was like stepping back in time. The historical displays were a delightful reminder of where we have come from as a community and what we've achieved together. I was particularly impressed by the school's

        garden, a demonstration of what Greenway locals would have kept in their own gardens during this period. I want to make special mention of the participation of the Wentworthville Tamil Study Centre in these celebrations. It's had a long association with Girraween Public School, which is in the area of a high Tamil-speaking cohort, and there's been a great partnership between the school and the Tamil study centre for many years. Congratulations to principal Mr Glenn Walker and the entire Girraween executive and all the students, parents and caregivers on their efforts. The centenary was a tremendous success.

        Parklea Public School's Rides Night was an exciting celebration of their centenary. I had the pleasure of taking my daughters, Octavia and Aurelia, who very much enjoyed the festive atmosphere and the hospitality provided. It was wonderful to join with such a vibrant community to celebrate their history and, of course, look to what can be achieved in the future. Congratulations to principal Mr Ross Sutherland, the Parklea executive and the centenary organising committee for their hard work, and particularly to all the volunteers who ran such a great evening.

        on the celebration of their 60th and 25th anniversaries respectively. Your anniversary dinners were an absolute pleasure to attend. Thank you so much for your generous hospitality in hosting me. Having visited both schools on a great number of occasions, it was fantastic to join with staff, students, former staff and students, and parents to celebrate this milestone. Congratulations to the Seven Hills High School principal Mr Greg Johnston and Hambledon Public School principal Ms Judy McEwen for all of your efforts. On behalf of this place, I'd like to extend my congratulations to the staff, students and parents of Girraween, Parklea and Hambledon public schools and Seven Hills High School on all their achievements. Your commitment to excellence, promotion of first-class public education and the celebration of our diversity in the Greenway community makes our local area a fantastic place to live and educate our children.
