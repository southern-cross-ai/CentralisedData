        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed redevelopment will:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         replace residential accommodation blocks, administration and academic office accommodation and senior common room facilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         refurbish the existing library, teaching, dining areas and specific heritage buildings;
        </li>
        <li>
         construct soft and hard landscaping to various areas of the site, including consolidation of surface car parking;
        </li>
        <li>
         remove existing barrack style accommodation buildings and miscellaneous stores buildings; and
        </li>
        <li>
         undertake landscaping works to improve the environment for both human and native fauna occupants of the site.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works should proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Federal Police accepts and will implement those recommendations.

        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence late this year with a construction period of approximately 26 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        <i>
         Public Works Committee Act 1969

        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Facilities Project, Enoggera, Qld.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes a facilities project to support the introduction of the new tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capability and the establishment of the 20th Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiment at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Enoggera, Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will involve the refurbishment of a number of existing facilities at Gallipoli Barracks, with the construction of some new purpose-built facilities to support the tactical unmanned aerial vehicles specialised maintenance and training requirements. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $17.45 million.
