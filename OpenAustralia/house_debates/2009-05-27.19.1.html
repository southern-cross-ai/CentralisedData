        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The

         Social Security Legislation Amendment (Improved Support for Carers) (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2009
        </a>
        provides part of the government’s response to the report of the Carer Payment (child) Review Taskforce, and gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers from 1 July 2009. It has received wide-ranging support and been passed by the House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4129" rel="nofollow">
         bill
        </a>
        being introduced today makes amendments as a consequence of the measures contained in the improved support for carers bill. That bill makes substantive changes to the qualification provisions for carer payment paid in respect of a child.
       </p>
       <p>
        This companion bill makes minor amendments of a consequential and transitional nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments include removal of references in the social security law that, from 1 July 2009, will be redundant and replaces those references with new terms and references necessary for the proper administration of the changes introduced in the improved support for carers bill. Amendments made by this bill will provide that carers who qualify for carer payment under the new qualification provisions will be able to take advantage of the 63 days (or the pro rata equivalent for carers qualified on a short-term or episodic basis) on which carers can temporarily cease to provide constant care and remain qualified for carer payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides that nominated visa holders who cannot qualify for carer payment as they do not meet the residence requirement can be granted an exemption from the activity test in relation to special benefit if they are providing care to a child or children who meet the criteria contained in the new qualification provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also amends the provisions that relate to the nomination of the principal beneficiary of a special disability trust, under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        1991 or the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, to reflect the changes made by the introduction of the improved qualification criteria for carer payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, the bill provides for backdating of carer payment for people who apply for carer payment under one of the new qualification provisions. A person who makes an application before 1 October 2009 will be able to have their carer payment backdated until 1 July 2009 or to the date they became qualified for carer payment. The earliest they can become qualified is the date of implementation of the new qualification provision, which is 1 July 2009. I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>

        Debate (on motion by
