       <p class="italic">
        Is the Minister aware that the communities in the electoral divisions of Wills and Calwell are yet to absorb the full effects of the hollowing out of the local manufacturing base, as a result of the Government's decision to abandon manufacturing, particularly through the closure of Ford Australia's manufacturing plant in Broadmeadows.

         The Minister for Employment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The premise of the question by the Member for Wills is false.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Members for Willis and Calwell supported the Carbon Tax and Labor's economic policies that led to a number of companies in Australia finding that it was no longer economically viable and competitive to do business in Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Furthermore, in 2012 the previous government announced a new subsidy to Holden, which it claimed would 'guarantee' its operations until 2022. This 'guarantee', of course, proved to be illusory. I also note the comments by senior

         's court action to prevent its employees from even considering changes to its enterprise agreement that would have enabled the company's Melbourne operations to become more efficient and competitive, without impacting on pay and conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I also note recent media reports on 1 December 2014 on the previous Government's automotive "assistance" policies, which stated that:
