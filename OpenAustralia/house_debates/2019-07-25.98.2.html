        That the House calls on the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to immediately make a statement to the House for a period not exceeding 20 minutes explaining:

       <p class="italic">
        (1) why he met with Department of the Environment and Energy officials and the office of the then Minister for the Environment and Energy, and now Treasurer, in March 2017 to discuss the listing of a critically endangered grasslands while the department was investigating the alleged poisoning of the same grasslands on land he part-owned;
       </p>

        (3) why, following the meeting, the office of the then Minister for Environment and Energy asked for advice on whether he could vary the relevant listing without the advice of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, whether he could act against the Committee's advice and whether he could keep the reasons for the variation secret;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) why, despite stating that his interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd was declared in accordance with the rules, he has failed to list his indirect interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd on his Member's Statement of Registrable Interests;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) what declarations, if any, the Minister has made to the Department of the Environment and Energy, the office of the then Minister for the Environment and Energy and the Prime Minister about his interest in the land subject to a compliance investigation by the Department of the Environment and Energy; and
