        (â€”) (): I would like to congratulate Janice Currie-Henderson for a lifetime achievement award, which was presented at this year's Brigid Awards gala dinner in Sydney for the Irish community. Janice has made a huge contribution to Irish dancing in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and in Australia, benefitting both the cultural and community life of Australians. I have known her since I was a child, growing up in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Beverly Hills
        </a>
        . She was one of the founding members of the Australian Irish Dancing Association, the association that is celebrating their 50-year anniversary this year. Janice has been teaching for over 57 years and has produced 20 Australian champions and numerous national team champions in various categories. Her students have performed for Australian prime ministers and also on the world stage, performing in leading productions such as
        <i>
         Riverdance
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Gaelforce Dance
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         To Dance on the Moon

        <i>
         .
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is no surprise. Janice started Irish dancing when she was four, and during her own dancing career she was a national champion and a New South Wales champion on many occasions. Janice has touched the lives of thousands of dance students across Sydney, particularly in the suburbs of Mascot, Kensington, Waterloo, Merrylands, Kingsgrove, Earlwood Beverly Hills,
