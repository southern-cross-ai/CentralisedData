        does in communities right across Australia, including in Tasmania. The foundation's goal is that every family in Australia experiencing breast cancer has access to a breast care nurse, no matter where they live or their financial situation. This year, they have hit their maiden 'ton' and have secured funding for their 100th McGrath breast care nurse.

        At the St Brendan-Shaw Pink Stumps Day, pairs of players went in to bat for an innings each on the school's oval, facing six balls in a fast-moving match on Friday, 14 March. Although many thought their sporting days had passed, the teachers won the match. They did admit, however, that the students were more agile and, I would say, recovered a little easier. The students dressed in pink, with pink hair and zinc on their faces, donated gold coins and raised $736 for this worthy cause. The priority of the day was to raise awareness among the school community about breast cancer and also to strengthen the St Brendan-Shaw school community. The St Brendan-Shaw cricket event was part of the Jane McGrath's Pink Stumps Day program, which is running from 22 February through to the end of May. This is a fantastic initiative and I encourage other schools and cricket clubs in my electorate to participate.
