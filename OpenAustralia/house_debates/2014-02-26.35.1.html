        in my electorate of Deakin. On 18 February, I was honoured to attend a whole college assembly to celebrate the 60th anniversary of classes at Ringwood Secondary College. In my speech to the students at that assembly, I reminded them that the outstanding reputation of the college had been built over a period of time through the hard work and dedication of countless parents, teachers and students and that all current students at Ringwood Second College had an obligation to continue that outstanding tradition by diligently applying themselves to their learning and representing the college to the best of their ability. On behalf of the government, I also thanked all of the teachers and school leaders, most particularly their outstanding principal

        On a personal level, it was also special for me to attend these celebrations as both my mother and uncle attended Ringwood Secondary College. Once again, I congratulate the Ringwood Secondary College community on the occasion of their 60th anniversary and look forward to participating in further anniversary events throughout the year.
