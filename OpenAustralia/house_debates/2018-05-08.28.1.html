        Back in 1951, 67 years ago, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_Line_of_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Bells Line of Road
        </a>
        corridor was reserved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government. Now, I would never advocate for us going back 67 years in history, because we did some pretty awful things back then, but I would advocate for the many landholders, families and businesses 67 years ago who set up along that stretch of road and made their homes with the idea that the corridor was reserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, with the stroke of a pen, the New South Wales Liberal government have come along and decided to realign that corridor. This has put 500 people's homes, businesses and lives up in absolute turmoil. The New South Wales state government sent Network Ten,

        </a>
        and a couple of people from the department to inform these families that their homes were going to be compulsorily acquired so that they could move this section of road to accommodate a 24-hour airport down the road at

        â€”another backflip from this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office has received over 1,000 submissions. I have attended community rallies of 500 to 600 people during the day, when they should be at work. I have had numerous families come into my office, including children, who are upset about the future of their homes. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to everybody involved with the Castlereagh, Cranebrook and Llandilo action group, including the leaders of that group, Mary Vella, Patrick Serobian, Cathy Galea,

        and everybody at Raygal nursery, for their continued advocacy for our community.
