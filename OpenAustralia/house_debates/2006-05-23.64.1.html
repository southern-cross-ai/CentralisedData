        share trading. He referred to the fact that the sale took place just prior to the release of the Volcker report, which was highly critical of AWB. In this story, the member for Gwydir denied any advance knowledge of the contents of the Volcker report and said that he had always intended to sell the shares when the price hit $5. This claim contradicted his earlier statement that, on the basis of advice from his accountant, he sold his shares in order to diversify his rural investments. But it gets worse. His claim that he intended to sell the AWB shares as soon as they reached $5—

          I am listening closely to the member for Wills and he is going very close to overstepping the mark. He would be well aware that the proper forms of the House are that, if he wishes to pursue this much further, he should use a substantive motion. I will allow the member for Wills to continue but I would ask him to temper his remarks.

The share price hit that point on another 30 occasions between 10 March 2004 and 5 October 2005. But this self-declared share price was ignored and the stock was held on to.
