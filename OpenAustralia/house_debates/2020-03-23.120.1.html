       <p>
        On a matter involving the whips: a large number of members who have been paired have been raising that they wanted their names recorded in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        as pairs, as an indication that they wanted to be here. I think the whips had a fair bit of trouble stopping some members from being here and getting down to the required numbers.

        <p>
         That's right; the reverse of what we normally expect whips to do. Members don't all need to stay for it, but, so that it gets recorded in
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         , I wonder whether on indulgence you could allow the government whip and then the opposition whip to read the names of the pairs into
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         , so that in good faith we've made that point clear to them.

          I think that's a good course of action. I'll grant indulgence, first of all, to the Chief Government Whip.
