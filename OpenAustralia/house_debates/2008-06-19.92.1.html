       <p>
        At the outset, I would like to commend the honourable member for Moreton on his contribution. I think it is wonderful that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness
        </a>
        Pope Benedict XVI is visiting Australia. It would be tremendous if the government would have a special Friday sitting of the parliament whereby His Holiness could be present and members of the Australian parliament would be able to recognise this very important figure. I am sure the government would have no quarrel from the opposition were such a Friday sitting to be instituted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having said that, I do intend today to talk about a very important industry to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        and to Australia generally, and that is the prawn fishing industry, which currently fears it may be forced to close down by Christmas as a result of several factors, the main ones being the rising cost of fuel and competition from cheaper imported products.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total import of fish products, including prawns, into Australia topped $1 billion for the first time in 2005-06. Crustacean imports, consisting mainly of prawns, made up $256 million of that. Thailand and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        dominate the import market for edible fisheries product, but increasingly there has been importation from China and other parts of Asia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We believe that the Australian product is the very best product. But, because of the difference in price between the Australian product and the imported product, increasing numbers of Australians are buying the imported product, causing a situation where our local industry is threatened. It is no surprise, of course, with the rising price of groceries in Australia that consumers are indeed endeavouring to save money in any way they can, even if that means buying inferior prawns or other seafood products.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pressures on the local industry are a major concern for prawn fisheries in my electorate on the Sunshine Coast. Many families depend on the prawning industry. They have been feeling the pressure for some time, and now the increasing price of fuel, which is getting to astronomical heights and has experienced what can only be described as ridiculous price hikes in recent times, has added to what could be a final nail in the coffin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other issues the industry says it has been facing over years are the destruction of natural waterways that are an important link in the breeding chain of prawns; the closure of parts of the fisheries north of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        ; and the relocation of vessels affected by the closure to other ports, thereby increasing demand on existing fisheries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I spoke to Sunshine Coast representatives of the industry. They advised me that they are concerned about losing their homes and their livelihoods, and there have even been thoughts of suicide. The government needs to look at the situation of the prawn industry. I ask that the government look with favour on the plight of these Australians who make such a wonderful contribution to our economy.
