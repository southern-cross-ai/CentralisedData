        Today I acknowledge the passing of a Labor doyenne in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , Bob Hetherington, who died in peace 10 days ago at the grand old age of 92. Bob represented Labor in the legislative council for 12 years from 1977. At the time of his preselection, Bob had been a lecturer in politics in Western Australia for 10 years. He was a part of a group of energetic recruits into a modernising Western Australian Labor parliamentary team and his preselection was considered to be a great coup for Labor. I recall the excitement his preselection generated with my friends who had been his students. He had been such a powerful and inspiring educator of politics. He was appointed deputy leader of the opposition the year he entered the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob brought life experience as well as intellect to his roles in academia and politics. At 18, Bob enlisted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIF" rel="nofollow">
         AIF
        </a>
        and served in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        and Morotai. He rose to the rank of Sergeant. He grasped the opportunity for returned servicemen to gain a university education and went on to have a distinguished academic career. Bob was well known for his advocacy for mental health and for the enlightened treatment of schizophrenia. Bob remained a Labor supporter, committed to all that was decent in public policy until his last days.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Bob's wife, Pen, his children and grandchildren, our deepest sympathy. Bob was truly a gentleman and a scholar and I know I will miss him.
