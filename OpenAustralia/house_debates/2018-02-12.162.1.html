        I start by congratulating Australia's fabulous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        team, which triumphed in the rubber against Ukraine on the weekend in Canberra, particularly Queenslander Ash Barty, birthday girl

        . What a spectacular summer of tennis we have all experienced! Again this year, Australians—indeed, the world—have been in awe of the sportsmanship and competitiveness of our elite tennis players.
       </p>
       <p>
        Closer to my sporting electorate of Ryan, a full house of 100,000 spectators enjoyed the sights and sounds of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_International" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane International
        </a>
        at the beginning of January. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI" rel="nofollow">
         BI
        </a>
        was another resounding success. Thanks must go to all those who worked behind the scenes as well as all the ballkids—without them those tournaments just would not function. During the Brisbane International, I had the opportunity to join a site tour of the Queensland Tennis Centre's facilities with members of the Players with an Intellectual Disability state tennis training squad. These amazing young men and women continue to achieve new goals. In particular, I make special mention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Graham" rel="nofollow">

        of Ipswich, currently world number 1 and recipient of the

        award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tennis is a sport of inclusion and does not discriminate. This was especially demonstrated during the record turnout for the come-and-try event for local would-be wheelchair tennis players. I thank all those players, coaches and carers who gave up their time to make the day so special, including our own patron for the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Alcott" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This was followed by an exhibition match on centre court which included a running commentary by Dylan. How good was that!
       </p>
       <p>
        In Queensland, there are more than 45,000 registered tennis club members and 86,000

        and Fitbit Cardio Tennis participants. The ANZ Tennis Hot Shots program has continued to attract more children to this ageless sport. The program introduces primary school children to tennis, using modified rules and equipment. Tennis Hot Shots encourages fitness, socialising and all-round entertainment, and I could not think of a better sport for this than tennis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those participating in the current cohort of Hot Shots may very well be the next

        . It is wonderful to see the growing profile of tennis throughout Queensland. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Tennis Queensland, including President, Mark Bloomfield,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Handley" rel="nofollow">

        , Elia Hill and their hardworking teams for the success of this major event. The following week, many of them backed up for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Open
        </a>
        , and less than two weeks later everyone was back in Brisbane for the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        tie of the year against Germany.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased that the federal government was able to support a three-day Davis Cup inclusive workshop, forum and wonderful workshops for multicultural and Indigenous children as well. No matter where you are in the world or what language you speak, pick up a tennis racket and you are bound to meet friends who share your common bond.
