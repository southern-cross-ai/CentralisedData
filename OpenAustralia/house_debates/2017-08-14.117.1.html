       <p>
        Tonight, I'm thinking about my lifelong friends—Tom and James, Kate and Julie, Zac and Simon, and all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTI
        </a>
        sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, carers, friends, workmates and loved ones across Australia. I'm thinking about how they feel in the face of this government's open disrespect for their relationships, for their legal rights, and, indeed, for this parliament. Since when did it become okay for Australia to decide that an individual's human rights should be put to a popular vote? Not that all LGBTI people wish to marry, but they sure as hell want to have the choice. Yet this government's non-binding, non-determinative, non-compulsory postal survey on marriage equality is tragic—nothing more than the result of this Prime Minister's complete and utter capitulation to the right wing of his party at the expense of his long-held principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can totally understand people's temptation to throw away this survey in disgust, to not dignify it with participation, but today I'm urging people in my community to think twice before doing so. Opting out will do nothing to advance the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in Australia. What it will do is to play into the hands of those who would hold off marriage equality indefinitely. This is a survey that Labor didn't want, it's a survey we don't support, and it's a survey we most certainly don't need. Regardless, that is where we are, and we simply can't abandon our LGBTI citizens when they need us most. We must stand up and let this government know that Australians understand that same-sex couples' love is just as real, and their relationships are just as valid, as any other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Same-sex couples are just as deserving of respect and equality, and we must do everything in our power to make sure the yes vote wins. With a price tag of $122 million, there is no doubt that the Prime Minister's postal survey is a breathtaking, reckless waste of money. It's shocking to think just what we could have done with this funding, if Mr Turnbull had had the courage to stand up to his right-wing masters. We could have employed 1,900 new teachers, we could have subsidised child care for more than 16,000 families a year or we could have funded 2.7 million bulk-billed visits to the doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, we're handing over the basic responsibilities of this parliament to a totally flawed, opt-in opinion poll. The suggestion that the parliament is suddenly incapable of doing its job, that we should farm out human rights decisions to a popular vote, is offensive and is wrong. In the 116-year history of this place we have passed hundreds of fundamental changes without asking the Australian people to do our job for us. We floated the dollar, we implemented universal health care, we initiated the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we've signed free trade deals, we've brought in world-leading gun reform, we've been to war and we've brokered peace—all without going to the public for their input.

         Prime Minister John Howard

        certainly saw no need to go to the Australian people when he changed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage Act
        </a>
        to stop marriage equality in 2004. So it's an utter nonsense that we have to do this in 2017. But by far the worst part of this terrible survey is that it will set off a damaging, divisive and hurtful campaign. The Prime Minister will be held to account for every hurtful comment, every damaging lie and every vicious slur.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regretfully, we can't stop this survey from happening, but what we can do is change the result. Today, I'm calling on all marriage equality supporters in my community, both young and old, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our LGBTI citizens, and support the yes vote. But first, you must be registered to vote. If you aren't registered, if you don't know whether you are or if you've moved house since the last election, please visit the
