        I rise today to acknowledge the fantastic work done in the community of Hasluck by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        in Forrestfield. From its base of nearly 600 local shareholders and a board consisting of well known local people such as chairperson Phil Mutter, deputy chairperson Nick Bruining,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
         Maureen Robinson
        </a>
        and too many more to mention here, the Forrestfield Bendigo Bank has donated over $370,000 since 2005 to nearly 100 local groups, schools and families. Young mothers, pensioners, war veterans, Indigenous people, P&amp;Cs, schools, wildlife sanctuaries and small businesses have all been recipients of grants from this altruistic local bank. On top of all its grants, the Bendigo Bank in Forrestfield has returned significant profits to its shareholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        What makes the grants given by the Bendigo Bank of Forrestfield so important is the level of support that they provide across the entire community of Hasluck. Take a moment to consider what Hasluck, or, indeed any other Australian community, would look like without these marvellous groups contributing to the fabric of our society. They cover the full spectrum of the community from grassroots clubs and sporting groups, to churches, charities, schools and health collectives. I mention some here so that the Australian public can hear just how benevolent and important is the work that the Bendigo Bank in Forrestfield undertakes every day.

        Kalamunda Home and Community Care, Forrestfield Uniting Church, Dawson Park Primary School's netball club and P&amp;C and Foothills YouthCARE have all received funding. New breast pumps for the

        aged persons' hostel was granted $3,485 to purchase equipment for a home theatre for its residents. Youth Action Kalamunda was given $3,500 in financial assistance for 17 Year 12 students to undertake a trip to Timor-Leste and assist with building renovation instead of going on a normal schoolies trip down south or to Bali. The Forrestfield United Soccer Club used a grant of $2,500 to purchase equipment for a senior six-a-side competition. The Foothills YouthCARE Chaplaincy program was given $2,000 for administration support of chaplains, who provide a fantastic service in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dawson Park Primary School was able to take its year 7 students on a history camp to Canberra as part of their political, cultural and history program thanks to $5,000 donated by the Bendigo Bank. The Foothills Early Years Community Partnership won $3,000 for the design and production of an early years calendar promoting the health, safety and wellbeing of young children. The HillSide Community Playgroup used their grant of $2,834 from the Bendigo Bank in Forrestfield for equipment, including a much-sought-after cubby house. The ChangeMakers program for youth received $1,920 for the production of anti-graffiti posters. Importantly, the Kanyana wildlife sanctuary took their $14,000 contribution and put it towards the purchase of a people and animal transporter to assist with its school education program.

        Our region has been hit hard by natural disasters, so it is fantastic that the Kalamunda Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade received $5,000 for a roller door and security system for the brigade headquarters. The Darling Range

        in Kalamunda was granted $4,386 for the purchase of kitchen equipment to help with catering on special days such as Anzac Day. One of the most significant grants was given to the Cancer Council of Kalamunda's respite centre. It received $42,000 for the purchase of a courtesy vehicle to transport clients and their families to and from the respite centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools were able to buy books, carers were given respite, sporting teams got new equipment and students won scholarships and were able to travel the world and broaden their horizons through the amazing support of the Bendigo Bank in Forrestfield. Organisations such as this support this country and pick up the gap in funding left by government. I would like once again to thank the Bendigo Bank in Forrestfield for supporting the community of Hasluck. Look no further than the above when searching for an example of what makes this country great.
