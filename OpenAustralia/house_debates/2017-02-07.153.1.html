        winner of ABC's Heywire is Mitchell Pitman. He is a 17-year-old boy from Leeville, who has faced many challenges. Born eight weeks premature and with cerebral palsy, Mitchell was also deaf. He was told he would never walk and never hear. Mitchell and his parents, Melanie and David, were determined to prove the doctors wrong. At age two Mitchell got a cochlear implant so he could hear, and, after a couple of years wearing splints, he could walk. But Mitchell's winning entry is not about the problems he faced in life: it is about how his school, Leeville primary, turned his life around and made him the person he is today. He says he was treated as a normal kid at school, playing touch footy on sharp gravel, and when he was down his friends would pick him up because that is what friends do. He says, 'I am really thankful.'

        Mitchell currently attends Casino High School and is studying year 12, as well as doing a traineeship at

        . After being told he would never walk, Mitchell has competed at state level, taking out bronze for running in the 'athletes with disabilities' category. I am looking forward to catching up with Mitchell, and Melanie and David, in
