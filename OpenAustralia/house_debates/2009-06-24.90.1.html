        <p>
         I thank the member for Dobell for his question. We have established a strong and direct relationship with local government. Last November we invited every mayor and shire president in the country to Canberra, to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         , to meet with the Prime Minister and the cabinet. As part of that partnership, we determined that we would have an ongoing steering committee of the ACLG. It has continued to meet, discussing microeconomic reform and the challenges confronted by local government—particularly those that have arisen recently as a result of the global economic recession.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year, in response to a request from ACLG, we have convened the second meeting of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Council
         </a>
         of Local Government here in Parliament House tomorrow morning. It will be opened by the Prime Minister and attended by cabinet members. The theme of this conference will be building resilience in local communities. Of course, communities have been affected by the global economic crisis, but particular communities have also had particular impacts—most notably the Victorian councils affected by the bushfire tragedy. The parliamentary secretary with responsibility for the Victorian bushfires has convened a special meeting this afternoon of all the councils to discuss responses to emergency situations such as that. My colleague the minister for Indigenous affairs has convened a meeting of councils with strong and large Indigenous communities, making sure as well that they are able to take the opportunity to inform government of their particular special needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, out of last year’s conference we had a number of very practical measures. We determined to establish a centre of excellence for local government—and an announcement is imminent as a result of a process whereby we asked for applications—so that we can get encouragement of best practice through local government. Tonight we have the Australian local government awards here in Parliament House as well. The centre of excellence for local government will be an important addition to local government in their ability to deal with the challenges, particularly the financial challenges, going forward. It will be about making sure that we learn from best practice and that we spread best practice in order to make sure that at the end of the day ratepayers receive best value for their contributions to local government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also last year announced the Regional and Local Government Community Infrastructure Program. At the time, we announced it would be $300 million. It now is $800 million. It has two components. The first is a $250 million component, with a proportion going out to all local government areas—that is, not just some but every single council in Australia will benefit from this program—for small projects and making a difference in their local communities. We also had a strategic project section of this announcement, some $550 million, which funded some 137 projects with a total value of some $1.5 billion. Those projects were for over $2 million. There was a competitive assessment process. Out of that we have announced a number of extraordinarily good projects around the nation—projects such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einasleigh_River_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
          Einasleigh River Bridge
         </a>
         in the electorate of the member for Kennedy—that will make a big difference. I have travelled around the nation, going to the electorates of the member for New England and the member for Lyne, who might like to pass on to the member for Kennedy that I mentioned this critical project. I also visited their electorates, it must be said, and these projects have been extraordinarily well received.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Wauchope Bonny Hills Surf Life Saving Club will now be rebuilt by that community. It is an important hub for community activity. In Tamworth we had a terrific day one Saturday with the member for New England. The member for New England organised for the local basketballers and the local kids to come along. They are going to get a sports centre. That will make a difference. It will bring economic activity to Tamworth. People from the region will be able to gather there. We were looking for projects that would be good for jobs immediately—particularly construction of libraries and sports facilities—but also good for the long term and leaving a lasting legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The message I gave to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Local Government Association
         </a>
         on Monday when I opened their conference was that local governments need to ensure that they fulfil the contracts they have been given, which is that work has to commence. We want this to be an important part of the economic stimulus, supporting jobs today and supporting local economies today but also making sure that we are building the local community infrastructure that we need for tomorrow.
