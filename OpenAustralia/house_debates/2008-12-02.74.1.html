        Last Sunday I attended the Thank a Volunteer Day breakfast organised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         City of South Perth
        </a>
        in my electorate of Swan. Credit must go to the

        , Cliff Frewing, and his staff for organising the awards ceremony. The event coincides with

        </a>
        , an event established by the

       <p>
        A total of 26 nominations were received from local community groups in the South Perth area. Four nominations were received for the City of South Perth Junior

        Award, for outstanding volunteers below the age of 18. Kurt Brownley and Jake Hasluck were nominated for their work with the Manning Magic Basketball Club. Charlotte Pitmann was nominated for her work with the South Perth Senior Citizens Centre. It is remarkable how much good volunteering work is undertaken on behalf of the elderly in my electorate and across the state, and this was recently recognised at the 2008 WA Seniors Awards. The Youth Sustainability Board of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Kids" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Kids
        </a>
        was also nominated in this category. Millennium Kids is a not-for-profit organisation run by young people and established in response to their demand for a greater say about their environment and their world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winner of this category was Bonnie Sutton, who was nominated for her work at the Esther Foundation over the past seven years. The Esther Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that operates a residential health and development program in South Perth for young women aged 14 to 35 wanting to get their lives back on track. The program is full time and provides support and accommodation for young women to overcome substance abuse, self-harming, suicide, family breakdown, domestic and sexual abuse, and mental health problems in a safe and structured environment. Bonnie devotes her spare time outside of school to this cause. Her passion and commitment to the cause is exemplary and commendable.
       </p>

        Young people between 18 and 25 were eligible for the City of South Perth Youth Volunteer of the Year Award. There were two nominations for this award. The South Perth Church of Christ Youth Team was nominated. In our increasingly secular society, religious organisations are often forgotten as valuable providers of volunteers. A recent survey conducted by my office has highlighted the good work undertaken by all religious denominations. The winners were Simon Treadgold and Joshua DuHeaume from South Perth Outreach. Simon and Joshua take time out from their university studies to facilitate a homework club which offers a safe and inviting place to come and receive free tutoring.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, 19 people were nominated for the City of South Perth Volunteer of the Year Award. Eligible persons were those over 25. Marjorie Barker was nominated for her work with the City of South Perth Historical Society, South Perth Old Mill. The South Perth Old Mill is a special cultural icon in South Perth, and I was pleased to be part of the effort to achieve funding for its renovation early in the year. Ada Bartlett of the South Perth Senior Citizens Centre and Ken Cleaver of Como Uniting Church were also nominated for this category.
       </p>
       <p>
        Development of young people through sport ensures a generation of healthy citizens. Ron Connolly has worked with the Southern Districts Touch Football Association and Rosemary Handley’s work with Spirit Gymsports meant that she was also nominated for the Volunteer of the Year award. Roy Snelgrove was nominated for his work with People Who Care, which is a volunteer based, non-profit and non-denominational charity helping the frail aged and people with disabilities to continue living independently for as long as possible. Care for senior citizens has an increasingly important role as the population is ageing. Roy Mouritzen was recognised for his work with the South Perth

        and Concorde Nursing Home while Kath Nielson and Dawn Shepherd were nominated for their volunteer work with the South Perth Senior Citizens Centre. I would also like to thank Roy for recently representing me at an

       </p>
       <p>
        Val Laughton was nominated for an award for her volunteer work with Kensington Secondary School, as was Penny Branch of Kensington Primary School. Karen Jones and Shelley Kraus were nominated for their work with

        Alumni Inc. and the Penhros School Council. Margaret Lofthouse was nominated for the Volunteer of the Year award for her work in the arts through South Perth Society of Arts and Crafts and the Embroiderers Guild of WA. Sue Gardiner was nominated as a volunteer for Save the Children. Like any parent, I respect the work that Save the Children does in securing and protecting children’s rights, and her efforts are to be commended. Similarly, Adrian Macdonald and Toni Mawer were nominated for their work with the South Perth Childcare Centre and their work with children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winner of the Volunteer of the Year award was Mr Kenneth Skinner. Kenneth is a volunteer for the Anglican Parish of Como/Manning, the

        It was a great honour to be at the awards and humbling to witness the selfless commitment of so many in my electorate. They are to be commended, and I am proud to represent them in this place.
