       <p>
        Australia's leading shipping and stevedoring company,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DP" rel="nofollow">
         DP
        </a>
        World, last week announced that it had entered into an exclusive agreement with TasPorts for a $30m international container terminal at the Port of Burnie. This is a massive vote of confidence in the Tasmanian economy, with 40 new local jobs and, more importantly, cheaper freight options for exporters throughout the state. The development will see Panamax-sized container ships servicing Burnie and carrying up to the equivalent of 4,250 20-foot containers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not surprised that this international company has picked Burnie for its next major development. The Tasmanian economy is finally heading in the right direction on many of the most significant indicators. Employment is at record levels, unemployment—which was over eight per cent when the Liberals came to government—is now 6.2 per cent, the national average, and our producers and advanced manufacturers are poised to take full advantage of the three free trade agreements signed by this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there are threats to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DP_World" rel="nofollow">
         DP World
        </a>
        announcement and threats to Tasmania's economic recovery. Those threats come from the Labor Party and others that are trying to scuttle the very reforms that are leading to economic growth for the entire Tasmanian economy. Key to ensuring the DP World development proceeds is the passing of the coastal shipping legislation. This legislation is an economic enabler for Tasmania. It creates the conditions that allow private businesses to expand and create jobs throughout the state. Under the coastal shipping amendments, a new international container shipping service out of Burnie would cut freight costs to China by nearly 50 per cent. That means every Tasmanian exporter would potentially save about $1,200 per 20-foot container.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a time when Australia has signed three free trade agreements in Asia that will cuts tariffs on the very best products, produce and services that Tasmania has to offer, it is inconceivable that any political party would make it more difficult for Tasmanian businesses to get those products to market. But there are three political parties actively opposing this legislation: Labor, the Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network. They want the federal government to artificially keep export costs high for all Tasmanian exporters, which will cost thousands of jobs. This is tantamount to running a protectionist racket for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
         MUA
        </a>
        workers at the expense of others. It is at the expense of good government and at the expense of economic prosperity for the entire state. They, along with the MUA, seem to forget that Tasmania has no other option but to use shipping. Our goods cannot go by rail; they cannot go by road. They must be shipped. Under the Labor Party,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        has been turned into the most expensive stretch of water in the world and it is hogtying our economy. The coastal shipping legislation before the Senate will now work hand in hand with the federal government's $203 million boost to the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and the $60 million investment in northern irrigation schemes. Labor has once again shown why it cannot be trusted with the economy. It seems to care more about protecting union jobs while putting others at risk—thousands of others. I call on all crossbench senators to consider the massive benefit of the coastal shipping amendments to the Tasmanian export business and to pass this legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sport is a crucial part of our economy and our community. Not only does it contribute to the health of our nation but it brings together people who sometimes have nothing else in common. Attending the north-west football finals are a great thing to behold. Locals from across the electorate join together to cheer on with their family and mates—Saturday and Sunday morning netball, hockey and soccer with young children, young adults and older generations coming out to take part. Local groups get together to improve themselves in some of the less common sports like canoeing, archery, equestrian and squash. The list goes on and on. In my electorate it is no different. There are many young people who have excelled to represent Tasmania, and even Australia, in a range of sports. It is critical that we as parents and community members encourage and support our young sportsmen and sportswomen, whether they are just learning or competing at a national level.

        -IGA Junior Sports Awards have listed their finalists for this year. This is a great way to recognise the dedication that these young people are showing to improving themselves in sport and in life. These individuals awards are for many sports. Not only do the junior sports awards recognise many of the great sports and the people in my electorate; they also recognise coaches, volunteers and officials. We would not be able to do what we do without their help. I wish all those nominated in
