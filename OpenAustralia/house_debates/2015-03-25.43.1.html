        I would like to take this opportunity today to compliment my two state Liberal colleagues

        state Labor in our South Coast was almost nil. We had schools in desperate need of repair, hospitals needing critical upgrades and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        suffering from years of neglect. In her first four years, Shelley worked tirelessly with the previous federal member for Gilmore, Jo Gash, and between them they managed some great improvements for our region. But, as every resident knows, since the change to a Liberal government came, with the help of Shelley Hancock for South Coast and Gareth Ward for Kiama, the rate of upgrades, improvement and infrastructure investment has been fantastic. These two Liberal MPs have worked constantly and consistently for our community, and our whole local area benefits. Our schools are improved, our hospital facilities are much better and the Princes Highway from Kiama to Berry will be brilliant, not to mention the work already done on the South Nowra section. The New South Wales Liberal government had to make tough decisions in the beginning, with a bad debt legacy from Labor, but the strategy has worked. New South Wales is moving ahead, and I look forward to working with these great elected members. Hopefully, they are very successful this Saturday and Baird is returned to government.
