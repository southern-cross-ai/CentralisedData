       <p>
        I welcome the decision announced yesterday by the Turnbull government to put the proposed backpackers' tax on hold. I spoke against the tax in the coalition party room and made representations to a number of our ministerial colleagues about the impact that the backpacker tax would have on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        economy. It is clear that this tax was a significant handbrake not only on the Northern Territory but also on regional and rural Australia. Hospitality, tourism and the primary sector are key industries that employ thousands of people across the Northern Territory, and there was enormous concern that the tax would deter potential workers from coming to the Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few months, I have met with representatives from key industries and passed on their concerns to my coalition colleagues. The government now agrees that further discussions with these vital industries are required to ensure that Australia does not lose the market share in backpacker visitation, and that our horticulture sector is able to recruit workers. The tourism minister, along with the ministers for agriculture, employment, immigration, regional development and industry as well as the Treasurer and the office of the Prime Minister and cabinet will now work together to prepare a revenue-neutral proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key issue is to ensure that we have a balanced and equitable approach to the tax status for workers here on visas. It is essential that we continue to put in place the right policy settings that support tourism, support hospitality, support the pastoral and horticultural industries in the Northern Territory economy as we transition out of the mining boom. I will continue to fight for jobs and investment and will always stand up for Territorians, because I am the Territory's voice in Canberra, not Canberra's voice in the Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to speak on another issue with the time I have left. I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are worried that they are going to be severely impacted, and even go broke, because of another Labor plan that they rammed through prior to the last election when they were voted out. Earlier this week, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal heard applications from AiG and other peak bodies to delay the commencement date of the payments order which applies to independent contractor drivers right across Australia. Given the significance of the structural reforms that were proposed, a reasonable period of time should be allowed for this to be implemented.
       </p>
       <p>
        After hearing the various parties, including the Commonwealth, the tribunal made the following orders. Firstly, the tribunal has published a draft amended order, which adopts a new commencement date of 1 January 2017 and the transitional provisions proposed by AiG. Secondly, interested parties have until midday on Monday, 21 March 2016 to comment on the draft amended order. Thirdly, interested parties can comment on each other's submissions until 24 March 2016. The matter will come back before the tribunal on 24 March, and at that time the tribunal will decide whether it will conduct a further hearing to hear from interested parties in person from 26 to 28 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite this development, the tribunal has not yet changed the commencement date of 4 April 2016. So I say to all those people who have contacted me about this issue: you have until midday on 21 March to make your submissions and specifically comment on the new commencement date. Do not assume that, just because you have made a submission previously, that submission will be considered by the tribunal. New submissions specifically supporting the draft amended order published this week must be lodged by 21 March if they are going to be considered by the tribunal. I repeat: you must make a new submission talking about the new commencement date so that the tribunal can consider that. It is very important that you do not assume your previous submissions about the date will be taken into consideration.
