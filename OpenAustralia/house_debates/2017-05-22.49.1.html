       <p>
        Last Friday night I had the very great honour of presenting the first female football team for the Rockingham Rams Football Club with their inaugural team jerseys. I am so grateful for the opportunity the Rockingham Rams have given me to help support this fantastic group of young women as they start a new page in the history books of this great footy club that was established over 60 years ago in Rockingham in 1954.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of my brothers, John and Matthew, both played for Rockingham many years ago. If the opportunity had been there I would love to have played footy instead of just being the little sister who had to fetch the footy from behind the goals or around the boundary, all the time watching my brothers play and my dad being the goal umpire. I am so happy that times have changed—very happy that times have changed—and that young girls and women now get to participate fully in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Rules
        </a>
        football, which is, as we know, the greatest game on this earth!
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the leadership of captain Dakota DalBello and vice captain Katy Millar, the team fought hard in the wind, rain and cold that whipped around Anniversary Park last Friday. Unfortunately, Rockingham went down by a single point to the tough country team Pinjarra. It was a hard-fought game played in the best possible spirit, if not the best weather. It was a strong defensive game in the back line, which kept the Rams in the hunt for the whole game.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the club president,

        ; the inaugural coach, Glen Millar; and the assistant coaches, Andrew and Tia, who are bright young people working hard for their club. I would also like to thank the hardworking manager, Bec, and all the volunteers on which the club depends. They have been so welcoming to me and I cannot wait to get along to another game. Go Rams!
