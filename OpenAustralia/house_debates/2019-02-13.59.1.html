       <p>
        There are two issues I wish to speak on today. First and foremost is the blue heart that I'm wearing, which is to deal with youth suicide. We have so many issues in regional Australia, but youth suicide has to be addressed. The most likely way people will die between, I think, the ages of 14 and 45, for males especially, is by their own hand, and I hope attention is brought to that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second issue is the fires that are currently happening in my electorate of New England. In Tingha, weâ€™ve had over 5,600 hectares burnt out. Tingha is a town between Inverell and Guyra which has a very high proportion of Aboriginal people in it. This fire is a big concern. The other one is at Wallangarra, which is near Jennings at the very top of my electorate, where over 5,000 hectares have been burnt out. About 25,000 acres are affected in those two fires alone. On the eastern side, at Jubullum, which is another Aboriginal community just before you cross the river, another fire is burning. These fires add to the stress of drought and I wish all the people fighting them and dealing with them the very best of luck and encouragement. I wish I was there. Obviously I can't be because we are sitting, but, as soon as I get my first opportunity, I will be down there to offer my support.
