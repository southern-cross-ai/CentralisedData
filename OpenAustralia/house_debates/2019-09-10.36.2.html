        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. If the economy is going as well as he claims, why did business confidence and condition numbers get worse again today, and why are they well below the long-term average?

         I am pleased to note that the confidence figures remain on the positive side of the ledger, and they remain on the positive side of the ledger despite the very complex and difficult challenges that the Australian economy faces. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party, who have taken to talking down the economy, what we can see on this side of the House is the opportunity in the Australian economy and the way forward for the Australian economy. The way you take the Australian economy forward is that you don't hold it down with higher taxes that crush the spirit of Australians. The Labor Party still holds on to $387 billion of taxes they want to put on the Australian economy.

            I remind the Prime Minister that, by definition, that implies he's the government leader. He needs to be relevant. I asked about government policy—nothing to do with Labor. I know he's obsessed, but it's about the economy, business confidence and what the government's doing about it.

              That's true, Mr Speaker. I was asked about confidence. I answered the question about confidence. At the last election, the Australian people expressed confidence in the economic plan that we took to the election. It was an economic plan that was about lowering taxes, that was about $100 billion in infrastructure investment, that was about expanding our export opportunities and that was about dealing with deregulation in the economy. Since the election we have announced that we are going to further deregulate measures that stymie investment and that we are working through the challenges that are faced in the industrial relations area. We took to the election our plan to keep the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Today Master Builders Australia are in the building; they're here at the moment. The Labor Party wanted to take away the rule of law in the building and construction industry, which would have taken people's jobs and rewarded union thugs like John Setka, who continues to stage a sit-in in the Victoria Labor Party. So whether it's the Setka sit-in in Victoria, the walkout of factions in

              or the corruption we're seeing in the New South Wales Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition is presiding over a party that is chaos and confusion and even corruption.
