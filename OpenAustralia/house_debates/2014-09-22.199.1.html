        Like for many, the last couple of weeks, or the last few days of last week, were very busy with year 12 graduation ceremonies around the state. I had the absolute privilege of going to the year 12 graduation ceremony at Woodlawn college. I congratulate Chris Comerford and all the staff on their great event, as well as

        . I went there the same day. The year 12 cohort had a lot of fun and had a great day as well. I then went to Southern Cross High School in Ballina. The principal, Peter, and his team put on a great display as well. My wife also represented me at her old school,

        in Goonellabah. She said that was a fantastic event and the enthusiasm of the staff there was infectious. She went to Casino High School for their year 12 graduation ceremony as well.

        The commitment of the teachers at these events is fantastic. The enthusiasm of students at these events is infectious. I know that now is a busy time for our year 12 students. They have their exams coming up. I think they have two weeks holiday or study time at the moment. They come back for a week and then they get into the exams. I wish them all the best.

        On Friday afternoon I dropped into Wollongbar primary school. I congratulate Lachlan, who won a book award that I gave out. He is a great kid. He won it for the great spirit that he shows in his school community.
