        I rise to congratulate and thank those people that were recognised this year with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        awards in my electorate for their contributions to their communities. Firstly, Dr Myrle Gray AM has been honoured for her service to rural medicine in Tasmaniaâ€”a familiar face to the communities of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Town
        </a>
        and Oatlands. She was President of the Rural Doctors Association of Tasmania from 2010 to 2014 and a board member of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia for the same period. I know many people in those communities recognise the extraordinary work that Dr Gray does within her community. I understand she was originally from Brisbane. On finishing university, her first posting was to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Isa
        </a>
        , and she found her way to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_River" rel="nofollow">
         Savage River
        </a>
        in Tasmania and ended up at Oatlands.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know Ian Mackinnon very well. He has been a farmer, a grain and livestock producer, in the northern Midlands for many years. He has more than 40 years of experience in contributions particularly to agri-politics, research and development. I know that he has been an active participant within the Grains Research &amp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Development Corporation
        </a>
        . The award that he has received recognises the passion he has for young people to take up careers in agriculture.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke yesterday to Emeritus Professor John Coll, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Midway Point
        </a>
        in my electorate. John has now retired to Tasmania. His award recognises his significant service to tertiary education as administrator, academic and researcher; to the environment; and to the community. He is a chemist, specifically involved with marine science. He is also well involved in the community through Sing Australia in Sorell, with the youth throughout Kingston and in other roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kearney" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Kearney
        </a>
        , who I know very well, was principal for many years at the Hagley Farm Primary School. He now lives on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        in Lanena. He is a very decent man. He is a committed educationalist, but also, as a councillor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar_Council" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar Council
        </a>
        , has continued that commitment to his community. It is a well-deserved recognition for Peter Kearney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Peter Maher, from Longford, is recognised for service to the community through a range of sporting and service organisations. I spoke to Peter the other day. It is people like him that build communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise Peter Geard, of Brighton, and Mr Kelvin Jones, of Swansea, who received an Emergency Services Medal, and Mr Colin Cunningham, of Gretna, who received a Fire Service Medal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also mention the former member for Bass, Mr Geoff Lyons, who is now a councillor on the West Tamar Council, for the work he has done over many years with Marine and Safety Tasmania and Surf Life Saving Tasmania. His recognition in this year's Australia Day awards was indeed well deserved.
