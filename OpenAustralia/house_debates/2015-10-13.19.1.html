       <p>
        This week is National Carers Week and it is a time to recognise and celebrate the outstanding contribution that Australia's unpaid carers make to our nation. There are 2.7 million carers in Australia who provide unpaid care and support to family members and friends with a disability, a mental illness, a chronic condition, a terminal illness or who are frail aged. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Carers Group, I am very aware of the huge contribution they make. Just a few weeks ago, we launched a report on the economic impact that carers have in Australia. It is estimated that in 2015, carers will provide $1.9 billion of unpaid care. The cost of that care were it provided by paid care workers is estimated at $60.3 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        People can help raise awareness this National Carers Week by making a free pledge to help build a more carer-friendly Australia. Carers contribute so much to our community and yet they often experience social isolation and find it harder to maintain employment, enter the workforce or participate in education. A carer-friendly Australia is one where unpaid carers are recognised and supported during and after their caring role, across all spectrums of society. I encourage others to join me in making the pledge to help build a more carer-friendly Australia by going to www.carersweek.com.au or tweeting something with the hashtag 'carers2015'.
