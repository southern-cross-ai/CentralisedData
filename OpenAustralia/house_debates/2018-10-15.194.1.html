        October is Mental Health Month. It is estimated that one in five Australians will experience a mental health problem during their lifetime. As a pharmacist who worked in the mental health inpatient units at Wyong Hospital for much of my career, this awareness month matters.

        , on National headspace Day, I held a forum at the Gravity Youth Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Haven" rel="nofollow">

        to hear directly from young people about their experiences. I was heartbroken to hear of the struggles that many experienced trying to get help for themselves or others. It is apparent that stigma persists and that there are many barriers for those seeking help for themselves or loved ones. We have some excellent services on the coast, including headspace, and I would like to acknowledge their support in holding this forum. But services are under strain and must be properly funded, particularly in the regions.

        We also need to talk about mental health openly if we are going to change the statistics. Studies have found that it is not harmful to ask someone if they are thinking about taking their own lifeâ€”in fact, it can be extremely helpful. We must work together to address this national crisis. I urge everyone to check in with their loved ones, friends and colleagues this month. I also encourage everyone to think about taking a mental health first aid course. We encourage people to speak about mental health. Often people want to help but don't have the necessary experience to do so. I renewed my mental health first aid recently. This training helps equip you with the basic skills which may help you to save a life. I encourage other people to think about taking mental health first aid this month.
