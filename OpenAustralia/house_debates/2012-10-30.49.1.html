        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement on 13 April last year: 'My commitment to a surplus in 2012-13 was a promise made and it will be honoured.' Does the Prime Minister stand by that promise?

          </small>
          <p>
           I thought the leader of the opposition might want to know the views of his Liberal team. On the question he asked me, as I said in answer to the shadow minister for immigration's question, we have just delivered—as the leader of the opposition may know—the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In it we have delivered billions of dollars in savings to return the budget to surplus and we are on track to deliver it.
          </p>
          <p>
           What I would be interested to know from the leader of the opposition is whether or not, when those savings are presented to the parliament, the opposition will vote in favour of them or against them. They have been out there in the community basically saying that they are opposed to them but will they vote for them or against them? The leader of the opposition cannot be taken seriously on these questions (1) because he has not clarified that (2) because the opposition has a $70-billion black hole and (3) because the opposition is running, hiding and refusing to submit its figures to Treasury for proper costing.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it comes to these questions of budget management, from the days of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
            Peter Costello
           </a>
           to now, it has been apparent that the leader of the opposition has no credibility. And no day in opposition has served him well because there is not one day that he has bothered to make a new policy statement of substance. There is not one day that he has done a proper costing. There is not one day that he has promised to put his figures in for proper assessment. There is not one day that he said he is prepared to abide by the charter of budget honesty. Until he does so then his contributions in this debate will be weighed for their worth, which is absolutely nothing.

            </a>
            in 2010 whether she could guarantee a budget surplus this year, her answer was an unequivocal 'yes'. Is this guarantee now as believable as 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?

             I am in a position where I will have to withdraw a statement. I withdraw that the leader of the opposition read Phil Coorey's column this morning; clearly, that is not true. On the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, I stand by the words that I have just answered in the first part of the leader of the opposition's question. On the question of wording about surplus, I do recall the time in February where in three or four days the leader of the opposition said they would have a surplus 'as quickly as possible', the shadow minister for finance said 'it just depends', the shadow Treasurer said 'as soon as possible' and then the member of Sturt reverted to type and said he 'would have to look at the books'. Where have we heard that before? From Campbell Newman.

                Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. As I answered earlier, have a look at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in which we have delivered billions of dollars of savings, adding to the billions of dollars of savings that we have delivered in the past. What that means is we stand by the figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and we are on track to deliver as the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook outlines.
