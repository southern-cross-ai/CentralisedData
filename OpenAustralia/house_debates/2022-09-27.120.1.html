       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute today to beloved members of our community who we have lost recently. I begin with my friend and Burt community leader, Mr Salim Youssef. Salim—or Sam, as many of us knew him—was a powerhouse in our community who we recently lost too soon on 31 August. Salim came to Australia in 1991, fleeing war in Lebanon and settling in Perth in 1988.
       </p>
       <p>
        Salim's legacy will be the Australian Arab Association. He recognised the importance of diverse voices and points of view being heard. Salim and his wife, Amal, had a vision of a truly multicultural society, and our community will be forever proud of what they have achieved. The Australian Arab Association of WA is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious organisation that aims to help all newcomers to Australia, especially those of Arab origin, and to provide a friendly place to socialise and to reach services and opportunities. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA
        </a>
        has always been about outreach and bringing communities together, especially through their annual Eid and multicultural festivals, which have grown every year and provide an amazing opportunity for the sharing of cultures.
       </p>
       <p>
        More recently, Sam and his brother, Raif, started a Lebanese sweets and catering business, following in the footsteps of their father in Lebanon. It is the only such business in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Sam's support for our community is also reflected in his extensive community work, including with Rotary, in the area of health care, as a local justice of the peace and a key member of the WA government's multicultural advisory council. Sam's work has been recognised by state, local and national awards, including as a People of Australia Ambassador in 2012 and 2014. Sam was a dedicated member of the

        </a>
        , serving as president of Gosnells Thornlie branch in Burt and working with the state MPs. He always supported me and supported our state MPs, such as

        </a>
        , in our campaigns and in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Salim will be deeply missed by so many of us. You were such a great friend. I offer our sincere condolences to Amal; his children, Natasha and Aisha; and the extended Youssef family, colleagues and friends. Vale Salim Youssef.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the family of Mike Devereux, a former deputy mayor of the City of Gosnells and Labor stalwart. He was someone I met and shared office with in the then Canning Electorate Council. He taught me so much about the importance of grassroots politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd to like to remember a titan of our community, the Gosnells
