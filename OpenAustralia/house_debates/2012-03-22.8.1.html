       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the government's tax reforms is to encourage and support capital investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill 2012 delivers a best-in-class internationally competitive tax reform package.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax concessions contained in this bill aim to address the cost disadvantages faced by Australian ship owners and encourage renewal of the ageing Australian fleet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These concessions are available to companies that satisfy the qualifying conditions and hold a valid certificate, as set out in the Shipping Reform (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Incentives" rel="nofollow">
         Tax Incentives
        </a>
        ) Bill 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to each of these concessions:
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from income tax for ship operators
       </p>
       <p>
        International experience in Europe, Asia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
         South America
        </a>
        shows that the introduction of financial support—usually in the form of a tonnage tax and personal tax breaks for seafarers working in the international trade—has had substantial and very positive effects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill I introduce today goes a step further—the government is not introducing a new tax in the form of a tonnage tax—instead it exempts qualifying income from shipping from taxation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this provision is that Australian resident companies with vessels registered in Australia, including those on the international register, will not pay company tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, a generous approach is taken to defining these activities that generate eligible shipping income.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accelerated depreciation
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill provides ship owners with an accelerated rate of depreciation for their ships.
       </p>
       <p>
        When introducing the previous bill, I mentioned before Australia has an old fleet compared to international standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is in part due to our depreciation rate for vessels being set at 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill cuts that rate in half.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new depreciation rate will be 10 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision has multiple effects.
       </p>
       <p>
        An economic benefit—the cost of operating a 20-year-old large bulk carrier is at least 40 percent more than for a five-year-old ship.
       </p>
       <p>
        A safety and environmental benefit—newer vessels incorporate new technology making them safer and more environmentally friendly.
       </p>
       <p>
        An employment benefit as ship building is encouraged.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roll over relief
       </p>
       <p>
        The rollover relief concession provides that if a ship is disposed of, ship owners will be able to defer tax due on a balancing adjustment amount by two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a replacement ship is purchased by the end of the two years, the balancing adjustment will be rolled over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Combined with the accelerated depreciation concession, ship owners will have a greater incentive to invest in more modern and efficient ships. Refundable Tax Offset
       </p>
       <p>
        It makes no sense that an Australian seafarer working on a ship in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_London" rel="nofollow">
         Port of London
        </a>
        should pay Australian income tax while an Australian working as a bartender in a pub in London does not.
       </p>
       <p>
        This creates a disincentive for hiring Australian seafarers in international trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequently, the bill provides for a refundable tax offset for employers of Australian resident seafarers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The seafarer tax offset provides an incentive for a company to employ Australian seafarers on overseas voyages.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will also provide Australian seafarers with the opportunity to develop their maritime skills on ships operating in international trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        For an employer to qualify for the offset, the seafarer must have served on overseas voyages for at least 91 days in the income year on an eligible vessel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Royalty Withholding Tax
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, payments made for the lease of shipping vessels from foreign resident lessors will be exempt from royalty withholding tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        This exemption applies to payments made by Australian resident companies for the lease, on a bareboat basis, of qualifying vessels that are used commercially to ship cargo or passengers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This element is aimed at reducing the costs for Australian shipping operators of securing vessels from overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, these tax arrangements ensure investment in Australian shipping will continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
