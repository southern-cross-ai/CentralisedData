        Mr Speaker, I have a question of you. Prior to question time when the member for Werriwa was speaking the only person to pay deference to the convention of the line of sight between the Speaker and the member speaking was the opposition leader. All others walked past that line of sight, which I thought was inappropriate for the member for Werriwa whilst he was speaking. I have been out of this House a couple of times since 1990. Has the convention changed?

         . He raises a valid point of order. It is a standing order, not a convention. I think that, from what he has raised, all members ought to remind themselves of that standing order. This is a good opportunity to make the point. We might even circulate a note about it as well.

          Mr Speaker, I just want to correct the record. The member for

           McMillan

           <p>
            Mr Speaker, I find myself in great difficulty. The honourable member for Melbourne asked a question of you relating to the standing orders which you would not encourage to go further, and you indicated you are only taking questions on administration. Yet when a government member raises what you called a point of order, you are only too happy to answer it. I am completely perplexed by one ruling about a matter where the opposition clearly needs to get a greater understanding about components that are not necessary in questions. We are seeking detail on that, and we are being told that we cannot make those inquiries of you. But, when an issue of the standing orders is raised by a government member, you not only allow it, you classify it as a point of order and give a very fulsome answer, which I do not object to, by the way.

              Mr Speaker, as to your response to my question re the number of expulsions in the House, you say that it is not about punishment but about keeping good order. Do you not think there might be better order in the House if there was a perception of a more balanced approach re 109 versus four?
