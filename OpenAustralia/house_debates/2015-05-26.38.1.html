        My question is to the Prime Minister. According to the Liberal Party, NATSEM is Australia's foremost modelling consultant. Given that independent NATSEM modelling shows that a typical family will be more than $6,000 a year worse off because of the Prime Minister's budget, can the Prime Minister outline the assumptions in the government's own modelling that shows the impact of the government's changes on families, and when will the Prime Minister release the Treasury's modelling?

              What a champion the 10,700 small businesses of Robertson have in their member; what a champion. Whenever I am there I am reminded again that small business and family enterprises are the economy of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
               Central Coast
              </a>
              , and they are lucky to have such a great advocate. And it has been a pleasure to hear what an overwhelmingly positive response there has been on the Central Coast to the government's jobs and small business package. It hits the right mark, because it is what small business wants, what they need to grow, and how we can best support small business to create more jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are committed to actually delivering on these commitments. Contrast that with Labor. And who could forget the hapless member for Gorton? He was Labor's small business minister No. 5 or 6. I cannot remember; there was a revolving door—five Labor small business ministers in 15 months. And there he was, on budget eve, spruiking a small business company tax cut, and then when the budget was delivered it was not actually in it. A lot can happen under Labor overnight, can't it, Bill? We will see more about that in the television series that is coming up. But small businesses know that they have been stooged again by Labor. The coalition will not let the small business community down. We have been working hard to create the right economic conditions so that the economy has been able to create a quarter of a million more jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the centrepiece of our budget is all about energising enterprise for small business—a fair dinkum small business company tax cut to bring it to the lowest it has been in almost 50 years. And we will not just talk about it; we will deliver it. We will make sure it is delivered, and also the immediate tax deduction for any and all assets purchased by small business, up to $20,000. These measures will help us to recover the 519,000 jobs in small business lost under Labor and will provide the momentum so that small businesses can create more jobs. That is our goal, and that has been understood by those who have looked at the package—responsible, measured, welcome initiatives that will get behind the enterprising men and women of small business.

              of the Central Coast business chamber said that the budget may allow the small business owner to employ that extra apprentice or extend the hours of a current employee. Mike Waller from Peninsular Office Supplies in Umina said that this was a great initiative and that he can get that much-needed new delivery van.

Are they going to stand in the road? Labor, you did not do anything for small business when in office. Make sure you get behind this package and secure its early, safe and certain passage.
