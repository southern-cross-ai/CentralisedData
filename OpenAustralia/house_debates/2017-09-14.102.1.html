       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. There are reports today that up to 10 coalition MPs are considering crossing the floor over the government's energy policy, like the Prime Minister did before them. Why is the current Prime Minister still letting the former Prime Minister and the right-wing members of his government dictate government energy policy? What was the point of deposing the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, when he's still in control two years later?

          My question is to the Minister for Aged Care. Will the minister inform the House why a reliable and affordable energy supply is important for aged care homes? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches that would jeopardise the quality of care for older Australians?

           I thank the member for Bennelong for his continued interest in aged care. I was concerned when I read in the Queensland
           <i>
            Courier-Mail
           </i>
           that soaring power prices and shortages could disrupt aged care services, putting old people at risk. You asked me what a risk is in all of this. I want to say that this government recognises the importance of good energy policy and security, and this is why we've taken decisive action to act on this issue. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Market_Operator" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Energy Market Operator
           </a>
           , Audrey Zibelman said, 'The power system does not have the reserves it once had, and therefore a balance of peak summer demand in real time provides a heightened risk to supply.'
          </p>
          <p>
           I know that the issues we currently face are a direct result of Labor's total lack of action on energy policy in government and their ideological pursuit of higher energy prices and an unstable energy system. Labor admitted its role in creating this problem when the member for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
            Port Adelaide
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butler" rel="nofollow">
            Mark Butler
           </a>
           , said on
           <i>
            Insiders
           </i>
           in August, 'Everyone knew there was going to be an impact on prices.' Labor's own energy white paper in 2012 stated that there are likely to be short-to-medium term transitional pressures in the eastern market.

             These will manifest in tighter supply and higher prices yet, despite this advice, Labor did nothing. While the Labor Party, with blackouts around the country, is twiddling its thumbs, the government has implemented mechanisms to lift the restrictions on gas exports to ensure there is adequate supply of affordable gas for Australian consumers. The contrast could not be clearer. We have a party of blackouts opposite that is ideologically opposed to affordable and reliable energy and that ignores its own warnings and risks to its policies and does nothing. This government and this Prime Minister are focused on putting downward pressure on electricity prices and ensuring that all Australians, particularly older Australians, have a reliable source of energy into the hot summer months. That is why the building of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
              Snowy Hydro
             </a>
             2.0 will make renewable energy more reliable. Nothing is more concerning than seeing older Australians being put at risk because of energy policies from those on the other side. We will ensure that they're cared for and that electricity reliability looks after them during the winter and summer months, when they become vulnerable.

                  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's earlier answer. If the Prime Minister considers that the energy policies of the previous Labor government were so bad, why did he cross the floor to vote for them? Why did the Prime Minister ever claim, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am?' And, finally, why won't the Prime Minister stand up to the former Prime Minister for anything other than keeping his own job?

                   I'll tell you one of the important measures of effective energy action: it's keeping the lights on. It's ensuring Australians don't have to pay the blackout bill. Effective action involves, if you have a windmill and a solar farm, having some backup when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. That's what's called effective. But ideology and idiocy have been the hallmarks of the Labor Party's approach to energy. I'll give you another measure of effectiveness: an effective energy policy is one where Australians can afford to pay for energy. Labor's failed on both counts.
