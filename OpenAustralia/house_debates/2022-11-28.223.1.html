       <p>
        Representing your country on the world stage is the highest honour you can achieve in your sporting career. Aaron Batchelor is a passionate pool plyer from Muswellbrook. He is a board member of the Australian Blackball International Federation and is also the head coordinator of the learning and physical disability section. Aaron's story is truly inspiring. Unfortunately, Aaron had a stroke when he was nine years old and was told by doctors that he would never play sport again. But after being invited to go and play some pool with his best mate, Tim, he discovered a new passion. Aaron discovered that despite having no movement in his fingers and minimal movement in his elbow and shoulder, he could rest a pool cue on his arm and use his right arm to shoot the ball.
       </p>

        Earlier this year Aaron was selected to represent Australia at the Blackball World Championships in Morocco in October. He was also chosen to be the flag bearer for the Australian team. What a great honour that would be. Aaron finished fourth in the singles event and the disabled team finished third in the world. Congratulations, Aaron, and your team, on a successful world championships, and I look forward to having a game of pool with you at a pub shortly.
