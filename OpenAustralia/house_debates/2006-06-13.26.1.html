        My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline for the Ryan electorate recent data on the Australian economy? What does this indicate about the Australian economic outlook? Are there any threats to this economic outlook?

        <p>
         I am very happy to outline for the Ryan electorate what is happening with the national economy. The national accounts were released for the March quarter last week, and they showed that growth in Australia has kicked up, growing 0.9 per cent for the March quarter and 3.1 per cent through the year, which is a significant tick-up. Household consumption was moderate, and national growth was led by business investment. New machinery and equipment investment grew by 1.5 per cent and is 27.1 per cent higher through the year. Although private engineering construction fell in March, it remains 13.8 per cent higher through the year. Exports grew by 0.5 per cent, whilst imports grew by only 0.4 per cent. As a consequence of that, net exports did not detract from growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are now seeing the Australian economy adjusting out of what was unsustainable housing investment and into business investment and we are beginning to see increasing export volumes. The good news about the growth in the national economy is that new jobs continue to be created, with 56,000 new persons given jobs in the month of May. All members of the House will welcome the fact that new jobs were created in the month of May. Over the last year, 172,000 new jobs have been created. I am asked about threats to the economy.

            I am asked what threats there are to the economy. Obviously there are threats from international factors such as oil prices, which are not good for the economy, but the greatest threat to the Australian economy domestically—in Ryan!—would be the election of the Leader of the Opposition. I can think of nothing that could be worse for the Australian economy than

            being in a position of influence. Unemployment went below five per cent last week, and the Leader of the Opposition was nowhere to be seen. As a journalist in the
            <i>

              I will make two points for the benefit of the member for Grayndler. Firstly, as I heard the question, the Treasurer was asked to tell the electors of Ryan about the economy. Secondly, the Treasurer should refer to members by their seat or by their title.

               Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders require that members remain in their seats. I would point out to you that the Chief Opposition Whip seems to be putting himself in line for the cameras and he should be asked to take his seat.

                   I am in the process of explaining threats to the Australian economy. There could be no greater threat to the Australian economy than the Leader of the Opposition being in a position of influence. As the journalist recorded in the
