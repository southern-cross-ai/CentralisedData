       <p>
        The people in the Mallee should be able to drive on a decent road, have adequate telecommunications, have good educational opportunities for their children and know that when they go do the doctor there will be a doctor there and they can get treated. The focus of my job is looking after not only the big towns but all our great country towns. In October, I will be on the road doing a great country towns tour across the Wimmera Mallee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of those great country towns are Kaniva and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lake" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Both are towns that are currently not on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout for fixed wireless. I have told NBN Co that it's going to be cheaper for them to put a tower in those towns than to respond to the letters that I'm going to write, time and time and time again, to get that happening. I have written to the Minister for Communications and the Arts,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Fifield" rel="nofollow">
         Mitch Fifield
        </a>
        —this is my third letter to the minister—and I am confident that we will get there. Kaniva has a population of 1,000. It has a school of 200 students from prep to year 12. Sea Lake has a population of 600 people and is a growing town with two great schools. I'm not going to give up. I believe in the future of country towns.
       </p>
       <p>
        We talk about inland cities, but our country towns have a future. Our country towns have a future because our government is going to deliver one for them. The people who live in these towns are great Australians. They deserve to have access to a fixed wireless internet, and I'm going to get it for them. We won't give up.
