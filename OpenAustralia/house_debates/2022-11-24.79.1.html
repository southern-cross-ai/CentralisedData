       <p>
        This weekend the people of Victoria will make an extremely important decision. The Andrews government has achieved so much in relation to transport, climate change and service delivery over the last eight years. So much more needs to be done by this excellent government. The Andrews government has a strong record of getting people into work, creating jobs through the Big Build, through social procurement and through service delivery and health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an Australian first, Victorians in casual and insecure jobs will no longer be forced to choose between a day's pay and looking after their health, thanks to the Victorian Sick Pay Guarantee, which provides up to five days pay, a valuable safety net for vulnerable workers. There is the $3,000 appreciation payment for all staff employed in public health services, and I could go on and on about health care and other areas of service delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Melbourne's west is one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia, and the Andrews government has the runs on the board. The new $1.5 billion Footscray Hospital is one of the largest health infrastructure projects in Australia. More than $48 million is expected to be invested through Indigenous and social enterprises, including disability and disadvantaged businesses. There is also the investment in my electorate in the Joan Kirner Women's and

        . And there have been so many schools upgraded, so many level crossings removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an extremely important choice this weekend, between a party, an opposition, focused on internal and extremist politics, with a leader who hasn't changed after he was rejected, and a government with a track record and a plan for the future.
