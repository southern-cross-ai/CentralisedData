        Warrandyte, in my electorate, is not just a suburb; it is a communityâ€”a community of families, of sport, of friendship and of people who serve others. It's a community that is proud of its history and hopeful for all our futures. It's a community that loves our

        , cherishes our green space and cares for our wildlife. It's a community with a strong sense of self and a beating, compassionate heart. After one moment of horror in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        , this community is now in shock and grief. The bride and groom were originally Warrandyte locals. Many of the guests were their family and friends who made the trip from Warrandyte, and Darcy Bulman, who lost her young and promising life, was from Warrandyte. Her family and friends are in mourning, and her partner, Nick, who was with her, remains in hospital.

        I am so proud of how Warrandyte has responded. I'm so proud of the volunteers and members of the Warrandyte Cricket Club, the Warrandyte Football Club, the Warrandyte Netball Club and the

        for wrapping their arms around each other and those affected. I'm so proud of our community, who have called our office and asked how they can donate blood, offered financial support and begged to help. Warrandyte is hurting, but Warrandyte is the best of us. They are there for each other, and we are there for them.
