       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the amendments be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had a long debate in the Senate last night, a very significant debate, and I would like to thank all of those senators that contributed. There are four sets of amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 that have come to the House from the Senate, which are agreeable to the government. Indeed, they were not divided on in the Senate last night. I will go through those sets of amendments that we're talking about right now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must say that these amendments came from extensive consultation and the Senate committee report. I would like to thank the Chair, Senator Marielle Smith, and all the senators who worked on that report, who did a great job.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first set of amendments before us strengthen the Family Responsibilities Commission and the work they do. I would be surprised if those opposite vote against the strengthening of the Family Responsibilities Commission. These amendments to do with that group have been endorsed by the Family Responsibilities Commission themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second set of amendments allows for a transition for those in the four
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
         CDC
        </a>
        sites. They will be able to get voluntary income management to transition seamlessly on 6 March to an enhanced technological card. We heard that people wanted a seamless transition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third set of amendments, the government amendments, allow for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        participants on the CD card to transition to an enhanced technology also on 6 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, as moved in the Senate by Senator Rice, is the requirement for me, as minister, to table a services plan to ensure that all of the CDC sites get a services plan. Indeed, we table the costs of the CDC itself under the former government.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are sensible amendments. They do improve the bill. They are the result of listening to communities. Therefore, I commend the amendments to the House.

         The question is that the amendments be agreed to.
