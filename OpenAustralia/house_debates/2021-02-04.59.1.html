        and new year period was particularly challenging for greater Sydney, with several clusters of COVID-19 requiring the rethink of Christmas and new year plans. I'd like to congratulate

        and Mayor Wendy Waller for their foresight. Even before that round of restrictions they had organised a COVID-friendly fireworks display. The event could be seen from all over the council area and attracted thousands of viewers across the electorate. The fireworks were launched from several points, high into the sky. At the family friendly time of 9 pm I was lucky enough to be able to see them from my backyard, with a nearly 360-degree view. Liverpool were the only council in Sydney to provide residents with a safe and responsible fireworks display that could be enjoyed from the comfort and safety of their own backyards. The show featured aerial shells and wired effects and maximised the visibility for all to see within the firing site, well clear of people's homes, and the soundtrack to accompany the fireworks was broadcast on local radio 2GLF. There was an incredible response from the community, with positive comments from residents, as well as me, as we all had the pleasure of viewing the amazing display from home. We will need to continue to do things differently as we endure this pandemic. This is one example of how we can adapt and keep our community together but also distant. Congratulations to Liverpool City Council, Mayor Waller and everyone involved in the event for making it a resounding success.
