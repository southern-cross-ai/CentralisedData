He has chaired the referees and judges committee since 2009 and officiated at international competitions, including the Olympics, for nearly 30 years. OAM recipient Marie Standen was the founder of the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group 20 years ago.

An Ambulance Service Medal was awarded in the Blue Mountains to Steven Lobley, recognising his 30-year commitment as a paramedic, in particular his work on the specialist wilderness and remote area response team. The Australian Corrections Medal was awarded to Louisa Van Mal, who has committed herself to the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates at Corrective Services New South Wales.
