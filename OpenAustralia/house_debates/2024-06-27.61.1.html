        Thank you, Deputy Speaker. You may not be deaf, but I think I am. Today is the last sitting day before the celebration of a new financial year, mainly by the accountants and tax professionals in the community. To them, happy new year! The upcoming financial year will be a big one. It'll be known as the year of the tax cut. With the new financial year on Monday 1 July, there will undoubtedly be many more people out in the community with more reasons to celebrate. Those people include 100 per cent of all Australian taxpayers, who will be receiving a tax cutâ€”not some but all. That's 13.6 million taxpayers. This is especially true for the 84 per cent of taxpayers, or 91 per cent in Spence, who will be receiving an even bigger tax cut because the Albanese Labor government fought for them to be able to keep more of what they earn. Just four more sleeps to go.

        'It's the final countdown.' Both the chorus and the iconic riff from that song have been stuck in my head from the moment I started writing this. I only partly apologise to anyone else who will now end up sharing the same fate. As we all know, there are much worse fates to be had. Fates like having the Liberal and National coalition with the opposition leader, the member for Dickson, at the helm, with an energy policy that's more nuclear fizzer than nuclear fission and wanting Australians to work more and earn less. I'm proud to be on this side of the chamber fighting for Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn.
