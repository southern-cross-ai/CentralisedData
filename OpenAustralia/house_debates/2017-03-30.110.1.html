        My question is to the Prime Minister. Margarita is a 58-year-old widow and grandmother who works as a housekeeper in a hotel. She is sitting in the gallery today. Because the Prime Minister supports cutting penalty rates, Margarita tells me that she will lose $2,000 from her take-home pay of about $30,000. She says this money is the difference between staying afloat or drowning in bills and costs. She wants to know: why is the Prime Minister doing nothing to stop her pay being cut?

         We understand the battle that Margarita has. We understand that—all Australians do. We applaud her as a widow working hard, as so many Australians do. But I will say this: the honourable member has asserted that Margarita's employer is going to reduce her pay. Is that the case? I will give the Leader of the Opposition the opportunity to assure us that he has made that inquiry and that her pay will be cut.

           The honourable member has brought Margarita here. We applaud Margarita. She has an employer. But we do not know who the employer is. The employer has said he will cut her wages; is that right?

           Oh, no—the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to go that far! The truth is that the one thing I can say for sure is that Margarita is lucky not to have the Leader of the Opposition representing her, because she would be sold down the river like the cleaners at Clean Event. Perhaps the honourable member, who will not tell us who the employer is, might tell us what the money—the $75,000—that came from Clean Event was really for. Those workers' penalty rates were reduced in a deal with the union that the opposition leader led.
