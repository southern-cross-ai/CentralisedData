       <p>
        While Maclean District Hospital sits just outside my electorate of Page in Cowper, thousands of my constituents in the Lower Clarence rely on it. Many constituents hold real fears about the future of their hospital, particularly if the

        is transferred to Grafton Base Hospital 45 kilometres away to become the DON for both

        hospitals. Ordinarily such a centralisation proposal, obtained by the
        <i>
         Daily Examiner
        </i>
        newspaper, might make sense. However, coming at the same time as the North Coast Area Health Service is deleting a total of 400 positions from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">

        for budgetary reasons, my constituents see this hospital management restructure as a body blow to their smaller hospital. The ladies of the Maclean Lower Clarence Hospital Auxiliary have written to me saying they cannot see how one director of nursing can be expected to provide fair management to two hospitals. Neither can I. They say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This could well be a precursor to our hospital being downgraded even further and therefore jeopardising the level of service provided to our community, which continues to grow steadily, thus putting more pressure on the hospital and its staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I understand the need for belt tightening in the context of responding to the global recession, I share the community concerns that the target of 400 positions will put too much pressure on front line health workers and potentially affect the quality and viability of hospital services. As a starting point, I am asking that the existing management arrangements for Maclean and Grafton hospitals remain in place and unchanged. I note in today’s
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Star" rel="nofollow">

        </i>
        , the newspaper at the other end of my electorate, that the editorial heading is ‘Health system needs injection of sense’. I agree.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a positive note I report that two of my major election commitments from 2007—redevelopment of Grafton Base Hospital’s operating theatres and emergency department and the fast-tracking of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lismore_Base_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        ’s radiotherapy unit—are progressing well. At the end of budget week I returned to Grafton to see the North Coast Area Health Service Lodge a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DA" rel="nofollow">

        for three new operating theatres with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley Council
        </a>
        . This was a milestone event for everyone who supports the hospital, particularly its Medical Staff Council Chair, Dr Allan Tyson; Grafton Community Health Committee Chair, Shirley Adams; Area Health Service Advisory Council member, Sandra Woods; and Clarence Valley Mayor, Councillor Richie Williamson. The council is expected to approve the planning application within weeks. The main building works tender will be let in September 2009. Construction is due to be completed in December 2010.

        In this year’s budget there was an announcement from Minister Roxon that the government would invest in a $560 million network of state-of-the-art regional cancer centres with associated accommodation centres. I am encouraging the Lismore district’s medical fraternity and other community leaders to work with me to secure one of up to 10 such centres, enhancing the one that we have under development. We could have our PET scanner and accommodation service.
