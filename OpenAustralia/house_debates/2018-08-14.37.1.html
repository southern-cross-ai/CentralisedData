        My question is to the Prime Minister. Less than a year ago, the Prime Minister said, 'We have no plans to build a coal-fired power station.' Having no plans is one thing, but will the Prime Minister rule out spending any taxpayers' money building coal-fired power stations, yes or no?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I'm amazed the Leader of the Opposition is going to turn his back on all of those coalminers that are represented by his colleagues opposite. Apparently, they're involved in a shameful business. People who work in coal-fired power stations, according to the Leader of the Opposition, are involved in a shameful business. The Leader of the Opposition has got to get out of this ideological trap set for him by the Greens and get on the side of hardworking Australian families and ensure they have lower power bills.

         report would provide government support for any form of new firmed or dispatchable power, regardless of its technology, as long as it's not being delivered or built by one of the big gentailers. It would add to competition, greater supply and lower prices. It has been welcomed around the country. You'll see plenty of different technologies competing to receive that support, and you know what? I'll tell you whose side we're on. We're on the side of Australian families. They want to pay less for electricity, and we are the only parties in this parliament that have a plan for them to do so.
