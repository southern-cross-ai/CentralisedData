       <p>
        I rise in the House today to table a petition on behalf of the constituents of Brisbane strongly opposing the decision by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        not to reopen the Milton Business Centre. The former Milton Business Centre, along with many neighbouring businesses, was devastated by the January 2011 floods. Unlike the other small businesses in the area, the Milton Post Office has not reopened its doors. This is an additional slap in the face to local residents, families and small businesses who are still struggling to rebuild after the devastating floods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses in Milton rely heavily on the proximity of this post office to conduct their daily business activities and many businesses have had to spend money reprinting letterheads and business cards, installing letterboxes in their buildings and soaking up the cost of travelling up to 40 minutes on a daily basis to collect packages and check their post office boxes at other centres across Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite my representation to the Minister for Broadband, Communication and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        , the decisions seems to have now been made and the minister has refused to intervene or come up with an additional practical solution. I call on the minister to consider these families and businesses.

         The petition read as follows—

        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives

       <p class="italic">
        This petition of the undersigned Citizens of Queensland
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        draws to the attention of the House: Australia Post is planning to close the Australia Post Business Centre at 37 Douglas Street Milton, Queensland. We believe the decision not to reopen in the Milton business district will cause great inconvenience for local families and business owners rebuilding after the recent flood devastation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to: Seek assurances from Australia Post that they will commit to re-opening a full Australia Post Business Centre facility in the Milton business and shopping precinct.
