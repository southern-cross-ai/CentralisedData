       <p>
        Homelessness is an issue that touches many lives, and it is a sad fact that thousands of people are on our streets each night. There are too many people who do not have a place to call home. Homelessness occurs for a number of reasons, including a shortage of affordable housing, long-term unemployment, mental health issues, domestic violence, substance abuse and family and relationship breakdowns. Youth homelessness is one of the major problems facing our communities, with statistics showing that almost half of homeless people are less than 24 years of age. This is concerning given the susceptibility of this age group to such things as alcohol and drug abuse, violence and gambling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to speak about two organisations in my electorate that have made it their job to do something positive about the plight of the homeless in our community. I have the privilege of witnessing firsthand the work of the Liverpool Community Kitchen and Hub and the Liverpool Youth Accommodation Assistance Company. The Liverpool Community Kitchen was officially launched in August this year and provides breakfast and lunch to approximately 70 people per day, three days a week. It offers cooked and continental breakfasts, lunches and desserts.
       </p>
       <p>
        This centre is a joint partnership of Anglicare Liverpool, Cabramatta Community Centre, Inspire Community Services, the

        and Parramatta Mission. The centre not only provides a decent meal but also acts as a referral centre for such things as drug and alcohol abuse, emergency housing, clothing and other areas of concern to people. Each week approximately 200 people visit the Liverpool Community Kitchen and the centre relies heavily on local donations. The Liverpool community kitchen also hosts work placement students, providing them with much-needed experience as they go about their task of seeking jobs. This is another truly good thing occurring within our community.

        Very early on, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Inspire Community Services, Mike Meyer, recognised the need for this form of local service and the kitchen is affectionately known as his baby. For his foresight and persistence I certainly congratulate him. The team of workers from Anglicare, the Cabramatta Community Centre, the council, the Uniting Church, Mission Australia and Parramatta Mission should also be congratulated, as well as the army of volunteers who freely give of their time each week to help others. It would be remiss of me not to also mention the work and dedication of the centre's manager, Steve Lytton, who truly makes the kitchen and the hub run very efficiently. I congratulate him and his team.

        At another organisation I recently visited Elizabeth Milinkovic, a living skills worker at the Liverpool Youth Accommodation Assistance Company, who has brought my attention to the number of young people who are homeless in our region. LYAAC is a non-profit public company that provides accommodation and support for people between the ages of 16 and 25 who are either homeless or at risk of being homeless. The company was formed back in 1984 and it is currently managed by a board of six volunteer directors, accommodating up to 40 young people and their dependent children. They have been working alongside young people to assist them in making changes in their lives by running intensive casework, social and educational workshops. LYAAC provides access to health professionals, tutoring, employment coaching and mentoring projects and helps encourage social interactions and increase job readiness and job opportunities for these young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        LYAAC's core funding is provided through the Specialist Homelessness Services program and through other charitable organisations including the Sydney Women's Fund and Clubs New South Wales. I would particularly like to mention the good work and contribution to this wonderful organisation made by Mounties. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ms Milinkovic and Mr Derek Tweed for their efforts in giving homeless youths another chance in our community. We need to understand more about homelessness and the resources available. We know that homelessness is not just an issue of finance. There are many things that we need to do. On behalf of a grateful community, I thank both of these organisations.
