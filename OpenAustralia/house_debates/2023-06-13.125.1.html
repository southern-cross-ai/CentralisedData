        It gives me great pleasure to rise in this place to celebrate some wonderful Boothby constituents who were recognised yesterday in the King's Birthday honours. These honours are Australia's way of saying thanks to those who make significant contributions to our communities, and how lucky we are in Boothby to have so many engaged community members who selflessly contribute to our community in so many different ways. To these people and to everyone in Boothby who volunteers and works tirelessly to better our community we say thank you. The first two were appointed Members of the Order of Australia:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Fox" rel="nofollow">
         Rodney Fox
        </a>
        for significant service to tourism and to shark biology and Distinguished Professor Justine Smith for significant service to ophthalmology, particularly in research and education. The following received the

        for service to the community through a range of roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge those that were recognised for other meritorious awards for their service to Boothby and the wider Australian community: Senior sergeant Kelly-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Anne Taylor
        </a>
        who was awarded the

         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        ; Dr Jonathan Gorvett, who was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for outstanding public service in emergency management and intergovernmental relations; and Dr Kathleen Ophel-Keller for outstanding public service to the agricultural industry through research and innovative leadership.
       </p>

         The Order

        of Australia and the other meritorious awards honour those Australians who go above and beyond to contribute to their communities. In 2023, we had 1,192 Australians named in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         King's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        List. For the first time, more than 50 per cent were women. I would encourage everyone, if there is someone you know who are a valued leader in their field or in their community—I know we all know many of them in Boothby—to nominate that person for recognition in the Order of Australia this coming year.
