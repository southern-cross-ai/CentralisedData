        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the facts that, firstly, the economy is now shrinking; secondly, the government is pushing ahead blindly with changes in industrial relations; and, thirdly, the government is pushing ahead with a flawed emissions trading system. I ask you, Prime Minister: how can you expect business to keep people in jobs when the risk of a Rudd recession is coming from three different directions?

          Work Choices
         </a>
         , for his question. What I can say about the impact of a global recession is that the last thing Australian workers want now is the reintroduction of Work Choices. There the Liberal Party stand, led by the member for North Sydney, saying that what working families across Australia want now is Work Choices—Work Choices, which strips away redundancy payments; Work Choices, which strips away penalty rates; Work Choices, which strips away overtime; Work Choices, which strips away basic protections in the workplace. In a time of global recession, the free market fundamentalists opposite say that their solution for the future is to rip and tear away at the protections for Australians in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government’s strategy is clear. We will implement an economic stimulus strategy in order to reduce the impact of the global recession on Australian jobs. That is the government’s plan. That is the government’s strategy. That is what we are getting on with doing. I say this to the member for North Sydney: it is very easy to sit there and carp and be negative. It is very easy to tear down and not to build up—

               I am not going to repeat what he said, but he referred to the member by his title and then added something to it. It was title plus, all right? As I have indicated, I would hope that at some stage the House might address some of the matters to do with question time. What is happening here is permissible under the present standing orders, and the Prime Minister has the call.

                 Work Choices
                </a>
                for his contribution to the debate. What is a live concern for everyone in the nation is when they will seek to bring Work Choices back, because Work Choices is in the Liberal Party

               <p>
                Let us go to the three elements of the position put forward by the member for North Sydney in his question. The first is on economic stimulus. What they said when we introduced the economic stimulus plan was, ‘We, the Liberal Party, support it.’ Secondly, on the abolition of Work Choices what they have said is that Work Choices is dead. Thirdly, on the question of the emissions trading scheme, what did we have from the member for Flinders? When it came out in July last year, what did the member for Flinders say? He said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Basically, what they’ve done—
               </p>
               <p>
                that is, the government—
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                is they’ve dusted off the document that we had.
               </p>
               <p>
                There you have those opposite saying that there is nothing different between them and us on emissions trading, saying that Work Choices is dead, supporting our economic strategy and trying to argue that somehow they have a credible basis on which to enter this debate today. Consistency, Joe, will help every day.

                 <p>
                  I thank the honourable member for her question. Data from the United States overnight continues to confirm the impact of the global recession on its national economy. In the month of February, industrial production in the United States fell a further 1.4 per cent, taking production down to its lowest level in seven years. Capacity utilisation in the United States has now fallen to 70.9 per cent, down from 71.9 per cent in January. This is now equal to the lowest capacity utilisation level in the United States ever recorded.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Beyond the United States, we have received further confirmation of the way this global economic cyclone is hitting economies around the world. Canada has recorded a sharp jump in unemployment from 7.2 per cent to 7.7 per cent, and Italy has seen a fall in

                  of 1.9 per cent in the December quarter, its largest fall since contemporary records began in 1981. In Singapore, the largest fall in retail sales in a decade was recorded in January, with retail sales down by 12.2 per cent compared with last year. What these figures from the United States, from Canada, from Italy and from Singapore demonstrate is that this global recession is affecting every national economy. The key question within each national economy is, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ That is why the government has put forward its economic stimulus plan for the future, which is, firstly, based on us providing guarantees for bank deposits in order to underpin confidence in the Australia financial system; secondly, based on what we are also doing with support payments to pensioners, to carers, to veterans and to farmers in hardship, which will support the 1½ million Australians employed in the retail sector; and, thirdly, based on our investment in long-term infrastructure—our school modernisation plan as well as what we are doing in social housing and energy insulation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On the impact of the stimulus package—and I noticed those opposite are no longer asking us about the effect of the economic stimulus package—I draw the attention of those opposite to the minutes of the 3 March

                    The chortling member for Aston might listen to this, as he was asking questions yesterday about the impact of the stimulus on activity in the economy. The
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">

                    minutes say:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    … retail spending had increased sharply in December, after a run of weak readings in previous months … the higher level of December sales was maintained in January, with sales rising by a further 0.2 per cent.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Further, the RBA attributed this rise to increases in household disposable income which were driven by ‘lower lending interest rates, lower petrol prices and government transfer payments’. Moreover, the RBA noted that the government’s second stimulus would provide further support for the economy. It went on to say:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    Looking at government finances, the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ’s fiscal package announced in February would provide significant stimulus to the economy over the next two years.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That is from the Reserve Bank Board’s meeting of 3 March. That goes to the heart of the relationship between the government’s economic stimulus strategy and its impact on economic activity in Australia across the period ahead.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The response to what the government has done is reflected by comments not just by a number of large retailers but also by small business operators in Australia. I note that support is coming in from Mildura, in the member for Mallee’s electorate. Rob

                    in Mildura said, ‘We have doubled our sales since Thursday and made $2,000 more than we did before Christmas.’ Then you have Office Works in Mildura saying, ‘March typically is a tough month in Mildura, but it is very encouraging and I think retail in general in Mildura is doing okay.’ There will be different reports from different parts of the country over time. What I find interesting in the baying and howling from those opposite, though, is that they do not like any good news. You know why? Because they celebrate bad news. That is because they seek to take political advantage out of bad news. We are getting on with the business of providing an economic response to the global economic crisis; they continue in their attempt to take political advantage from the economic crisis.

                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday in a question that was asked by the member for Ryan you asked him to vouch for the statements that he was seeking to repeat in question time. I hope you will ask the Prime Minister to vouch for the efficacy of the ones that he has read out.

                               I think that all members might, if they open their ears and do not chatter away, understand that I am talking to all of you, whilst my comments might be directed to the member for Sturt. But sometimes some people seem to be above all this. The member for Sturt probably only has very limited ways of being able to do this, but he might explore the standing orders to find out if there is a way that he can find a space within the pro-ceedings of the parliament to make a response.

                                   . I think that in indulgence I have actually been very fair in giving both sides the same amount of indulgence. That is not one of the mechanisms that I thought might be possible for the member for Sturt. The Prime Minister has the call.

                                           is feigning the type of forgetfulness that is advantageous to him at the moment. I just wish to illustrate so we can get back on with question time, because I am sure that the people of Australia would prefer to be having question time rather than this very intense discussion about practices in the standing orders of this place. The fact is that these types of rhetorical questions have been used. Rhetorical questions suggest debate. This is something that has been addressed by this House over many, many, many parliaments. If the opposition have some problem with it, they might take this up with the procedure committee.

                                            I take it, at least from the member for Sturt’s vote in this House, that he does oppose every single grant to every primary school in his electorate of Sturt. In the absence of him saying no, I assume that is the case. I have referred to the impact in terms of retailers in Mildura, but also I would refer to what some major retailers have had to say most recently about the impact of the government’s economic stimu-lus strategy. For example, Big W has seen a very positive sales trend.

                                            … certainly resonated very strongly in Big W as families stocked up on everyday general merchandise such as kids clothing.

                                            What you have, therefore, is a stimulus felt by smaller retailers, by larger retailers and also, of course, by the range of measures which have gone into the housing sector, as the Minister for Housing has referred to at the dispatch box before. These measures to provide for payments to families, to carers, to pensioners and to veterans are all designed to support stimulus for the 1½ million jobs in the Australian retail sector, which those opposite do not care about.

We are also investing in order to make Australian homes energy efficient by installing ceiling insulation in 2.7 million Australian homes. The government are investing in building 20,000 new units of social housing. The government are investing $1.2 billion in the

                                            infrastructure. The government’s strategy is clear cut: an economic stimulus plan to support jobs now and to build the infrastructure Australia needs for the future. What we have instead from those opposite is a political strategy of ‘wait and see and do nothing; hope it gets better’ to take political advantage out of the global economic recession. We, the govern-ment, are getting on with the job.
