        I rise this afternoon to speak about a very important issue in my electorateâ€”that is, access to the M5 on-ramps at Riverwood. Nearly 20 years ago, the M5 was constructed. At Riverwood it was constructed in such a way that you could enter and exit the M5 if you were travelling in a westerly direction but you could not in an easterly direction and that remains the case today some two decades later. The space is there to open the ramps. It is very frustrating as you drive past and you see the space where the ramps could be opened to allow people access to the city and from the city and it is my very strong view that these ramps should be opened.
       </p>

        Recently, the state government conducted an investigation into the means by which this could be done, the engineering works and so on that would be required. I would very much welcome the conclusion of that process. I look forward to further discussions with the state government. I believe the federal government should support this project. We have to open those M5 ramps at Riverwood. It is something I am very committed to. I look forward to further discussions on this important issue.
