        It was a real pleasure to attend a post-flood gathering in Chelmer with local residents and some of the services that did such a great job responding to the flood disaster in March. The gathering was at Toco Italiano restaurant, in Oxley Road, a very popular local Italian restaurant run by Arturo and Mahoney, both very generous people. Despite Arturo and Mahoney having their own home flooded, they and their staff did a wonderful job firing up the pizzas for locals, people that were flooded, people that had their power cut during the March flood. The pizzas were provided for free, and Arturo, Mahoney and their staff provided a wonderful beacon of kindness in our damaged community.

        This fundraiser and appreciation event was organised by Arturo and Graceville local Martin Finbow. It was a great afternoon catching up with everyone over some delicious food. Certificates of appreciation were handed out by local Senior Sergeant Mick Coulson to representatives from the Army, Energex, the Queensland fire service, and, of course, our wonderful friends at Toco Italiano. And the local children were very impressed with the fire truck.

        It's easy to forget that there are many in the Moreton community who are still not back in their houses. All are now without flood insurance. The floods this year were a tough and stressful time for so many, but people across my electorate, like Arturo and the staff at Toco Italiano, rose to the task. They supported family and friends and strangers, and did so much to help and comfort others. Thank you Arturo and Mahoney and all of your staff.
