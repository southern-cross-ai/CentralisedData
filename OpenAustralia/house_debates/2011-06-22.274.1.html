        My question is to the member for Makin in his capacity as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        , Environment and the Arts. Has the committee he chairs been requested by the government, or does it intend to ask the government for a reference, to inquire into the regional employment effects of a carbon tax?

         Order! The Leader of the House and the Chief Government Whip can resume their places. Yesterday I was referred to page 536 of
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         by those who pleaded the case for the question by the Leader of the Nationals. I should have learnt my lesson earlier on other subjects and read either page 535 or page 537 at that time. Honourable members who want to pursue this line of questioning should read on beyond page 536 to page 537, where they will see the reasons that, I think, are very important in ruling this question out.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While I respect your ruling in relation to this question, I would make the following points: (1) there are precedents for this question going over many decades; (2) previous Speakers have allowed such questions in the past; and (3) there is no argument, no debate in this question—it is a completely straight question to the chair, as you are well aware. So I take it from what you have just said that you have decided, as the Speaker in this parliament, that no such questions will be allowed.

          </small>
          <p>
           All I am saying is that there are plenty of precedents where questions of this ilk have not been allowed. It has been acknowledged that there is a narrow window of opportunity to ask other members questions about matters for which they are responsible. One of the overarching reasons for my decision, which I believe is important, is that if the member for Sturt were to read page 537 he would understand that it would be inappropriate, given the conventions of the way in which we conduct our committee system, for a chair—even if there had been discussions—to report matters not previously reported to the chamber and to do so without discussing it with the committee. That is the point that is clearly made on page 537.

           <p>
            Mr Speaker, on the point of order: this is an important threshold question for this parliament, and obviously, having been here for some time, I have not just read one page of
            <i>
             Practice
            </i>
            . I would point out to you that there could be nothing narrower than asking whether a chair has been requested by the government or intends to seek a reference, but I take it from what you have said that you have decided that chairs will not be asked such questions. While we abide by your ruling, it is out of step with the precedent that was established in 1957. But you are the Speaker and we accept your decision.

            <p>
             I am happy to be reminded of precedents right back to Federation. That is okay. It is clearly outlined in
             <i>
              Practice
             </i>
             that there are many situations where from time to time there are rulings that would appear to be inconsistent with other rulings. What I have indicated is that I will attempt to be consistent. To the extent that I am being consistent today with my ruling of yesterday, I think that gives guidance to the member for Sturt.
