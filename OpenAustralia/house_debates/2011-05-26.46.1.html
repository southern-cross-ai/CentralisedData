       <p>
        I would like put on record, in light of recent inaccurate comments in this House and in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        media, my absolute support for the long-awaited F3 to M2 link, and I record the support of my fellow Central Coast federal Labor colleagues, the members for Dobell and Shortland. Regrettably, after years of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government inaction, federal funding for $150 million for a feasibility study for the link had to be deferred in this year's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        In their comments on the F3—which experienced another extensive delay this week further up the road, south of the Hawkesbury—members opposite have neglected to say that this project is in a position where it can only proceed with the support of the New South Wales state Liberal government. That is because it involves upgrading the state, not the national, road network. We are in limbo because the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">
         O'Farrell
        </a>
        government is yet to determine its infrastructure priorities for Sydney, which the Premier says will be based on the advice from his yet-to-be-established Infrastructure New South Wales body.
       </p>
       <p>
        I bring to the attention of the House comments made by the New South Wales Roads Minister for Roads and Ports,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Gay" rel="nofollow">
         Duncan Gay
        </a>
        , earlier this month. He told state parliament:

        made it clear before the election that we will commence construction on one of the key missing links in the Sydney orbital road … Infrastructure New South Wales will determine whether the first missing link for construction will be the F3-M2 link, the M5 East duplication, the

        </a>
        extension or the F6.
       </p>
       <p>
        So which one will it be? As the federal government has explained to anyone who cares to listen, we have directed

        to get on with the job.
       </p>
       <p>
        $150 million in planning money was committed and will be just deferred depending on the O'Farrell government. Let us not play the blame game; it is time to get on with the job—
