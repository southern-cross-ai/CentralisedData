        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Armoured Fighting Vehicles Facilities Program—Stage 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to provide fit-for-purpose facilities and infrastructure to support and train Army personnel on the next generation of armoured fighting vehicle capability being procured for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . The project is the first stage of several proposed stages to deliver facilities under a rolling program of work. The project proposes to deliver works at the Puckapunyal military area in Victoria, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Lavarack Barracks
        </a>
        Queensland and the Edinburgh Defence Precinct South Australia in support of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Capability Program. Under this program, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        will replace its current fleet of armoured fighting vehicle platforms over the next decade and acquire a new armoured engineering capability. The proposed works are within the Defence estate and will bring economic stimulus to the three locations around Australia, with expected employment opportunities for local subcontractors. The proposed works will comply with the relevant standards and regulations. The estimated cost of the works is $235.1 million, including Defence contingency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWC" rel="nofollow">
         PWC
        </a>
        on 27 November 2019. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction activities are expected to commence in mid-2020 and be completed by 2023.

       <p>
        The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is proposing to undertake works at the National Education Centre for the Great Barrier Reef's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_HQ" rel="nofollow">
         Reef HQ

        Aquarium. Reef HQ was opened in 1987 as a bicentennial community project to create a living example of a coral reef on land to showcase science and to deliver education about marine science, heritage and other reef values. The proposed works will address identified safety and operational concerns associated with Reef HQ's ageing infrastructure in order to allow for the facility's continued safe operation. This, in turn, will allow for the continued provision of educational and informational services to the wider community. The estimated cost of the works, to be undertaken over four years from 2019-20, is $26.9 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , with ongoing funding of $1.8 million from 2023-24 for critical capital works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the PWC on 19 February 2020 and the committee made two recommendations: (a) that Reef HQ is provided with additional funding for the purposes of updating its exhibits and technology to enable it to maintain its excellence in education, research and tourism; and (b) that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction activities are expected to commence in mid-2020 and to be completed by mid-2023.
