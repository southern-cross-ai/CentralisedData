        My question is to the minister for the environment. Minister, I ask this question when only moments ago the spot price for electricity in South Australia was approaching 50 times the cost of electricity in Victoria. I ask the minister about a retail business in my electorate in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        . This business has seen an increase in the cost of its electricity bill for one month alone of $18,000. Minister, can you update the House on what action the government is taking to ensure Australians have access to affordable and reliable power?

         I thank the member for Barker for his question and acknowledge his deep concern for the rising electricity prices for those in his electorate, including the irrigators, the almond growers, the sawmill at Glencoe and, indeed, the fast food operators at Naracoorte and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Gambier
         </a>
         who have seen their electricity prices each go up by more than $90,000 over the last year. When those opposite talk about jobs, spare a thought for those young people, or those parents coming back into the workforce after having kids, who will be denied a job because those businesses cannot afford to pay their own electricity bills.

         That is why the Prime Minister is focused on getting stability and security in our electricity system. That is why he called in the

         <i>
          The Australian

         newspaper has 'a jihad against renewables'. In a press conference today, the Premier of South Australia was asked about the warning back in 2009 that it was damaging to go above 20 per cent renewables. The question to the Premier was: 'You were warned that you were going beyond 20 per cent for renewables and that was going to destabilise the grid. What do you say, Premier of South Australia?' He said, 'The evidence is that it hasn't.'

           Under standing order 100 and the requirement for authentication, we heard in the question about it being, I think, 50 times. Given the spot price is nowhere near 50 times right at this moment, could he either table his calculator or table the document that he was basing it on?
