         I thank the member for Moore for his question and very strong support for the global fight against terrorism and the support of democracy in Iraq. Yesterday the nationally democratically elected

          Prime Minister of Iraq
         </a>
         made an announcement which represents a significant milestone in the move towards democracy in Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki announced that the first province in Iraq which will transfer entirely to provincial Iraqi control will be that of

          C130 Hercules

         and a variety of other important roles in Baghdad, including security. We have had 460 soldiers protecting some 600 Japanese engineers in the Al Muthanna province. Over that time our soldiers have done us proud. They have trained around 1,650 Iraqi army soldiers of the 2nd Brigade of the National Iraqi Army. They have also supported a number of very important projects. The member for Moore in particular will be interested in the mobile health clinic. There have also been veterinary clinics, water purification, the restoration of a community centre, the refurbishment of bus stations, the development of an ambulance station, the reconnection of electricity and a whole variety of very important tasks.

Should the Japanese government announce that it will be withdrawing its engineers then the Australian government will redeploy our 460 soldiers to Tallil, which is an American air base just north of the Al Muthanna-

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a very serious and significant step, and really it ought to be done with a proper parliamentary statement that parliament can then discuss. You do not make a complete change to the role of Australian defence forces like this without that parliamentary statement. Every time there has been a commitment like this, that has been the case. Frankly, it is a disservice to the troops to make the announcement—

The Leader of the Opposition would be aware that it is not for the occupant of the chair to make that decision. There are other forms, if he feels strongly about it. The minister is in order.

            </a>
            provide training from the air base in Tallil. They will also provide further training in support of border protection to the Iraqi security forces in the southern part of Iraq. In addition to that, if the Iraqi security forces, under the direction of the democratically elected Iraqi national government and the provincial government of Al Muthanna, require it, and if the legal, administrative and military arrangements are to the satisfaction of the Australian government, we will provide in extremis support to the Iraqi security forces. This is a very important step and an important milestone in the move to the democratically governed country of Iraq. We are very proud of what our soldiers have done. This job is associated with risk because it is an important job. We are very proud of them and we look forward to further progress in Iraq.

            <p>
             My question is to the Minister for Defence. Is it the case that the government has characterised Australia’s participation in the war in Iraq as being for, firstly, the search for weapons of mass destruction, then regime change, then protecting the Japanese and now a fourth phase of security overwatch? What intelligence assessments have been made of any additional risks that will be faced by our troops undertaking this new role? Given that it appears the British and Italians are scaling back their involvement in the region, what will be done to ensure our troops have adequate backup, including helicopter and artillery support and, if necessary, medical evacuation capability?

                     As was foreshadowed some months ago, the progress in Iraq is that, having had a democratically elected Iraqi government, where 12 million Iraqis at risk to their lives voted on three occasions, the process in Iraq is to move to provincial Iraqi control. What that means is that the coalition, working with the Iraqi government, including the provincial government, has been working with the British forces, the Iraqi forces and all of those who are in Iraq to negotiate the arrangements under which the Iraqi people will govern themselves and be responsible for their own security. Of course there has been a detailed intelligence and risk assessment undertaken of this, and the Leader of the Opposition of all people should know that under no circumstances do we discuss intelligence issues in a public arena.
