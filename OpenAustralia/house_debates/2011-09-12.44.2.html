       <p>
        Before question time today, the House is going to engage in some reflections on the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 9-11. Last night I and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as a large number of others from the parliament, gathered for a commemoration of that event. It was cold and it was wet and the mood was necessarily sombre as we reflected on the lives lost in 9-11, including 10 Australian lives, and of course the lives lost over the decades since in Bali, in London, in Mumbai and in Jakarta. There was a sombre mood of reflection and a sombre mood of grief, but there was something else there last night apart from that sombre mood of reflection. I detected defiance and I detected resolve. People joined together because they wanted to say: 'Even as we mourn what we have lost, we are defiant and we will continue to live our lives in freedom. We are resolved to do everything necessary to ensure that we continue to live those lives in freedom.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night at the same event I received, in person from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Ambassador" rel="nofollow">
         US Ambassador
        </a>
        , a letter to me as Prime Minister from the President of the United States,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        . They are words of reflection for all of the Australian people. It is my intention to table in the House today a copy of the letter I received last night. President Obama reminded us of Prime Minister Howard's presence in Washington on that fateful day and how important his words of comfort were to the American people. President Obama said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's quick declaration that these attacks were an assault on the values and freedoms shared by our two countries comforted us; your invocation of Article
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
         ANZUS
        </a>
        Treaty strengthened our resolve to prevail over this menace. Americans were moved by the expressions of sympathy from so many Australian citizens, and we shared your grief at the loss of ... Australians in the September 11 attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Obama went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the decade since the attacks, we have had no more steadfast partner than Australia in our effort to defeat terrorists in Afghanistan, in Bali, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        and in Southeast Asia. Australia's robust cooperation in these efforts has made a tremendous contribution to achieving the alliance goals we share, and has won the lasting affection and gratitude of Americans.
       </p>
       <p>
        I bring those words to the House because I believe they are important words of reflection on the bond between us and our friends in the United States of America. They are also important words of reflection on our shared resolve to keep combating terrorism in Afghanistan, ensuring that it is no longer a safe haven for terrorists and doing what we need to do in this country to keep our people safe and secure. I table the letter.

        <p>
         The 11 September 2001 atrocity was not just an attack on America; it was an attack on civilisation everywhere. On that day America was under attack not because of its faults but because of its virtues—because of its democracy, because of its pluralism, because of its diversity and because of its decency. America was under attack on that day because of the respect it accorded to women, to minorities, to different religions and to people who challenge social norms. Since September 11, America and its allies have made some mistakes—how could we not?—but we have not surrendered the values that made our civilisation a target. Most importantly, we have appreciated that, though the terrorists acted in the name of religion, our enemy was not religion; it was terrorism—it was not Islam; it was extremism. We never made the mistake of thinking that Islam was incompatible with democratic pluralism or blamed all Muslims for the madness of a few. It is this good sense and insight which has enabled the pluralist civilisation to flourish through the war on terror.
        </p>
        <p>
         I venture the hope that the values that were under attack that day, the values we uphold now and the values we will always uphold are not just Western values but universal ones. They are the better angels of all people and all cultures. I close with an example of the magnanimity of which all peoples and all cultures are capable. When Tariq Jahan lost his son, who was senselessly murdered by rioters in Birmingham last month, he did not react by calling for vengeance. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … I don't blame the government. I don't blame the police. I don't blame anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is not a race issue. The family has received messages of support from all parts of society. I lost my son. Blacks, Asians, whites—we all live in the same community.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was a marvellous message from a true Muslim, a true Briton and a true member of the civilised world. We all live in the same world. Yes, we must confront evil. We must be defiant in the face of evil, of course. We must be resolute in the face of evil, but we must be generous too and we must seek everywhere the sparks of common humanity if we are to make our world whole and safe.
