       <p>
        This time of year is a special time in my community as we celebrate the achievements of so many wonderful people with the Lalor Heroes awards. 2021 was a tough year for many in our community, but, like always, we came together to help one another in our times of need. The Lalor Heroes for 2021 have cooked, provided meals, run sporting clubs, run social media to keep people connected, helped roll out the vaccine locally, assisted families in their schools and answered the calls to grassroots action in a really tough year. Congratulations and thank you to all of the winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's at this time of year also that we celebrate our student leaders for their commitment to improving their school community. Whether it's in official student leadership roles or it's academic excellence, peer support or a drive to make our community a better place, I want to congratulate the 2021 Julia Gillard Award winners and the school Lalor Heroes award recipients. They're already extraordinary students, but what they've done in the face of the pandemic and the pressures it has placed on them in the last two years just shows what special people their families and our schools have produced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, as this is more than likely the last time I'll speak in the House before we rise for the year, I want to take the opportunity to wish all members a Merry Christmas and a safe summer. And to everyone whom I represent in the parliament: have a Merry Christmas, enjoy the time with family and friends, stay safe and have a happy
