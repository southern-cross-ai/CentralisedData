        It is my honour to rise today to recognise the president of the Rosebud

        , who was celebrated and awarded life membership of the club in a beautiful ceremony last Friday night. Bruce has had a long and fruitful association with the Rosebud RSL sub-branch, becoming a member of the committee as far back as in 1987 and then of the executive, as vice president, for 10 years. In that time Bruce has engineered enormous changes for the RSL, encouraging a professional committee culture underpinned by the principles of good governance. These are crucial developments for a club which professionally navigates its way through a dynamic environment down on the southern

        and delivers great value to its members and to visitors alike, particularly after such a long and enduring COVID period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of Bruce's great achievements include $7 million that has been reinvested into improving the club's facilities, $6 million in refurbishments and $5 million to veterans and the community. This has all been achieved while maintaining a positive balance sheet. He has also developed innovative ways to support the community and build memberships and overseen improvements in the club's food quality—which I can attest was absolutely delicious last Friday night—which is now a core competency and point of difference from the competition. It recently saw the club get a number of awards, including for Bruce as club man of the year. Bruce has been instrumental in procuring entertainers for the club's demographic as well as for special commemoration events, particularly Anzac Day, which is such an important day down on the peninsula. Well done, Bruce. It was great to be there to celebrate you.
