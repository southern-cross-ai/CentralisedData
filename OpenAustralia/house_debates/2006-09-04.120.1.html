       <p>
        To the thousands of people in the eastern suburbs, one of the biggest causes of concern is traffic and road congestion. It has been the source of much complaint for the entire 10 years that I have been in office. Notwithstanding the highlighting of the Scoresby issue from time to time in this House, there is another issue which people need to be aware of. Recently, I was pleased to inform my electorate that the federal government has offered $25 million to upgrade one of Melbourne’s most congested hot spots. Roads and transport are key issues in Deakin. While the Bracks Labor government has lied to people of the east on tolls, there are other prominent issues in the eastern suburbs, and this federal coalition government is taking a stand and saying that we are prepared to address one of the worst traffic black spots in the entire state of Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The intersection of Springvale and Whitehorse roads in Nunawading, compounded by the rail level crossing only 100 metres away, results in serious traffic congestion at the junction of two of Melbourne’s major arterials. The need for action on this intersection is pressing. These roads will act as feeders for the Scoresby-Frankston road currently under construction. If this situation is not addressed properly by the Bracks government it will continue to worsen.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has already been a lot of money poured into that intersection by the federal and state governments but there is an urgent need to address the problem in a more sustainable way.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springvale_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Springvale Road
        </a>
        is one of Melbourne’s major north-south thoroughfares, used by approximately 125,000 vehicles per day. Whitehorse Road, travelling east-west, connects the city and inner east with the outer eastern suburbs. The area is experiencing continued growth in population and demand for services. It is time that the Victorian Labor government acknowledged the problems that their disastrous 2030 planning policy has created and will continue to create.
       </p>
       <p>
        The level crossing, less than 100 metres from this intersection, services the two main eastern railway lines and accounts for 250 passenger trains a day. Springvale Road and the railway line clearly need to be separated. To their credit, the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehorse_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Whitehorse City Council
        </a>
        has recognised the importance of this and has conducted a study of grade separation at the site. It will contribute $30,000 of its own money to a preliminary engineering study. I was pleased to see the local mayor, Councillor Sharon Ellis, welcome the federal government announcement with open arms. She and her fellow councillors realise what the Bracks government has been doing to the people of the east through their neglect.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has taken a lead role in addressing this issue by announcing funds for not only the project and whatever the community decides is most appropriate but also an extended feasibility study to determine the most appropriate course of action. In fact, $1.5 million is available right now for the Whitehorse City Council to commence its engineering study. Contrary to what the Mr Batchelor may say, this is not a stunt. This is $25 million of federal taxpayers’ money that is able to be spent on fixing one of Melbourne’s worst traffic congestion and black spots. Yet the Bracks government and Mr Batchelor seem to be totally committed to rejecting offers of a federal contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Victorian government has been sorely lacking in the last seven years a commitment to the quality of life for the people of Melbourne’s outer east. I say to the state transport minister: acknowledge your years of neglect, acknowledge that there is a viable and sustainable solution to this problem and promise the people of Deakin, Casey, Aston,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        and Menzies that you will help ease the burden they feel every day on their way to and from work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since writing to the electorate and the affected suburbs on the federal government’s contribution, I have been inundated with letters of support from residents. Each one of them has shown absolute amazement at Mr Batchelor’s response in claiming that this is a stunt. One person who sent me an email today has basically said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The response of the Bracks government, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Batchelor" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Batchelor
        </a>
        in particular, highlights the contempt they have for the eastern suburbs. Remembering Batchelor’s work in the 1984 Nunawading by-election scandal, their do-nothing attitude is endemic of a government in decline, that is becoming lazy and has simply run out of ideas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to the Bracks government making a funding commitment to the Springvale Road. They are funding an intersection down the road at a level crossing at Middleborough Road. There is no question about it; all level crossings need to be eliminated. But when you have $25 million of federal government funding, why would you turn your back on that kind of contribution? I say: address the issues, start the work on the engineering study today and acknowledge your failings.
