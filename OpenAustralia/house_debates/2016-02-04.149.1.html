       <p>
        This morning we have seen the kind of 'respectful' debate that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        's completely unnecessary $160 million marriage equality plebiscite will bring to Australia. This image, which is a photoshopped rainbow noose around the neck of a woman, is crap produced by a group called the Australian Marriage Alliance, which describes itself as an 'Independent alliance bringing together individuals and organisations supporting a common cause that is opposing marriage equality.' While the Australian Marriage Alliance claims to speak for mainstream Australia or the silent majority, it will not disclose who funds it or who is a member of it. This is a group that regularly quotes data opposing marriage equality but refuses to disclose sources for this data. It is a group that recently accused marriage equality advocates of 'exploiting' the death of a married gay man, David Bulmer-Rizzi, for 'political purposes' by objecting to the fact that Mr Bulmer-Rizzi's widower was not recognised as his husband on his death certificate under Australian law. Understandably, Mr Bulmer-Rizzi took objection to this hurtful travesty that was inflicted on him in this time of mourning, yet the Australian Marriage Alliance was pointing out this injustice was 'emotional manipulation'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite their bleating, these groups do not want a debate. A debate implies that there are people who are willing to change their minds, but, as we have seen through the comments of senators Abetz, Bernardi and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
         McKenzie
        </a>
        in recent times, not even an overwhelming majority resolved in favour of marriage equality at the plebiscite will change their minds or their votes. They have made it clear their position is not for moving. Indeed, BuzzFeed News has contacted the Australian Marriage Alliance 18 times to request an interview, without response.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is only a tiny minority of the Australian public that hold these bigoted views against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTI
        </a>
        Australians, but, by committing to a national plebiscite on this issue, Malcolm Turnbull will be giving them a megaphone. The opponents of marriage equality are demanding that both sides of the marriage equality issue be provided with taxpayer funding to make their case to the Australian public. This means that Malcolm Turnbull—the new Prime Minister, not the old Prime Minister—will be writing cheques to the kinds of groups who photoshop rainbow nooses over stock photos.

          He will be writing cheques to the kinds of groups who produce television ads telling
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
           LGBTI
          </a>
          Australians that they are flawed parents who will damage their children. He will be writing cheques to the groups that will install billboards telling LGBTI teenagers that the love they feel and the relationships that they enter into are inferior to heterosexual love and not deserving of recognition from the society in which they live.

          You can understand why the former Prime Minister,

           Tony Abbott

          , wanted this. After all, the former Prime Minister was comfortable with groups like the Australian Marriage Alliance. He recently told the

          write them a cheque? Because it is easier than showing leadership in his party.
