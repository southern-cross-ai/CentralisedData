        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . How is the Albanese Labor government supporting Australian families and easing cost-of-living pressures? What could jeopardise this support in the future?

        <p>
         I'd like to thank the member for Calwell for her question. The Albanese government's No. 1 priority is providing cost-of-living relief for every Australian. We know that many families are under pressure, and our government is working hard to deliver meaningful relief without adding to inflation. On 1 July, 1.3 million low- and middle-income families will see their family tax benefit payment rates increase after indexation is applied. Nearly one million pensioners will also benefit from the increases to income and asset limits, meaning that they can have higher incomes and assets before their pensions are affected. In addition, income eligibility for paid parental leave will increase on 1 July, taking the family income threshold to just over $364,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regular indexation of payments and thresholds is an important part of a strong social safety net. For Australians accessing support when they need it, indexation is there to keep pace with the cost of living. Unfortunately, this view is not shared by everyone. It is unfortunate that we now have the member for Hume suggesting that, if he were Treasurer, he would cut this so-called unrestrained spending which of course includes the cost of indexing family payments. Those opposite do have a track record of letting family payments stagnate, with back-to-back indexation freezes when they were last in government, and of course they also tried to stop parents from accessing both their government and employer paid parental leave, labelling them as 'double dippers'. While those opposite will seek to deny families the payment they deserve, we will get on with the job of delivering.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as applying indexation on 1 July, that date will mark our government's historic expansion of paid parental leave. Detailed in the budget, we announced that we will pay superannuation on this leave from July next year. Superannuation on paid parental leave is a critical step to ensuring parents who take time off work after the birth or adoption of a child do not retire with less. Of course, 330,000 low- and middle-income families with dependent children will also benefit with a further 10 per cent increase to the maximum rate of rent assistanceâ€”our second consecutive increase in two budgets. When it comes to the cost of living, we're also delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer and energy bill relief to every household. It is the Albanese government that looks after families.
