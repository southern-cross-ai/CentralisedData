        Today I'd like to speak about a remarkable man who I've had the privilege of knowing for many years. For more than three decades

        -Blanasi has worked tirelessly as a member of the

        for the remote community of Wugularr, also known as Beswick. For more than half this time he has done this as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLC" rel="nofollow">

        Chair and Deputy Chair.

        Samuel has made an exceptional contribution across multiple fronts. He was a strong supporter of the Blue Mud Bay case, which was based on his mother's country in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">
         Arnhem Land
        </a>
        . This historic decision by the High Court in 2008 extended land rights to sea country covering more than 90 per cent of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        coastline. In March this year, Samuel was critical to the development of the Aboriginal Sea Company, an innovative approach to Aboriginal control and self-determination that will help deliver on the promise of the Blue Mud Bay decision. Samuel has also supported native title holders following the High Court's 2019 landmark judgement in Griffith's case based around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Timber Creek
        </a>
        that has paved the way for similar compensation claims that will include the category of cultural loss. He has worked closely with the Mirarr traditional owners and land council members in the West Arnhem region to address a number of historical wrongs associated with mining at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_Uranium_Mine" rel="nofollow">

        , the township of Jabiru and the handback half of

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On a national level, he has been instrumental to push for the reforms in the

        dialogue that preceded the National Constitutional Convention at Uluru and at the Territory level. Samuel has worked tirelessly towards a treaty in the Northern Territory. I can think of no more worthy a recipient for the Northern Territory Australian of the Year Award, and I send my heartfelt congratulations to Samuel, his family and, of course, all the members of the Northern Land Council, all 90, to whom he dedicated his award.
