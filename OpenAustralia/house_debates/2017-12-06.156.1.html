        The opposition member says stop, but I'll start! I'd like to start my address by thanking the amazing staff that I have—Millie, Pru, Ken, Laurie, Jennifer a nd Matt. I'd like to thank the clerks of the Ho use for all the work that they do on our behalf. We recognise that we can be most difficult and sometimes even boring! But thank you to the c lerks of the House , to Parliamentary Services and to our C

        support— and a special tribute to the gardeners around this amazing building that draws people from all over Australia and all over the world just to see what you do. Thank you t o the Parliamentary Library, who are such an enormous support to members such as me. Thank you to the Speaker and Speaker's panel for all the work that you do , and for being on time, supporting us and putting up with our speeches and the mayhem that we can sometimes cause you; and thank you to all of the staff of committees , with a shout-out to Clarissa Surtees especially, and her amazing staff, during my time as Chair of the Privileges Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House. W hat support they are to one another in difficult times , as we have seen. It doesn't matter which side of the House we are on, we will support each other in those things. There are times when we are divided ; but, most of the time, the things that we agree on , the things that draw us together, the things that are of value to all Australians , are things that are of value to my colleagues, and I thank them for their support. I thank t he w hips and their teams on both sides of the House , who keep this place moving and make sure that the right people are in the right place at the right time. We have one of the w hips sit ting in with us now.
       </p>

        Finally, I thank the

        and his office for their continued support around issues pertaining to my electorate in particular, and for all members bringing their concerns to the leadership of both parties and those i n the middle ground. I have a Prime Minister that has listened to me very carefully and has taken on board th e issues that are important to my constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I probably should thank my constituents ! Not only is my nature sometimes difficult, in that I don't always agree with what my constituents expect me to agree with, but I am very strong in my approach to how I represent them in this place. B ut they know one thing : even though they may disagree with me, when the time comes that they need support, they'll get it from me. So , this Christmas, I offer you my very sincere thoughts for a prosperous and a very healthy, very good new year. May we all come back safe and sound.
