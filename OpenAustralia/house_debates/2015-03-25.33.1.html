        I am pleased to say that the

        is really well represented in this year's National Schools Constitutional Convention, being held here in Canberra. Yesterday at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , I had the privilege of speaking with Caleb Ferry, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford High School
        </a>
        , and I also met with Liam Loader, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Grammar School
        </a>
        , in

        .

        This is the 20th edition of the convention, which started as an initiative of the Constitutional Centenary Fund. The three-day event features more than 120 students representing schools from all across Australia. They are discussing and debating various topics, such as proposals for a bill of rights, and looking at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta" rel="nofollow">
         Magna Carta
        </a>
        on its 800th anniversary. The itinerary for the convention also includes working groups, soapbox sessions and a dinner with a judge from the High Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        Caleb was telling me about how delegates will be investigating the roles of elected governments and parliaments and the responsibilities of leaders on issues such as safer streets and national security, which I know are key issues in my electorate of Robertson. He also said he is looking forward to tackling case studies from around the world, including Canada and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , and how these countries approach constitutional issues. Caleb is a 17-year-old who is passionate about politics and the law, and it was terrific to hear him talk about the benefits of interacting with other like-minded people in a place such as this one.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my hope that more young people from the Central Coast will also be selected as future representatives in future years and continue to inspire our young Central Coast leaders of the next generation.
