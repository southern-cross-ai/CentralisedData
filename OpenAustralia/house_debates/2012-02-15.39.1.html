        I rise today to talk about small school closures in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . It is a concern, less than 12 months since the New South Wales state election, that P6 schools such as the Byabarra Public School and now the Bobin Public School are under threat of closure. In the case of Byabarra, the school has actually been closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was promised that Byabarra would remain open throughout 2012, with decisions to be made at the end of this year. Unfortunately, it was closed with two weeks' notice before the end of the school year last year. Now Bobin Public School has been given until August, when it may face closure. This is being done by a government—a coalition which includes the National Party—which promised to defend small schools in New South Wales. The National Party and the government told the electorate that they understood the importance of small schools to their communities.

        and other Commonwealth programs. That money goes to waste when these P6 decisions are made. Under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Education Act
        </a>
        in New South Wales, a government can decide to close these schools whenever they want. Federal money is therefore being lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gonski review, expected to be released next week, must consider the place of small schools and disadvantaged communities as we look for a better funding model for the future. The New South Wales government and state governments generally must come to the table to get—
