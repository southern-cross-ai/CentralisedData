       <p>
        Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from Micah Australia while they were in Canberra for the Voices for Justice National Gathering. Their commitment to social justice and their work advocating for public and political change that addresses the root causes of poverty, here and overseas, is to be commended. Our conversation touched on many of the social issues facing Australia today and I wish to draw the attention of the House to one of these issues in particular. Climate change is already hurting the poorest communities in our region. Our Pacific neighbours are facing the very real threat of rising sea levels, which have the potential to displace entire populations over time. On Saturday, I had the opportunity to host the Timor-Leste Ambassador to Australia, Mr Abel Guterres, in my home city of Launceston.

        The combined effects of sea-level rise and climate change makes our near neighbours in the Pacific particularly vulnerable to extreme sea-level events. Indeed, the science continues to indicate that some of our closest

        </a>
        neighbours will be under water within a century, despite global commitments to reducing carbon. Indeed, Micah Australia's message to me was that Australia needs to do more to contribute to a just, peaceful and sustainable Asia-Pacific region. This was at the forefront of my mind as the ambassador and I discussed the Australian-Timorese relationship. As one of the world's wealthiest nations, and with the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions of any developed country, Australia can afford to lead by example.
