       <p>
        Shafiq Rohani is a constituent in my electorate of Adelaide. He worked as a former interpreter for the Australian defence forces in Afghanistan from 2008 through to 2012. He was one of the lucky ones able to get out and come to Australia, and he settled in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        He contacted me in February 2022. He was greatly concerned for the safety and wellbeing of his brother Sadiquallah and his wife and children, who were still in Afghanistan. His brother, too, was an interpreter for the Australian defence forces. He informed me that a global special humanitarian visa application was lodged for his brother and his family in August 2021. I immediately made representations to the former minister for immigration affairs in February 2022, and continued to make subsequent representations to the now minister, the Hon. Andrew Giles, who was assisted greatly in this matter of Shafiq's brother and his case, knowing he was in danger over there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm incredibly proud to be part of a government who takes these matters seriously. I'm especially thankful to the minister, who has worked tirelessly to assist Shafiq and his family. I was extremely pleased to learn that, after advocating on behalf of Shafiq and his family, their visa was granted as of 13 June 2023. It gives me great pleasure that this person and his family will now be safe here in Australia.
