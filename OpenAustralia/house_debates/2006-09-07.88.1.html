        I rise to discuss the great work being achieved by the Upwey-Belgrave
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . On Wednesday, 26 July this year, the Prime Minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        , made time in his heavy schedule to visit the Upwey-Belgrave RSL in my electorate, where he attended a lovely community morning tea. Might I add that it was actually his birthday, so we were privileged to have him. I understand that it was the first visit that a Prime Minister of any political persuasion has made to Upwey. Accordingly, I felt it to be most important that a cross-section of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        community was represented. I was thrilled to see in attendance representatives from our schools, our sporting clubs, our fire brigades, our RSLs, our business community and from other groups across La Trobe—everywhere from Berwick to Boronia. That day I was delighted to have the opportunity to announce that the Upwey-Belgrave sub-branch is to receive $179,000 from the Commonwealth government’s Regional Partnerships program towards an overall $360,000 upgrade of their facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a hand-up, not a handout. Twelve months ago the Upwey-Belgrave sub-branch was really struggling. Since then, there has been an amazing turnaround. Thanks to the hard work of many people, the sub-branch is now viable, is attracting younger members and can look forward to a strong future. Recognition must be given to the following people: Louis Hesterman, Mike Wale, David Brimbacome and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eaton" rel="nofollow">
         David Eaton
        </a>
        ; the local builders, especially Colin Jordon and Ross Carey, who have generously volunteered their time and skills in upgrading the facilities, quite often at no cost; the members of the Upwey-Belgrave RSL committee under the new president, Denis Moffat; and the immediate past president, Mr Rob Ferguson, and his wife, Jill, who have worked tirelessly for the Upwey-Belgrave RSL. Also I must thank the Melbourne East Area Consultative Committee, in particular Sofia Adams and Maya Avdibegovic. I also must thank our ministers—the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon.

        —for the work they have done and that their respective departments do in administering the Regional Partnerships program.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing I would like to make one final point—that is, that the Upwey-Belgrave RSL, like every RSL in my electorate of La Trobe, has made the decision not to install poker machines to raise revenue. They should be roundly congratulated for doing this. It may be the more difficult path but, in my view, it is certainly one that befits my local community. Finally, I again congratulate all our retired service men and women—they are doing a magnificent job.
