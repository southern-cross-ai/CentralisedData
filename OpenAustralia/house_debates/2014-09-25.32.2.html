       <p>
        Today I rise to call on this government to stop the cuts to child care. The government were elected telling the Australian public that they would make child care more affordable. But what have they done? In just over a year, they have already announced just over $1 billion in cuts to existing programs. That includes, in an unprecedented fashion, a bill which is currently before this parliament to cut the means tested childcare benefit, which low- and middle-income families right across Australia rely upon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The education department have let out the truth about this measure. They have stated that over 500,000 low- and middle-income Australian families on incomes as little as $42,000 year will be worse off as a result of this absurd, cruel and heartless measure from those opposite. No government has ever tried to cut the means tested childcare benefit before. It is not just members on this side of the House that will stand up and say that this is wrong and that this must be stopped.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I have the signatures of 25,650 Australian members of the community, including those from the fine electorate of Rankin, who have stood up and called on this government to say enough is enough. It is one thing to break your promise; it is another thing for this cruel and heartless attack on the families that can least afford it.
