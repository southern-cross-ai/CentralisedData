       <p>
        Earlier today and over the weekend I have had contact with Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Marape" rel="nofollow">
         James Marape
        </a>
        , who addressed this parliament just a short time ago. I informed him that all Australians were grieving for those killed in the landslide in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        's Enga province. We hold out hope for the missing and wish strength to those who are now so desperately searching in what is an unimaginable tragedy. We can't envisage what it was like for those in its path—the suddenness of it, the scale of it, the terror of it. Locals have described it as 'like an exploding bomb', rushing towards homes 'like a sea wave'. We do not yet know the full extent of it. Tragically, there are reports that there could be up to 2,000 people buried beneath the mud and the rubble.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Papua New Guineans are suffering in the wake of this terrible disaster, and we hold them in our hearts. James Marape is a good friend of Australia's, and he wanted to convey—symptomatic of the humbleness of the character of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        friends—his thanks and gratitude for our friendship and solidarity at this time. I had a discussion with the Leader of the Opposition about this earlier today, and will provide a briefing for the Leader of the Opposition when more details become apparent. Tragically, at this time, with the nature of where this disaster has happened, information is quite short.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is providing humanitarian assistance to support PNG's response, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for indicating that that will be bipartisan. This afternoon, we're sending technical experts to provide incident management assistance to support geohazard assessments and to help guide recovery efforts. Tragically, we in Australia know about emergencies and disasters, and we do have expertise in these areas. We're providing emergency relief supplies, including shelter, hygiene kits and specific support for women and children. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        have been working alongside their colleagues in the PNG Defence Force to support government and relief workers, and we stand ready to do more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Papua New Guinea is our nearest of neighbours and our closest of friends. We stand with each other through the good times and the bad. Recently, I was with Prime Minister Marape, reflecting on that closeness that saw us through those dark days of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        . At this most tragic of times, I want the people of PNG to know that Australia is there for them and always will be.

        <p>
         I thank the Prime Minister for his fine and heartfelt words, and on behalf of the coalition I extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those affected in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . As the Prime Minister pointed out, Prime Minister Marape was in this parliament only a short time ago, and in his speech he spoke about the rugged nature of the part of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         that we now make reference to—Enga province, up in the north-west. It is a rugged country and it is very difficult to access.
        </p>
        <p>
         The scenes of people trying to dig for loved ones who are buried by hand, trying to move rocks, and some reports of people being under 10 metres of landfill are unimaginable. As the Prime Minister acknowledged, I wrote to him earlier this morning to offer the coalition's support on any decision the government would make to provide additional effort to PNG. The airlifting of heavier equipment, if that's possible, by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         or civil contractors here in Australia—we would very much encourage consideration of that effort and any ways in which we can help in the humanitarian response, in helping people to try and recover those whose lives have been lost and those who may still be trapped.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the Prime Minister for the courtesy of our earlier discussion today. I want Prime Minister Marape, a dear friend to many of us, and all Papua New Guineans to hear the very clear message that Australia will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Papua New Guinea. They are family. In these tragic events, Australia will always come to the fore and provide support to the people of PNG.
