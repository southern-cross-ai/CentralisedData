            Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, the Manager of Opposition Business cannot simply bellow at the dispatch box: 'I move dissent from your ruling.' It is disorderly conduct. If he wants to move motions, he needs to write them and sign them and hand them in to the Clerk.

                 <p>
                  Mr Deputy Speaker, you have not made a ruling on a point of order. What occurred is that I distinctly saw and heard you call the Minister for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
                   Social Services
                  </a>
                  . The Minister for Social Services moved that the motion be put while the Manager of Opposition Business bellowed at you: 'Point of order', but you did not actually recognise him at any point. He did not have the call, nor do you have to give it to him when you had already called the Minister for Social Services. How do you know the Minister for Social Services did not want to make a point of order? And, quite frankly, why would the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order overrule the Minister for Social Services? In fact, you did precisely the right thing, and the motion before the chair is that the motion be put. That is what is before the chair.

                   Subsequent to all the events that were just referred to by the Manager of Government Business, I asked you whether you had made a ruling. You, at that point, said that is your ruling. I have a right under standing orders to move dissent in that ruling and I have done so in writing. I now have a right to speak to the dissent motion.

                     It is a situation, in moving this dissent motion, that we would not be in were there competence from the Minister for
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
                      Social Services
                     </a>
                     . The only reason, Deputy Speaker, that you have been placed in this impossible position is that the Minister for Social Services could not be bothered letting the parliament know that the entire debate we have just had on the age pension is in fact now going to be voted on as a fundamentally different proposition. Each side of the House has made speech after speech and yet, at the eleventh hour, he seeks leave to introduce amendments that completely gut the bill. Apparently, we discover now, the deal that he has been talking about with the Greens, and the deal that the Greens have been claiming that they have got, is not in fact what is going to go through the House today. With the entire national debate that has been happening during the week, the entire debate that has been happening within this House during the course of the week, we find out at the last minute that they now want us to vote with a whole lot of the measures completely taken out—that the deal with the Greens and the dollar figure that was apparently attached to that deal were entirely untrue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We should have had a situation, had they not tried to sneak this through the parliament in the way they have, Deputy Speaker, where we would have been able to raise these issues in the normal way. If the Minister for Social Services had had the capacity to dial the numbers on a telephone and call the shadow minister, call the member for Jagajaga, then we would have had the debate in the normal way.

                     But instead, when this government tries to cover up, the Labor Party will call it out on it. When this government tries to cover up and avoid there being any sort of a decent debate, then we end up with the House again in chaos. We end up again with the chaos that has characterised this legislation, with the chaos that we have seen during the course of this week from those opposite, now once again on full display here within the House of Representatives.

                      Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: a dissent motion has to deal with the issue which is being dissented from. It is not an opportunity for a wide-ranging speech about pension reform.
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manager" rel="nofollow">
                       The Manager
                      </a>
                      of Opposition Business knows that full well. What he has to deal with is whether your decision not to call him on a point of order should be dissented from. He therefore has to deal with points of order, the precedents about points of order and the standing orders surrounding points of order—and nothing else. It is not a dissent motion about you and pensions, as, because you are in the chair, you do not have a position on pensions. So, if he continues to talk on pensions, I will continue to take this point of order, and he knows it.

                       <p>
                        Thanks very much, Deputy Speaker. Threatened as we feel from the Leader of the House, threatening as he can be, he knows full well that a suppression of debate is exactly what they were pressuring the chair to do. The reason we have to move dissent is that the action taken by the chair was to prevent members from this side speaking. The action taken by the chair was to prevent there being a debate within this parliament. If those opposite think they can now try to prevent us from being up front and that that debate was whether or not Labor would stand in the way of pension cuts, well, you have another think coming. If those opposite think that we will somehow be silenced through their little procedural games and not defend Australia's pensioners, well, they have another think coming.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This entire game from those opposite is because they wanted to change the debate. They wanted to change the bill and did not want it to be honestly referred to within this House. And then, when I sought the call to raise these issues, those opposite immediately started to take points of order. Unfortunately, the Deputy Speaker ended up agreeing with them and making a ruling which had one impact. The impact was to say that this is a chamber where, according to those in government, only members of the Liberal and National parties need be heard. The ruling was that those who are standing in defence of pensioners will be silenced. The ruling was—in a complete abuse of the standing orders by the Deputy Speaker—that this government wants to get away with covering up what it is doing to Australia's pensioners.

                        Don't you love the claims from the Leader of the House, who just took a point of order that he used as a speech? He just took a point of order that he used as a speech and now wants to say, 'Oh, but you're abusing standing orders.' The most extraordinary abuses of standing orders happen every day by the man sitting at the table opposite—every day in the way he behaves.

                       <p>
                        And unfortunately, Deputy Speaker, today you fell for it. Unfortunately, Deputy Speaker, you allowed the pressure that was brought on you by a member of your political party to affect how you handled yourself in that chair. Unfortunately, Deputy Speaker, it took until the very end of the entire objection back-and-forth before it occurred to you that you should seek advice from the clerks. I have to say: therein lies the problem. And, once you sought advice from the clerks, that was the first time you recognised that we had the right to move this motion, and we had the right to stand up for Australia's pensioners within this parliament.

                                  I have a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the point of order is that the Manager of Opposition Business can only deal with his right or not to take a point of order under the standing orders. Therefore, he can deal with that and whether you made the right decision or the wrong decision about a point of order. He cannot deal with any other matters. I know you have no material, and you are probably thanking me for taking this point of order, but the reality is that you actually have to stick to the debate.

                                    If there were ever evidence of bias in the chair, it is direct participation in the debate. I have to say that what we have seen today—the claim that I cannot reflect on the chair during a dissent motion—is a ruling that begs a dissent motion, because what we are in is a situation where it is impossible to move a dissent motion without reflecting on your ruling. What you have illustrated in that is exactly the level of bias that shows why we should have been given the call, why the government should not be allowed to get away with the games that they are playing, and why Labor is the only group of people who are standing up for pensioners in this debate.

                                      I second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. This dissent motion is necessary in order to restore proper process to this House. You denied the member for Watson the right to move a point of order. Had he been able to move that point of order, the debate might well have progressed such that we would have moved the adjournment of this debate. That was where it was headed: the proper process around these changes that have been sprung on us by the Minister for

                                      —changes that impact on pensioners and which members of parliament are entitled, through proper process, to be able to scrutinise.

                                      What has occurred here is a jackboots approach to democratic processes in this parliament, and it was exacerbated by your decision as the chair, acting as Speaker, to allow a motion that a motion be put to take precedence when most of the people sitting here—everyone, I suspect, except for the Minister for Social Services—has no idea what is actually before the chair. It has a real impact on people. The normal process in the scrutiny of legislation is that you lay it on the table, it is moved and it then gets adjourned so that there can be proper consideration. What this is about is stopping that process—a complete gutting of a bill that is before the parliament, without any ability to provide proper scrutiny of what the implications of this are for pensioners by those opposite, by those on this side and by the Independents such as the member for Indi.

                                      It is entirely inappropriate for a government to come in here and to move such a motion without even the common courtesy of a phone call to the shadow minister, who knows more about social services and providing assistance to the most vulnerable people in our community than anyone else in this parliament. I will say this about our shadow minister: if it is her up against any of you lot about the needs of vulnerable people, I am with

                                      , the member for Jagajaga. But the member for Jagajaga has not been given the opportunity to scrutinise the amendment that is before the chair and what the implications of it are. Is the minister going to reintroduce the things that he has taken out as a result of this amendment through other legislation? Is there an opportunity for us to go through proper processes? I would be interested in that, perhaps as part of this debate, because this dissent is about whether there is an opportunity to provide proper scrutiny, and what the Deputy Speaker has ruled is not only that you cannot have proper scrutiny but that you cannot even move a point of order to establish a procedural process that would allow for there to be proper scrutiny of this legislation.

                                      Those opposite might have done their deal with the Greens political party, but up until today, up until this motion, we do not know what the details of it are, because the way the Greens political party always function—such as at their conferences, where no-one gets to scrutinise anything—has now infected the government. This is no way to run this sort of legislation. The way that legislation has always operated is for there to be proper scrutiny from all sides of the House in order to assess what the real world implications are, not for people in this chamber but for some of the most vulnerable people in our community.
                                     </p>

                                      Part pensioners have a right to know what the implications of this legislation and the amendments that have been moved are. That is why we have moved dissent here, Mr Deputy Speaker: because you chose to shut down the Manager of Opposition Business, who was perfectly in order in making a point of order which would have then led to a procedural resolution that this debate be adjourned. This can all be resolved if the minister will just agree to adjourn the debate.

                                               With respect to the esteemed position of the Leader of the House, my question was not to the Leader of the House. My question is to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta. It was a situation where people on the crossbench changed their votes, where according to the tellers, did take place. In that circumstance, I am asking: how will it be recorded in

                                               that there were 78 people there, when in fact only 74 people voted on that side? The official record counts four people who never bothered to turn up to the chamber. How can that be?

The tellers have raised that they were told that they had to hand in a count that is inaccurate. If there are 74 people there and the record says 78, how on earth can the official record of this parliament include people voting when they did not in fact vote?

                                                   The standing orders were changed earlier this year to require the tellers to write down exactly the same number as on the previous count. I was aware after doing a head count that there were only 74 members on that side as opposed to 80 on the previous count. Two members changed sides—we were aware of that—but there was an incorrect count that is going to be part of the record of this parliament.

                                                       Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. It is not appropriate for this parliament to simply move on when we have a situation whereby there were 74 people on that side but there were going to be 78 names. What are they going to be—Tory 1, Tory 2, Tory 3 and Tory 4? It is simply not appropriate to just move on with phantom Tories on that side of the House. It is not on. You need to deal with this and you need to deal with it now.

I would ask that you check with the clerks as to whether or not the tellers from both sides signed off on that count. I am asking for that to be done now. We do not have to wait a month. The clerks are right here; the papers are right here; it has either been signed off by the tellers for each side or it has not.

He has been prosecuting the case for this very important budgetary and economic reform for some time. As the House knows, as the members of the public know and as the press gallery knows, he achieved a breakthrough deal with the
                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">

                                                                    </a>

They are supported by the Australian public. They will ensure that those people who should have access to a part pension or a full pension get that access and those who can exist into the future with the resources they already have, without government support, will not.
                                                                   </p>

I come from an electorate in Adelaide's eastern and north-eastern suburbs where there is a very high proportion of part pensioners and self-funded retirees. I can tell the House that I have had virtually no criticism at all in my electorate for this decision from part pensioners who are also self-funded retirees and who will lose that part pension. I think they recognise that $1 million worth of assets, not including their family home, is a substantial resource for them. They can earn the income from those assets that mean they do not have to rely on government support. On the other hand, because of this reform, we can make the age pension sustainable. Those people on lower incomes who get a full pension, those people who exist on the full pension, will get an extra $30 a fortnight in their pension because of this government's changes. That is the effect of the Minister for Social Services extremely important reform.
                                                                   </p>

                                                                    It is passing strange that the Labor Party would oppose this reform. The Labor Party want to keep people with assets of over $1 million, not including their family home, getting a part pension. They want to stop the poorest of pensioners from getting a $30-a-fortnight increase in their pension. That is the effect of the Labor Party's decision in blocking this legislation.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    The debate that we are having now is all about allowing the House to continue through the stages of this debate to make sure that the pension reform bills are passed today and can be sent into the Senate today to be dealt with next week. What I find absolutely remarkable is that the Labor Party have allowed the Greens to steal the clothes of economic rectitude, fiscal rectitude. What the Labor Party are saying is that they are prepared to allow the Greens to become a political party in the Senate and represented here by the member for Melbourne to be more fiscally responsible than the Labor Party. I welcome the Australian Greens' move to the economically sensible position that they have adopted. It is a shame on the Labor Party that they would be so lacking in any principles of fiscal balance and rectitude that they would allow the Greens to do that.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    The actual amendments being moved by the Minister for Social Services today would split the bill in order to take the assets test into a separate bill from the other reforms that have been proposed in the budget. This will allow the Senate to deal with that change cleanly next week, when the government and the Greens together ensure that this reform passes both houses of parliament. I see the Leader of the Opposition joins us in the House. I would implore him to see reason on pension reform—to see reason if only for his own political survival—because it is inimical to the Labor Party's interests to allow the Greens to be economically more responsible than the Labor Party. I have to say as a Liberal that I would prefer it if the Labor Party were more fiscally responsible than the Greens. Madam Speaker, on that note, I sit down because I note that we are at 2 o'clock and question time can therefore begin.
