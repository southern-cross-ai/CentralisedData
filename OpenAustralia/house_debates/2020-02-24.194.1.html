         Gold Coast

        is an amazing multicultural city, and it's enriched by the presence of migrant groups who bring a wealth of diversity. This was on display just a couple of weeks ago when I joined our city's mayor and Gold Coast MPs to welcome 3,000 new Australian citizens from 95 nations, the largest ceremony in our history.

        , to Moncrieff, to showcase the various community groups that assist those coming from diverse backgrounds. We attended the official opening of the new Gold Coast Multicultural Hub in Southport, a one-stop shop to assist migrants and refugees with integration into our community. The hub is equipped for new Australians to meet at one location, to help with language, job training and cross-cultural training. Congratulations to the 'queen', as she likes to be called, Cornelia Babbage, the director of Multicultural Families Organisation on a most successful launch. The Migrant Centre, also in Southport, is a shining example of a team who go above and beyond to assist migrants with employment. Jobs empower people, as we all know, which is why the work they're doing is so important. Congratulations to executive manager Anna Zubac and her team on their success to date. The Multicultural Communities Council Gold Coast supports those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds with access to services, to ensure they have a high quality of life and independence. They also have an incredible program called CURA, which is devoted to seniors and people with a disability who need support to remain in their own home. I'm proud of the multicultural city that is today's Gold Coast.
