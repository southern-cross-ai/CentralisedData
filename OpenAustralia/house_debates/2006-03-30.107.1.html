        Seventeen days ago was a milestone in the lives of the class of ’93. Twenty-seven of us entered this place on 13 March 1993. Sadly, only 15 of us are left. As members may or may not know, in conjunction with the Parliamentary Library, I have numbered all the Australian members of the House of Representatives in alphabetical order as they came in. Much like the Australian cricket team, we all have numbers—from

        It has been a pleasure to serve in this place for 13 years. Those of us in the class of ’93 are now starting our 14th year. Sadly, for some of us, we have telegraphed our intention that this term, our fifth term, will be our last. We have won five premierships in a row, with a sense of satisfaction. I would just like to say to the electors of Franklin that I have enjoyed their support over the past 13 years. For the remainder of my term in this place, I will work just as hard and tirelessly for them. I will not be thwarted in any way when having my say.

        from the Liberal Party will be working, hopefully with me, to ensure that the electors of Franklin receive the very best of service. I was criticised during the state election for saying a few kind words about Nick McKim from the Greens, but I think in this place we should recognise those who work in our electorates in the state arena for the work that they do. As I said, I congratulate Paul Lennon and I look forward to working with him and the other members in Franklin.
