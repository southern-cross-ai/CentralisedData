       <p>
        I am quite angry at the hypocrisy of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAB" rel="nofollow">
         NAB
        </a>
        , particularly their closure of the Pittsworth branch. If you go to Pittsworth, there's a sign on the wall of the bank saying 'NAB, we think local'. If that sign read 'NAB—it's all about profits' or 'NAB—we couldn't give a stuff about locals' I wouldn't have a reason to be so angry. I've spoken to businesses and locals all up and down the street. The response they received from NAB when they ask 'What do we do now? What does this closure mean for us?' has been absolutely disgusting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Simple issues, like how do small businesses get their float to enable cash transactions to continue, NAB had no answer for. They're happy to walk away. They no longer think locally on that. They direct their customers to use the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        , then they don't include those statistics in the number of people who come to the bank. They pretend that people aren't coming to them. You can stand there and watch them, day in and day out. Then they have the gall to say they're going to keep the ATM open. They don't own the premises that the ATM is on, so they can't make that promise to the community. They do not think local. The difference between the offers they've made to staff for determination and what they've said they've made is extraordinary, and I'll say more on that later on. But, worst of all, their entire solution is just to drive to Toowoomba—just drive to Toowoomba! Take the money that's in Pittsworth, drive to Toowoomba and do your banking there. While you're there, you'll probably spend at the grocery store. Just watch our local community go further and further down the sink!

        I'm glad to see that they have a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        . I hope their next CEO actually has the guts to say what's on the wall.
