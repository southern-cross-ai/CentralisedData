         The Statement
        </a>
        of Advice must be signed by the providing entity, or an individual acting on behalf of the providing entity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2B) The client must acknowledge receipt of the Statement of Advice by signing the Statement of Advice as soon as is practicable after it is given to the client.

        (2C) However:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the providing entity does not fail to give a Statement of Advice in accordance with this Subdivision, merely because receipt of the Statement of Advice by the client is not acknowledged as required under subsection (2B).

       <p class="italic">
        (2D) To avoid doubt, a retail client who is given a Statement of Advice may seek further or varied advice from the providing entity.

        Note: This may be necessary if, for example, the client's relevant circumstances (within the meaning of section 961B) change.

        (2E) If the client seeks further or varied advice from the providing entity, the providing entity must ensure that the instructions for that further or varied advice are documented in writing signed by the client (either before or after the advice is given).

       <p class="italic">
        (2F) However:

       <p class="italic">
        (b) the fact that the client does not sign a written copy of the instructions for that further or varied advice is not evidence that the instructions have not been given.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2G) The providing entity, or an individual acting on behalf of the providing entity, must acknowledge receipt of instructions for further or varied advice.

        Note: The expression

        <i>
         Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993
        </i>
        applies. (Section 99F of that Act prohibits trustees of regulated superannuation funds from passing on the cost of providing certain kinds of financial product advice in relation to one member of the fund to another.)

        Today I move amendments to better target the measures in the bill. Following the referral of the bill to the Senate Economics Committee, the government conducted additional consultation on its changes to the Future of Financial Advice provisions. The amendments I move today have been informed by this further round of consultation and the inquiry into the bill undertaken by the Senate Economics Committee.
       </p>

        The amendments to the bill work to further clarify the operation of FoFA and better target the measures proposed by the bill. Further, the bill also amends the statement of advice requirements to implement the additional improvements agreed with the Palmer United Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party. The first and seventh amendments make a number of changes to the statement of advice requirements to ensure clients are aware of their rights and their adviser's obligations in providing advice in their best interests. The amendments require the statement of advice to be signed by both the adviser and the client, and require any instructions from clients for further or varied advice be signed by the client and acknowledged by the adviser.

        The second amendment makes a change to the definition of a 'basic banking product' to ensure products functionally equivalent to those already listed in the definition or products that may not always be related to a basic banking product are included in the definition. The third amendment extends the time period that advisers are required to send a fee disclosure statement to a client in an ongoing fee arrangement from 30 to 60 days after the client's anniversary date. This will ensure the fee disclosure requirements are flexible and adaptable to different practices in the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (4) makes two key changes. First, it amends the provision that allows benefits to be paid in relation to execution-only services to ensure that the benefit can only be given if financial product advice, as opposed to personal advice, has not been given to the retail client in the previous 12 months by the person receiving the benefit. Second, amendment (4) makes changes to better target the general advice provision and make it clear that commissions are banned under FoFA. The government has supported the ban on commissions and conflicted remuneration for financial advisers since it was first legislated. At no point has the government sought to reintroduce commissions or conflicted remuneration for financial advisers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments (5) and (6), and amendment (4) in part, put in place regulation-making powers that may prescribe circumstances in which all or part of a benefit is to be treated as conflicted remuneration. That is, if—contrary to our clear expectation and our intention not to bring back conflicted remuneration—developments in the market want our intervention, we could and would address this issue very quickly through regulations. We do not believe that this will be necessary. Amendments (4), (5) and (6) put absolutely beyond doubt how serious the government is about not permitting commissions.
