       <p>
        Farmers are the custodians of much of our land and are a crucial component in looking after the country and its economy. For the future, the successful transition of farms between generations is critical. I recently opened a workshop in Bundaberg which focused on that issue. It was attended by agri-advisers, farmers, peak body representatives, banks and development practitioners. Nationwide, around 70,000 people previously working in agriculture have left the industry because of the recent terrible and, in some areas, ongoing drought. As the drought fully breaks, the sector will be crying out for people to come back into agriculture and horticulture, for people to work on farms, to handle livestock, to grow crops. As well, rural communities are looking to keep more young people in the country to ensure regional sustainability.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that the right mix of incentives and training is offered to attract workers back to agriculture and horticulture and to encourage our young farmers to stay on the land. As we see prices of food commodities rise, attracting young people into farming is crucial for the future of Australian rural industry and the price of commodities. At the moment, only a third of all people in agriculture, fisheries and forestry are aged between 18 and 35. With the average age of Australia’s farmers currently at 58 years—and in Bundaberg, my home district, even higher, at 62½—the contribution of young farmers is essential. It is likely that they are going to have to learn industry leadership roles very quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Succession planning makes a real difference in managing the transition of farming operations from the current generation to the next generation. Of course, this only partially happens when a farm is passed on informally in a family. Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers, Canegrowers Bundaberg and AgForce are conscious of this issue. Against this background, the convener of the workshop, Patrick Logue, and his colleagues offered some models for enticing young people back to the land. Patrick, a horticulture adviser closely involved in the macadamia industry, proposed a subsidy and mentoring scheme—based on one he experienced in Zimbabwe before coming to Australia—to help young people to own their own farms. We need to investigate that sort of model further. I also recognise AgForce for its proactive stance in supporting and developing the state’s agricultural sector. AgForce gives its members the training and guidance that they need to manage their farms well and actively encourages young people to consider a career on the land. Finally, the school to industry partnership program sponsored by the Queensland government is the only program of its kind in Australia and has grown from strength to strength since the year 2004. So far, 12,000 students have been in this program. If it continues, as the government plans, to the year 2011 there will be another 60,000 students.
