        'I would rather that the people of Australia could make their view clear on this than leaving this issue to 150 people'—that's the coalition government's position on same-sex marriage, quite eloquently put by the opposition leader. It sounds like he's giving public support for a plebiscite, and it was not so long ago—in 2013, I believe. We love it when the opposition leader voices a commonsense view, but his colleagues, his union buddies and the Australian voters must shudder at some of his musings.

        That comment can only be taken one way, as public support for a plebiscite. But did he vote for it? No. Why not? Being a man of his word would be a curve ball, given he's much better known for flip-flopping. He seems committed to maintaining his record of hypocrisy.

        he said it's 'reasonable to look for English language proficiency', but will he vote in support of English language proficiency for new Australians? Of course not. He says, 'Corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow.' Did he vote for it? No. He talks tough on multinational tax avoidance, but when push comes to shove he rolls over and votes No. He says he'll support the findings of the Fair Work Commission, but votes no. Practise what you preach or change your speech. Your duplicity's an insult to your position of office. (Time expired)
