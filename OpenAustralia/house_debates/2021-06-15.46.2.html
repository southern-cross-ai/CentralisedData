       <p>
        I wish to update the House on the storms that have wreaked havoc on regional Victoria over the past week. The storms have turned roads into rivers, paddocks into lakes and plunged entire communities into darkness, and, sadly, so very tragically, two lives have been lost. A man in his 60s lost his life in floodwaters in Woodside, eastern Victoria, on Thursday. On Friday, a woman, just in her 20s, was lost at Glenfyne in the state's south-west. She was driving to work. She never arrived. We extend to the families, the loved ones and friends our deepest sympathies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The storms and resulting flooding have up-ended so many communities, so many lives, during a time when many might be asking, 'How much more do we have to face?' To all affected today, know that we face what is ahead together, as Australians always do. The damage has particularly hit the electorates of Gippsland, Monash and your electorate of Casey, Mr Speaker. I recognise the efforts made by members—and members on the other side; I see the member for Ballarat—to assist residents of these communities and others where they have been affected, all of those electorates, all of those communities, all of those regions. In total, 37 local government areas have been affected. I acknowledge the work of the various members of parliament, electorate officers supporting their local communities and, indeed, I acknowledge the first responders. As the situation remains serious, as the state braces for further bad weather later this week, we are with them all the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to update the House on the situation on the ground today. As at 9.30 this morning, 17,506 Victorian households were still without power. There are 129 Telstra network sites and 16 Optus sites that remain down, and 11 communities have faced isolation: Athlone, Binginwarri, Boolarra, Kurrajong, Devon North, Poowong, Poowong North, Strzelecki, Willung South, Kallista and Sherbrooke. We understand that these communities are still unable to contact triple 0 emergency services. I can also report that Energy Australia's Yallourn Power Station has been evacuated due to a crack in the mine wall and the high-water levels of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morwell_River" rel="nofollow">
         Morwell River
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        With such extensive damage to networks, a time line for full power restoration is currently unknown. The Victorian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        has received more than 9,000 requests for assistance since the beginning of these storms last week. Most of those relate to downed trees, building damage, flood and rescue. The SES has been doing tremendous work, as they always do, answering these calls.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maroondah Highway remains closed between Narbethong and Healesville. The mountain highway is also closed. I can also report that the response efforts around Victoria have scaled up and are progressing well. Recovery efforts are underway. The focus now is on clearing and stabilising roads and bridges to make them safe. Offers of assistance have been made and the Australian government stands ready to assist, if need be. Emergencies services and Victorians are also bracing for what may well be ahead. A moderate flood warning remains in place for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_River" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe River
        </a>
        . High levels of the river remain steady across impacted areas and are receding, thankfully, but there is a possibility of 20 to 30 millimetres of rainfall over impacted areas during the week. Southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Water

         Lake Glenmaggie
        </a>
        is expected to spill in coming days; inflows to that system are continuing to reduce, thankfully.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is providing support as needed. I can report that categories A and B of the joint federal and state Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements have been activated. This is for all of the 37 local government areas in central and eastern Victoria impacted by these floods and storms. Available assistance measures include personal hardship and distress, personal and financial counselling, counterdisaster operations, removal of debris from residential properties as well as the restoration of damaged essential public assets. We will respond to further requests for assistance as necessary at this difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I again wish to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts and the remarkable endeavours of our volunteers and emergency services. They undertake their roles in very, very difficult and dangerous circumstances. They do it completely without fanfare. I also want to pay tribute to Victorians, who have responded within their own communities with bravery, with selflessness and with an overwhelming sense of community. There's the farmer in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         South Gippsland
        </a>
        who began milking his neighbour's cows to help out. There's the cafe proprietaries at Yarra who have been offering free hot meals and device recharging for those without power. There's the man who saved a bus driver being swept away in Taralga. He said: 'I was pretty physically buggered. Oh well. It's what you do, isn't it?' Such an Australian thing to say; such bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby club had their premises and equipment totally destroyed by floods but have been strengthened by the community rallying around them. One of them said, 'There were lots more tears today, but we got through this.' The resilience of Australians in crisis can only be summed up by one word: humbly. For Victorians who are dealing with dual crises, it is even more so. The situation is far from over, with the next low pressure expected later in the week. Emergency services are working to ensure people remain safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        With any flood, as we saw earlier this year across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , we know that the disaster is not over when the rain stops or the water recedes. There will be many difficult days, weeks and months ahead as communities take the first steps to rebuild and recover. That path out will be unimaginably difficult for the loved ones of the two Australians whose lives have been lost. The thoughts of all Australians are with them today, as are, I know, the thoughts of the Prime Minister. I will endeavour to keep the House updated as the situation in Victoria continues to evolve. Thank you.

         in expressing the solidarity of this House with the people of Victoria who are going through this difficult time. Floods have transformed parts of Victoria into a brown inland sea. Other parts of the state have been battered by winds of up to 125 kilometres an hour. Homes and businesses have been flooded or destroyed by trees brought down by wild winds. The Victorian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         experienced its busiest 24-hour period in its history. There have been stories of heroism, near misses and lucky escapes. There have been stories of families who just happened to be in the right part of the house when a tree crashed through the roof. As Kalorama resident Braeden Tairi told the

         Tragically, two people have lost their lives. Nina Barake, aged 20. She was driving to work when things went wrong. Remembered by friends as 'incredible' and 'one of a kind', she'd barely started the adventure of adulthood and now she has gone. The other victim was Brian Gilliland, a father of four and an auto electrician in his 60s, remembered by his friends as being down to earth and gentle. A great bloke. Our hearts with their families and friends as they try to come to terms with what has happened.
        </p>
        <p>
         What has been reassuring but in no way surprising is that the spirit we saw on display in the bushfires and during COVID has been on full display, with communities pulling together, friends helping friends, strangers helping strangers, and SES workers putting themselves on the line, risking their lives for their fellow Victorians. Two SES volunteers have been hospitalised during recovery works, with one suffering a broken shoulder blade and another a broken wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that over 17,000 properties are still without power. It is something of a cruel irony that some are still without drinking water. Acting Premier James Merlino has said that financial assistance will be available to all eligible Victorians who have suffered the impact of floods and storm damage. I note the Acting Prime Minister's support in the form of federal assistance as well—that is entirely appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is unfortunate that more rain is expected. The usual advice applies: never drive into flood water no matter how shallow it looks and no matter how confident you think you are about your driving skills. This can be dangerous and is simply not worth the risk. We say to the people at the heart of this tragedy, stay safe. The rest of Australia stands with you at this difficult time.
