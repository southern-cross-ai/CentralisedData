        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House when he was first notified that the people aboard the

        would not be permitted to land at the port of Merak? When was the Prime Minister informed that the people on board were to be transferred to the

        <p>
         On the first part of the question, if you were to try and ask me—and I thank the member for Murray for her question—as to the precise sequence of events, I cannot recall each step in that sequence of events. I honestly cannot. It was a fast-flowing series of events. As for the second part of the question, I simply refer the honourable member to the answer that I gave on this question yesterday. These are complex diplomatic negotiations and are occurring at multiple levels between the government and the government of Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, in this connection, I notice a particular report in a national newspaper today about some of the tactics which may be driving opposition questions on this matter—particular tactics which perhaps derive from a report, mentioned in today’s
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         , entitled ‘Digging dirt’.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Even with the very broad definition of relevance which has crept into the parliamentary standards over the years, this could not possibly be relevant to the question he was asked, which was specifically about when he knew certain important pieces of information about the 78 asylum seekers aboard the
          <i>

            Absolutely, Mr Speaker. That is why I always welcome questions from the member for Murray and always welcome the wider environment in which she asks those questions, particularly given the fact that the document in question said:

             Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the Prime Minister is defying your request for him to make his answer relevant to the question. It was a very specific question and I would ask you to use your authority as the Speaker to ensure he complies with the rules.

              <p>
               Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said in response to the member for Murray’s question today and again yesterday, the precise sequence of events concerning the handling of this particular vessel I cannot recall in absolute detail—they were complex diplomatic negotiations. But I would hope that, in the member for Murray’s long record of consistency on these questions, which extends through her parliamentary career and her deep and continuing commitment to the interests and fair treatment of asylum seekers, which has not undergone any change at all over time, she too if she were part of a government would also respond to appropriate distress signals which are given in accordance with international maritime law, given that the interests of Australians around the world lie in those conventions also being adhered to.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also wonder whether some of the stereotypes referred to in this note, which was part of the ‘Digging dirt’ document revealed in the
               <i>
                Australian
               </i>
               today, may have dealt with the stereotyping of asylum seekers.
