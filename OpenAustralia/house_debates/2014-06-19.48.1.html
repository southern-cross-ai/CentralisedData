        I was delighted last Saturday to attend the Racecourse Road Winter Lights Festival. It was a day of high activity and fun for the people of Brisbane. I was pleased to join my state and council colleagues the member for Clayfield, the Hon.

        in the evening. It was the second year that we were treated to an absolutely stunning lantern parade with a circus theme. There were performances happening all along the road to the festival, and it was a truly interactive experience. The day would not have been complete without the presence of some of Brisbane's finest performers, entertainers and musicians. We were treated to some community and jazz performances as well as a live art show.

        for her support of the festival; Jacqui Bartholomeusz from Bartholomeusz Kirwan Real Estate, who was instrumental in the formation of the neighbourhood watch group; and Bev Sotiriou of Lido Cafe, who, as part of the Racecourse Road Business Group, is one of the instigators of the festival.

        Those of us who were fortunate to attend despite the very inclement weather had some wonderful cheese on display and for tasting purposes. There were 20 of Australia's finest cheeses there. The day was a huge success with wonderful entertainment for everyone. It was a great family day out and it was so fantastic to see so many creative, talented and innovative people having a great time.
