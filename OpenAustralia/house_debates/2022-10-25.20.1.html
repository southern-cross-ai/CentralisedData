        Someone can have a wisdom beyond their years. I was reminded of this fact when I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulfield_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Caulfield Grammar School
        </a>
        's Malvern campus recently. The children were prepared for my visit and not only peppered but hammered me with searching questions. Question time is nothing compared to standing up in front of a class of grade 5s and 6s. I found myself answering a range of questions. From Davy: 'What impact do you make and how do you know you are making the right decisions?' Or from Hamish: 'What kind of problems do you solve?' Or from Jack: 'What are the negatives about being an MP?' Or from Edric: 'How often are you engaged in debate and do you like it?' To which I admitted that despite being a bit of an introvert by nature I found question time quite entertaining and a little bit fun.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then came a curly one from Siena: 'Have you ever disagreed with something your party said?' I was truthful and I said yes, I have, but when you're a member of a party like mine you work together and reach consensus. Working together is an effective way of getting things done; in fact it's the only way. I also said that being in government means you have to have a responsibility not only to your own electorate but to others' electorates. We need to make sure that our decisions don't adversely impact anyone else.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I left Caulfield Grammar I admired the gorgeous old buildings, the gardens, the playground and the many caring, dedicated teachers. I reflected again on how our children shape our future by challenging and questioning.
