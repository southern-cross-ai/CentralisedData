        My question is for the Minister for the Environment and Water. Minister, we've heard that the Antarctic Division overspent by $42 million while winding back important science programs, that our new icebreaker can't refuel in Hobart and that the just-released Macquarie Point plan shows its Antarctic facilities zone will be about as big as two shoeboxes and not exclusively dedicated to Antarctic purposes. When will the government get serious about protecting the frozen continent and honouring our international treaty obligation?

         I want to thank the member for Clark for his question and reassure him as a very active local member that we are deadly serious about making sure that Hobart is the home to Antarctic science and that Australia's Antarctic science continues to be world class. The sad truth is that the former Liberal government was irresponsible in managing Australia's Antarctic Program. Because of that, we've had three inquiries into the Antarctic Division in just 18 months: the recent Senate inquiry and before that the Nash and Russell inquiries. Those inquiries uncovered the fact that there were very serious bullying and harassment in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Antarctic Division
         </a>
         , and we are working to clean up that mess.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also locked in significant long-term funding for the Australian Antarctic Program. In fact, its budget is going up every year, year after year, for the next three years, and it is higher every year than it would have been under those opposite. Fixing the Antarctic Program is a big job, but we are getting on with it. As Dr Brian Miller, a current employee of the division, told the Senate inquiry this month, 'I believe the ship is turning. I feel like things are getting better slowly. Twelve months ago I would not have appeared before this committee because I would have feared the repercussions.' He went on to say: 'We know the importance of the work. We need some help to get back on track, so we can do the important work we've been sent out to do.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor is getting the Antarctic Division back on track. Our priority is supporting the critical science and permanent jobs that come with that, especially in Tasmania. Our Antarctic scientists are doing terrific research on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denman_Glacier" rel="nofollow">
          Denman Glacier
         </a>
         , the million-year ice core, the ice cap, greenhouse gases in the southern atmosphere and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member asked about the
         <i>
          Nuyina
         </i>
         , the magnificent ship that's been built. The previous Minister for the Environment, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was minister when that ship was delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         She's very proud of it, she interjects. It can't sail under the bridge in Hobart, which means that it can't refuel in Hobart, currently. In fact, the ship, since it was delivered in 2021, has spent 18 months in dry dock. The budget overruns are because we've been having to rent vessels to replace the
         <i>
          Nuyina
         </i>
         , because it's been in dry dock for the 18 months since it was delivered. I understand the concerns of the member for Clark. We're fixing up the mess that those opposite left us, but we are absolutely determined to make sure that world-class science stays in Hobart and that we continue our international obligations in Antarctica.
