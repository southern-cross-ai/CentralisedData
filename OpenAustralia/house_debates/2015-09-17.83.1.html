        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the role of the 457 visa in creating jobs and building the economy? How does engagement with our overseas neighbours help boost jobs and growth here in Australia? What obstacles are there to that engagement?

          I thank the member for Forde for his question. He is a great local member who works hard for industry within his area and he is very supportive of small business. As all Australians know, the 457 visa program, which has been around for a long time, has been one way in which we can build Australian industry, and in WA we know that, whilst many more people came in on a 457 visa under Labor than are under this government, it has been an integral part of the way in which we have been able to grow the economy.

          this morning—as all good Australians should! I read a great story by Daniel Meers about the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
           CFMEU
          </a>
          's anti-China campaign hypocrisy. I thought: 'Our old friends at the CFMEU? That rings a bell because they've been opposed to 457 visas.' And you know what? It reminded me of the ad we referred to in question time a couple of weeks ago where the union dad was there with the union son, offering him the job in the union only to find that the position had been taken by a foreign worker. It made me go and have a look at the CFMEU website and WA CFMEU merchandise catalogue, which I have printed out because I thought it would be interesting reading.
         </p>
         <p>
          What can you get from the CFMEU? All of these products are made in China, of course. You can get the CFMEU black T-shirt—blood resistant, can't tell the stains within the black, which is helpful for the bikies that have joined the CFMEU! You can have a look at the

           <p>
            The point is that the Labor Party is full of hypocrisy. This Leader of the Opposition is like a bad gambler with debts all over the union movement. The

             CFMEU
            </a>
            offered support at the Labor Party conference to get through the temporary turn back policy that was put through. This Leader of the Opposition like no Labor leader in the past owes these union bosses in a way that would be detrimental to the future of this country. People in Canning should remember this. Labor and the unions are full of hypocrisy and they are against Australian jobs.
