        Approximately 4,000 veterans live in the electorate of Longman. Today I would like to introduce to the Federation Chamber just two of those veterans who live in my electorate. First of all I would like to introduce Darryl Shipp. Darryl is the Queensland state secretary of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. Darryl served as a leading aircraftman in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        . As I said, he is now the state secretary in Queensland. He now spends his time continuing to work in the community. Of course, he spends a lot of time at Remembrance House in Burpengary helping veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other person I would like to introduce is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Jock Young
        </a>
        . Jock is the secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. Jock served as a sergeant in the No. 35 Squadron. He now spends his days working with the community. In fact, he helps out community groups like Dragons Abreast that paddle on the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumicestone_Passage" rel="nofollow">
         Pumicestone Passage
        </a>
        . He also fills his days helping the veteran community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a really great privilege to once again be invited to two ceremonies this Saturday for Vietnam Veterans Day, an incredibly important day. The Caboolture sub-branch will be celebrating Vietnam Veterans Day at Remembrance House in Burpengary. They will start with a march and finish with a service at the Progress Road memorial. I'm looking forward to joining John, Paddy, Bruce, Trevor and their wonderful secretary, Elfie Cox. It'll be an absolute honour to join them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later in the day we will head over to Bribie Island, where I will join Reverend Colin Baxter, Doug, Ray, Arnold, Jill and Jock. We will start with a march as well on Bribie just down the road from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and finish with a service at the memorial park across the road from the RSL. It will be the 26th anniversary of this event on Bribie Island.
       </p>
       <p>
        The VVAA motto is: honour the dead and fight like hell for the living. It is an absolute honour to be invited again to participate in those services on Saturday. I say to every serving, retired and remembered service man and woman: thank you for your service. Our community thanks you for your service. Our country thanks you for your service.
