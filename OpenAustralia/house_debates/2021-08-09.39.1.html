        Disappointingly for me, the fantastic Lot Fourteen precinct, the subject of the city deal between the Commonwealth, state and Adelaide council, is just outside of my electorate of Sturt. But it's literally on the border and I take a very keen interest in its progress because so many of my constituents will have the opportunity of being associated with the many and varied exciting economic and cultural activities that are happening there.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week we had the exciting development around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Art" rel="nofollow">
         Aboriginal Art
        </a>
        and Cultures Centre, a $200 million new facility to be built on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         North Terrace
        </a>
        which is funded as part of our city deal. The finalised concept drawings were completed and released publicly. Now, of course, the final stages of development approval are being undertaken with the hope that we'll see a sod turned on that element of the project early next year. This is a milestone achievement for what is the jewel in the crown of that development. The whole precinct has nearly a billion dollars worth of investment, which will create thousands of jobs in emerging industries into the future. One of the really important cultural anchor elements of it is the Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre. I'm really pleased to see this progressing on time. It's going to be an exciting cultural institution for not just the people of Sturt and the city of Adelaide but the whole nation to celebrate Indigenous art and cultures. I'm proud to be part of a government that's delivering this project.
