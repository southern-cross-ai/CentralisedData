        Last Saturday I spoke on the opening day of the 4th Annual State Conference for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Health_Care" rel="nofollow">
         Primary Health Care
        </a>
        , Research, Evaluation and Development at the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame" rel="nofollow">
         Notre Dame
        </a>
        in my electorate of Fremantle. Primary health care is critically important, and it follows that research, evaluation and development in this area is critically important. The PHCRED strategy is a program funded by the Commonwealth government which promotes and supports a collaborative research culture between consumers and organisations to develop and improve primary healthcare policy, practice and service delivery. All things considered, especially in a global context, we are lucky that we have what is, by world standards, a very good health system. But we know it could be better, and in some areas, like Indigenous health, it could be a lot better.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the speakers at the conference was Associate Professor Lyn Henderson-Yates, Director of the Centre for Indigenous Studies from the Broome campus of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame" rel="nofollow">
         University of Notre Dame
        </a>
        . The centre, which just opened in August, aims to contribute to the country’s stock of Indigenous knowledge by engaging in several research projects. These will hopefully strengthen Aboriginal communities and provide them with the ability to advance the health and welfare status of their members. At this time, in a post-reconciliation Australia, research and development funding is not a luxury, it is not an added bonus and it is certainly not an indulgence—it is an absolute necessity.
