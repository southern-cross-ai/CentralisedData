          In relation to the question raised by the member for Fraser in relation to the Kalyna Care COVID-19 outbreak, I note the following information. Kalyna Care notified the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Health
          </a>
          that they had a positive case on 27 July 2020. The Department of Health organised clinical first responders, nurse testing, workforce support and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
           PPE
          </a>
          as soon as this notification occurred. The spread of the virus at Kalyna Care occurred because a COVID-positive staff member that worked in the kitchen had contact with a large number of residents prior to being diagnosed with the virus. Testing of staff and residents by Sonic commenced at Kalyna Care the day after the department was notified: 28 July. The Australian government responded to each request from Kalyna Care for workforce support and provided a range of surge staff from 31 July onwards. The majority of positive residents remain at the facility. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          and leadership of Djerriwarrh Health Services are assisting with facility management. The Department of Health and the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre is continuing to provide intensive support to Kalyna Care until the outbreak is resolved. However, approved providers of residential aged-care facilities, like the Ukrainian Elderly Peoples Home, have a responsibility, obviously, to their residents, as I have noted in the other cases.

          In relation to the question raised by the member for Scullin, Heritage Care Epping Gardens notified the Department of Health that they had a positive case on 20 July. The Department of Health organised a case manager, a clinical first responder, testing, workforce support and PPE as soon as this notification occurred. I understand that the spread of the virus at Epping Gardens occurred because a COVID-positive staff member had contact with a large number of residents prior to being diagnosed with the virus. Testing of staff and residents commenced at Epping Gardens on the same day the positive COVID-19 case was identified. That was 19 July. I note that media reports that the outbreak was due to a lack of testing are not correct. The Australian government responded to each test from Epping Gardens for workforce support and provided a range of surge staff from 21 July on onwards. While some residents remain at the facility, the majority of the residents at Epping Gardens have been transferred to hospital. The Department of Health and the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre will continue to provide intensive support to Epping Gardens until this outbreak is resolved.
