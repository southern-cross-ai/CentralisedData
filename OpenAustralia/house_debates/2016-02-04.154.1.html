       <p>
        I rise to congratulate and to commend three outstanding citizens from my electorate of Robertson who were awarded Medals of the Order of Australia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order" rel="nofollow">
         The Order
        </a>
        of Australia is the pre-eminent way we recognise achievements and service. I am proud to speak today about Geoffrey Grenfell
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , Denise Begg OAM and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Donald Young
        </a>
        OAM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Donald Young, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        , received the medal for service to veterans and their families. I was pleased to be able to write in support of Don for his recognition, because his service has been wide-ranging in our community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        over many decades. Don is often out doing voluntary work with youth rehabilitation and police. However, it is his tireless work for veterans that stands out. Don spends countless hours every week visiting veterans on the Central Coast, particularly those who are disabled, and supporting their wives, widows, carers and families. Often it is to assist with pension and welfare issues or with health and aged-care matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don has had long-held roles with organisations like the Gosford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch, the Woy Woy Ettalong-Hardys Bay RSL sub-branch, the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club, National Malaya and Borneo Veterans Association and the Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia. He has also been a member of the RSL in Australia since 1956. After receiving the award, Don admitted that he was a bit shocked but also very honoured. It is an honour well deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Denise Begg, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Frederick" rel="nofollow">
         Point Frederick
        </a>
        , is also a highly deserving local recipient of an OAM for her service to young people through the Scouting movement. Denise was the group leader of the 1st Clovelly Scout Group from 1986 to 2012 and a Cub
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Leader" rel="nofollow">
         Scout Leader
        </a>
        for six years before that. Across three decades of service, she has received a Silver Koala, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Wattle" rel="nofollow">
         Silver Wattle
        </a>
        , and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Merit" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of Merit
        </a>
        . Denise said she was shaking when she received her OAM, but her commitment to young people has been unwavering, and it is great to have her acknowledged as a member of our Central Coast community. It also reflects just how strong the Scouting movement is on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third recipient in my electorate, Geoffrey Grenfell, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erina_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Erina Heights
        </a>
        , has also been awarded an OAM for service to the community of the Central Coast and also to youth. Like Denise, Geoffrey has served as a Scout Leader. He said he joined the Scouts when he was just eight, and now at age 77 he loves being a part of it. Geoffrey has been an Honorary Commissioner of the Hunter and Coastal Region since 1996, and his leadership at 1st Erina Heights dates back to 1957. He has been a great leader in Rotary in our community for over 40 years, spending the majority of his time in Gosford and a decade at Terrigal. And he has a great passion for the local arts scene on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, on behalf of the Central Coast community, I offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to these remarkable people. They reflect the calibre and character of the many others who tirelessly and sacrificially serve our community every day.
