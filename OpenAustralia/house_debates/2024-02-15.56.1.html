       <p>
        Today I rise to honour the life of a wonderful man, Lyndsay Godfrey, who passed away earlier this week. Lyndsay was born in 1947 in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . He joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        in 1963, spending two years in Malaysia before returning to Western Australia and joining their police force in 1972.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1978, Lyndsay moved to Tasmania and joined our police force, serving for 30 years until his retirement in 2009. He spent a significant amount of time involved in police search and rescue, receiving commendations for his conduct. It was during this time, through search and rescue, that he met Di, an avid bushwalker. Di fondly remembers the two of them undertaking a lot of bushwalks in the early days, and converting Lyndsay from a hockey player to a golfer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lyndsay was a dedicated member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch in Lilydale for 18 years, serving as president from 2017. He is remembered as being a great mentor for the younger generation and an advocate for mental health support for emergency services workers and military personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lyndsay was married to Di for 28 years and was a beloved father to his two sons and the daughter he reconnected with 20 years ago. I knew Lyndsay to be an incredibly kind, generous and gentle person, and he is remembered as being so proud of his children's and grandchildren's achievements and for his wicked sense of humour and infectious smile. When reflecting on the love they had for each other, Di reflects, 'He accepted me for who I was and what I was.' Vale, Lyndsay. You will be missed.
