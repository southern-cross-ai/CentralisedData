        I'm very excited to be hosting the 4th annual North Sydney Seniors Expo on 10 October this year. This is a wonderful opportunity for seniors in my electorate to come together to learn more about local services. The expo showcases local community and volunteer groups, business, aged-care services and government agencies that provide services and opportunities to senior Australians living on the

        . I am thrilled that General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove has agreed to open and speak at the expo and that

        will accompany him. Sir Peter has made his post-vice-regal home in our area and, as he said to me recently, he is one of our newest retirees. Sir Peter has made an extraordinary contribution to Australian life and is well loved by so many Australians. I'm sure many people will value an opportunity to hear from this great Australian.

        I'm also very grateful to all the organisations who participate, particularly community organisations and volunteer groups that provide opportunities for seniors. These organisations underpin the very fabric of our society and help maintain strong connections with the community. My thanks also goes to Norths, at Cammeray, who are hosting this event again for us this year. Last year there was extraordinarily interest in the expo, partly because of the rock star attraction of

        , and it was pleasing to see so many hundreds attend. I encourage all those who are interested to come along and take part this year.
