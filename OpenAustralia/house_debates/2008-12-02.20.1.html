         Today I was pleased to launch the national aviation policy green statement at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          National Press Club
         </a>
         just prior to question time. This is the first time that Australia will develop a national aviation strategy and I look forward to receiving input. Submissions close on 27 February next year and we will be releasing the white paper in the second half of 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Speaker, aviation is essential to Australia’s economic prosperity. Last year a record 23 million international and 49 million domestic passengers passed through the nation’s airports. The aviation sector indirectly employs some half a million Australians and contributes $6.4 billion to the Australian economy. But if we are going to continue to benefit from the economic and social advantages of aviation, we do need to plan ahead. The green paper outlines a number of proposals and initiatives by the government. Primarily, it reaffirms the government’s first priority is safety and the government’s commitment to establish a small, independent board.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         —Australia’s aviation safety regulator—is central to that. The government will also enhance the independence of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Transport_Safety_Bureau" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Transport Safety Bureau
         </a>
         by establishing it as a statutory agency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The green paper also proposes a range of measures which strike a balance between the needs of the airports and the communities in which they operate. Up until now, it is fair to say that airport planning has not been handled properly. Too often airport development has not taken into account the development around the airport or the interests of the community around those airports. The green paper proposes a number of ways to facilitate community consultation with the operators of airports in the interests of expanding the industry, but not at the expense of the communities in which airports exist. After the birth of aviation almost 100 years ago, it has been a long time coming, but I look forward to constructive input from the industry and from the community into this white paper process.
