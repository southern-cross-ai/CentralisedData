        Today I would like to share the story of a very impressive young man who studies at Belmont State School in my electorate of Bonner. Kein Sheldrake has achieved amazing things at just 11 years of age. He currently builds and refurbishes computers and donates them to children and families who could not otherwise afford them. This is remarkable in itself, but it is the story behind his work that has touched me deeply and deserves recognition. Last year, Kein taught himself how to build a

         PC
        </a>
        by watching
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">

        videos. After successfully building his first computers, he decided to use his skills to provide for others less well off. With the help of his mum, Michelle, he set up a GoFundMe page in January to raise funds to help him build and refurbish PCs for kids whose families could not afford them. He was able to make contacts in the community, and was put onto a service that does work with refugee families. So far two of his computers have gone to refugees from the Congo. Kein's enthusiasm for helping those in need is admirable, and I commend him for helping give others access to technology and to the internet. Michelle recently told me that her son has Asperger's syndrome. She wanted me to mention this to show how a condition such as Asperger's does not have to prevent a person from following their passion. I have to agree. Well done to Kein, who has a very promising future in his dream career of
