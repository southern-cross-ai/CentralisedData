        I've recently hosted a wonderful year 10 work experience student, Arni Patel, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nossal_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Nossal High School
        </a>
        , a great selective public school in Berwick. One of Arni's tasks was to write me a speech outlining what her peers think about politics and the future of our country. Taking this responsibility seriously, Arni said, 'Yes. What's the deadline? I'll get back to you.' She showed outstanding leadership. She didn't presume. She surveyed her year 10 student peers and listened to them. Here are Arni's words—and there's a warning: Arni takes no prisoners. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Hill
        </a>
        for the opportunity to have my say in Parliament and recognise that it is something that other people my age could merely dream of.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It can be frustrating to be young in this country. To not have a say in the policies that will impact us the most, while those who do get to vote may not live to see the effects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As someone who dreams to be in your position, I would hate to have to be the person reversing your mistakes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The biggest issues my peers expressed, concerned the environment and climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet for many people in this parliament, the issue of climate change doesn't seem to be that big a priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After all, taking action to save the environment doesn't satisfy the lobby groups or mining companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And after the damage is done,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YOU" rel="nofollow">
         YOU
        </a>
        all won't have to worry the about 45-degree summers and rampant natural disasters that will probably become the norm in a few decades' time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet we are expected to ignore this existential anxiety and instead focus on our studies and futures as citizens of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But the cost of living, the challenge of owning a home and the spiralling cost of tertiary education makes this task seem daunting and hopeless.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are also expected to remain optimistic about these challenges whilst being the first generation raised in the unregulated social experiment of the digital world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are manipulated by social media algorithms, misinformation campaigns, and online bullying, which greatly influences our outlook and our mental health.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am constantly told that my friends and I are the future of this country, yet parliamentarians' decisions seem to be directed at the voters who determine the next election cycle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I implore you to uphold your responsibility to make policy that ensures our success—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THE" rel="nofollow">
         THE
        </a>
        long-term success of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I urge this Parliament to be bold in taking action on carbon emissions, to create equitable pathways for all young people to achieve their dreams and to not simply allow big tech companies to manipulate every aspect of our lives in the pursuit of profit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My generation has so much hope for the future and so much we can offer this country. Please don't allow our potential go to waste.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Arni. Your words inspire me and I hope all of us to redouble our efforts to leave your generation a better world than we see before us today. I visited all of the year 10s at Nossal High School and they certainly gave us a grilling. They're a great bunch of students.
