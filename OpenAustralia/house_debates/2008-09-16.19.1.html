        <p>
         What I can confirm is that the government does indeed take the issue of intermodal freight services very seriously indeed. Moorebank has been identified as a critical area. Discussions, of course, need to take place with not just my department but the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         and also the state government. We know that we need to get serious about the freight issue and the freight challenges for Sydney. For 12 years this was left untouched, just like other infrastructure issues that were ignored by the former government. We have established
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         to bring together the different tiers of government—federal, state and local—and the private sector to make sure that we can move forward on these challenges, including making sure that we have intermodal facilities so that we can increase the amount of freight that is moved by rail. At the moment, we have had a significant increase in rail freight in terms of east-west; we have had nothing in terms of north-south. It was completely ignored by the former government. This government is determined to get the processes right to work not just with the different tiers of government but with the private sector and with local communities—because local communities know that infrastructure is critical, and part of that is getting freight right.

               I advise the member opposite—he lives in Brisbane—to go and have a look at the literally hundreds of workers today doing work on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
                Ipswich Motorway
               </a>
               . You should go and have a look at Labor’s nation-building agenda in practice on the Ipswich Motorway—something that was ignored by those opposite for 12 years. Such progress is, of course, part of Labor’s tradition as a nation-building party. That is why from day one we moved quickly to establish
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                Infrastructure Australia
               </a>
               to bring together all the different levels of government and the private sector.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Infrastructure Australia provides the way, the Building Australia Fund provides the means—a means to fund investment in roads, in rail, in ports and in broadband. These funds are under threat from a reckless, irresponsible opposition that wants to blow, at a minimum, a $6.2 billion hole in the surplus—an opposition that discarded its leader today but discarded economic responsibility sometime ago. It completely gave up on economic responsibility. I would have thought that the new Leader of the Opposition would understand the importance of our nation-building agenda, because in the past he has had a history of being attracted towards the Labor agenda. It is common knowledge in the Labor Party that the new Leader of the Opposition went to Kirribilli to meet with then Prime Minister Keating about getting the casual vacancy in the Senate for the Labor Party in 1994.

                   will resume his seat. I indicate to him my tolerance about those types of points of order, which are not points of order. I will listen carefully to the conclusion of the minister’s answer.

                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This response from the minister is not in any way relevant to the question, which was about infrastructure.

                      On the point of order, the question went in broad terms to Labor history, which I acknowledge should have been code for being very careful. I will listen to the minister concluding his answer quickly.

                       Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition clearly understood at that time that infrastructure was important. Only Labor could be trusted with the job of building the nation. We have seen a former Labor Party member replaced by someone who wanted to be a Labor senator.
