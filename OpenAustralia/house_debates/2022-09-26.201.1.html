       <p>
        This morning the Albanese government's betrayal of the Australian people was put on display for all to see. The announcement of $50 million for alcohol and drug treatment services is an admission that the abolishment of the cashless debit card will see alcohol and drugs pour back into vulnerable communities. This is an admission from Labor that they are happy to pursue their twisted ideology, even if it risks plunging areas that have struggled with domestic violence and social dysfunction back into chaos. I can assure you it's no laughing matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Always happy to play political games, now Labor are rushing through amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
         CDC
        </a>
        legislation to save face, against the backlash they have received. But it is too little, too late. It is clear the Albanese government prioritises ideology above the needs of at-risk communities. There is no doubt that the cashless debit card has saved lives, helped individuals manage their income and put food back on the table. The minister says she consulted the affected communities prior to the decision to abolish the CDC. Please, Minister, do not disrespect my community of the East Kimberley and please do not take them as fools. It was a Labor Party election commitment in opposition to scrap the CDC. So any consultation was merely window dressing. I think we all can agree on that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inner-city Labor elite may not care about the effects of removing the cashless debit card, but we on this side care about the 17,000 people whose lives may be torn apart as a result of this reckless decision.
