       <p>
        I wish tonight to make a few remarks about the terrible motor vehicle accident which occurred at Cardross, near Mildura, on 18 February this year. It was such a dreadful tragedy, and it has had an incredible impact on the local community. But it has also affected the nation. At the outset can I say that it is not my intention to reflect in any way on pending court actions. I do need you to be comfortable with that, Mr Speaker. I wish only to make a tribute to six young, precious Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not my intention initially to draw attention to the tragedy in this way. There has already been much said and much comment in the media. For the families and friends of these young people I have felt in the last two weeks the need not to intrude on their terrible grief. However, so many people around the precincts of the parliament have expressed their condolences to me. Senators and members from all sides of the political divide have expressed very sincere sympathies, and so have many members of staff of the chambers. I have been very humbled by these very sincere expressions of empathy for the families associated with these young Australians. So in trying to find a way to convey these sentiments to the families and to the friends of these young people I thought it wise to make a short statement to this House which draws together, I believe, those expressions of empathy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted that the Governor-General, His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery, sent a formal letter of condolence the week after the accident. This was delivered to the civic leaders of the Mildura Rural City Council, and was very much appreciated by the whole community. In that way, the Governor-General has spoken for us all. What the Governor-General was expressing was the deep shock that we all felt. All of us think of our own children, and our hearts go out to the parents of these youngsters. The nation has many precious resources, but the most precious of all are our youngsters. To see lives so brutally snuffed out and people denied the realisation of their potential affects us all. Six young people have been lost to the nation; seven others were severely injured, and two of those are still in critical condition in hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to read into the record the names of these youngsters.

        was just 16 years of age. The funeral was conducted on Thursday last week. To Cory’s parent, Rex Dowling, a single parent raising his son, the nation extends enormous sympathy.

        There were two youngsters from one family,
