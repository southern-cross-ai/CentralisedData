        The Higgins Medal is an annual tradition that dates back to 2011, when my predecessor, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_O'Dwyer" rel="nofollow">
         Kelly O'Dwyer
        </a>
        , created an award that recognises the efforts of leading students in my electorate who excel in their studies, extracurricular activities and espoused school values. Over the past 10 years, 209 students have received this award, and it was fitting that Kelly O'Dwyer was the inaugural guest speaker at our very first Higgins Medal alumni event. It was fantastic to hear firsthand the stories of over 100 Higgins Medal winnersâ€”to hear about their goals and aspirations in life and what they've achieved since winning the award.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are the stories of young leaders, such as Naomi Rubenstein, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_School" rel="nofollow">
         King David School
        </a>
        , a young woman who received the award in 2014 following a gruelling hip reconstruction which required significant rehabilitation. She persisted with her studies and commenced a bachelor of science degree. Her hip reconstruction and studies didn't stop her from devoting countless hours volunteering and working for Friendship Circle Australia, which aims to provide every individual with special needs the support, friendship and inclusion they deserve. Naomi has also gone on to a masters in diagnostic radiography so that she can care for patients with acute needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another young woman who shared her inspiring journey is Maya Wimalasundera, a recipient of the award in 2019 from Murrumbeena Primary School. Maya is now studying at Kilvington Grammar School after receiving a scholarship and, along with her family, helps prepare meals as part of the Kilvington Cares meals program. Even though COVID presented challenges to this program, Maya was innovative, delivering support in the form of handmade gifts, cards and baked goods to friends and neighbours during lockdown to help cheer them up, particularly on their birthdays.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another inspiring student was Sarah Marriott. In fact, Sarah, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Catherine's_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Catherine's School
        </a>
        , addressed the event as the inaugural keynote speaker along with Kelly O'Dwyer. Sarah is a dedicated rower, and her amazing efforts, breaking many records for her age, has led to several universities in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        , including Harvard and Stanford, advising her of their rowing programs in the hope that she studies abroad. She has also recently been chosen for a national team. But, more than that, Sarah told us about her struggles with living with type 1 diabetes alongside her love for rowing. She was able to manage the difficulty of having to deal with blood glucose levels and incorporating a significant and elite health and fitness regime in her daily schedule. Sarah shared how she managed her achievements through adversity. I think every student in the room was on the edge of their chair, listening to her story of courage and determination.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so proud of Sarah and all 209 students who are now Higgins Medal alumni and I look forward to the continuing friendship, camaraderie and networking that this significant event will provide to the leaders of Higgins.
