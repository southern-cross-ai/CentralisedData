        More than one in five members in our community volunteer in some form. As this week is National Volunteer Week, I take this opportunity to recognise the valuable role they play in building more resilient and cohesive communities. Last week, I attended an afternoon tea with the Barossa branch of Meals on Wheels to celebrate 50 million meals delivered in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        since the organisation began in 1954.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Meals on Wheels story began in South Australia. It was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        woman by the name of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Doris Taylor
        </a>
        who first saw the need and sought to address it. Doris Taylor was a vigorous campaigner for the aged and disadvantaged. The idea that those who had trouble shopping and cooking could have a hot meal delivered and, as a result, stay in their homes longer was the basis for the organisation that now has spanned more than six decades and delivered more than 50 million meals in South Australia alone. Today the organisation supports some 5,000 clients each year. It does so thanks to its 9,500 volunteers in 90 branches across my proud state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meals on Wheels volunteers are an example of the large and varied army of volunteers, without whom our communities would be much the poorer. I'd like to thank all our generous volunteers for the work they do helping others and strengthening our community. Our community is richer and stronger for your contribution.
