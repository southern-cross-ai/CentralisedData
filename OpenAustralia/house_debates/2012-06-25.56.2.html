        On behalf of the House I want to acknowledge the dreadful tragedy that happened on Thursday last week, when an asylum seeker boat capsized with considerable loss of life. The precise details of this matter still remain unknown but what we do know is that there were likely to be over 200 people on board this boat, including one 13-year-old boy. The boat capsized with considerable loss of life. While survivors were rescued, at this stage we are unable to determine, tragically, how many people have lost their lives in the sea. One hundred and ten survivors have been transferred to authorities on

        </a>
        and a number have been transferred to the mainland for treatment. This is a dreadful human tragedy. I know that members across the parliament would be feeling the weight of that, and we can see many in our community who are grieving from this dreadful news.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should acknowledge the efforts of those who went to the rescue in not easy circumstances. They include our

        personnel; personnel from other agencies; and merchant vessels, who responded to the need for assistance and diverted from their commercial activities in order to be available to help. We should thank them for their efforts. Without them many more people would have died. Today we respectfully and very sincerely acknowledge the lives lost last week.

         I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister, prompted by this latest disaster in the seas to our north. We mourn for the dead; we grieve for the living, who have suffered much; and we offer our support to all the naval and other personnel who have done what they could in the search and rescue effort. If there is anyone to blame in a tragic situation like this, surely it is the people smugglers who prey on desperate people's desire for a better life in Australia. Obviously at a time like this all of us consult our consciences on what is the best course of action to take. I am sure all of us in this House have resolved to put policies in place that will end forever this evil trade.
