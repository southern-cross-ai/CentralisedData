        I rise today to recognise the small businesses at the heart of our communities and to acknowledge the support the Morrison government has delivered to keep them afloat during this time. New economic data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        and Treasury analysis this week show that small businesses will receive $5 billion worth of tax relief this year and next. That's $5 billion back into the pockets of these businesses, seeing the creation of 600,000 new jobs. We've also provided Australian workers who are on $60,000 a year, whether they be teachers or nurses, $6,480 in tax relief. Australians are better off thanks to our government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've welcomed the comments from small businesses in my electorate of Bonner, who couldn't be more thankful for the support that we have provided. Michael Sunderland is the sales manager at Karalis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Estate" rel="nofollow">
         Real Estate
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gravatt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . As it is a small company, with only three full-time staff, things were at their lowest when the pandemic hit. Karalis Real Estate were eligible for our wage subsidy scheme, which, in Michael's words, was a life-saver for his business. As time progressed it was no longer needed. Now they're focused on expansion and growing their team of three full-timers to eight employees by next March.

        In the bayside suburb of Wynnum is Fleur by Ellie, a local florist which opened during COVID. Owner Ellie believes wholeheartedly that our tax relief measures have had widespread benefits in the area. Given the noticeable increase in foot traffic and the return of consumer confidence, Ellie has been able to expand her floristry business with the addition of a new cafe, creating more jobs and more opportunities for locals to go local first.

        There's also Jungle Adventure Play in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Cannon Hill
        </a>
        , the favourite place to be of every local kid, including my two sons. Owner Lachlan Walker opened this business during the June-July school holidays last year. To get on their feet during this time, Jungle Adventure Play took advantage of our government's instant asset write-off. In anticipation of Brisbane's hot summers, they installed air-con units, which has improved the space for children who are busy running around and climbing the equipment. Lachlan mentioned the jungle also has 10 staff taking part in our Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program. They are now able to upskill and train casual apprentices to become part-time or full-time employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just a snapshot of how our government's measures have positively impacted countless businesses and employees in Bonner. With Christmas just around the corner, it's the most important time of the year to be purchasing gifts locally and supporting our mum-and-dad small businesses.
