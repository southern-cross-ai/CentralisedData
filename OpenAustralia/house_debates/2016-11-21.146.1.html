       <p>
        Today I want to bring to the attention of the parliament a petition by local residents in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        on the southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        to the Queensland Department of Main Roads and Transport regarding the need for sound barriers to mitigate noise from the M1. I raise this to acknowledge their very real concerns and to add my voice to their campaigns to have a sound barrier installed along the Somerset Drive off ramp onto the M1 at Mudgeeraba. I thank and recognise Mr Doug Whittaker, who has organised this petition on behalf of the local residents affected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The M1 is of course a vital part of the Gold Coast's transport infrastructure, and I have spoken many times in parliament about the need for further upgrading and improvement of this major motorway. I was delighted earlier this year to help secure federal funding for the upgrade of the M1 from Mudgeeraba to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Varsity Lakes
        </a>
        and to receive advice recently from the Minister for Urban Infrastructure that work is progressing on getting a firm price from market on this section of the upgrade. This is positive news for my constituents, who experience the daily gridlock and delay on this section of the M1.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is also incumbent on the state government to ensure that the amenity of local residents who live nearby is not adversely affected. As the petition points out, the volume of traffic on the M1 has increased significantly since the Glenwood Park estate in Mudgeeraba was built in 1999. This estate runs beside the Somerset Drive off ramp, and the need for a sound barrier is becoming increasingly urgent. The fact is that a precedent has been set regarding the need for noise barriers, with barriers installed on the Somerset Drive on ramp of the M1. I believe it is only fair and reasonable that residents living beside the off ramp are also given the respite that a barrier provides.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the Queensland government to favourably consider this petition and to ensure that the barrier is in place before the planned upgrading occurs. The petition has been presented directly to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions, and I look forward to a favourable response from the minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is understandably something that has a significant impact on the wellbeing and amenity of the residents affected. As I mentioned, the M1 is a crucial transport link, and I will certainly continue to work with local residents and all levels of government for further improvements and upgrades that are increasingly necessary to ensure locals and tourists alike can enjoy living in, working in and visiting our region. I seek leave to table a copy of the petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
