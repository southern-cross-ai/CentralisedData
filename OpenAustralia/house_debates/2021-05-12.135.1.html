        (cf) to commence, by the second anniversary of the commencement of the
        <i>
         Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Act 2021
        </i>
        , a review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of the amendments made by Schedule 1 to that Act; and
       </p>
       <p>
        I have moved the government amendments to the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 as circulated, and I propose an amendment to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 which will require the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        to commence a review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of the amendments made by this bill two years after commencement. This review will further ensure that the amendments are effective in preventing a person from being removed from Australia in breach of non-refoulement obligations and in ensuring that protection claims are always assessed in a protection visa application. The amendments will also enable access to merits review for certain individuals who were previously determined to have engaged protection obligations but in respect of whom the minister has decided that they no longer engage those obligations.
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted in the supplementary explanatory memorandum, the bill is anticipated to operate in relation to the very small cohort of serious character and national security concerned detainees who enliven Australia's non-refoulement obligations. A person will not be subject to removal unless the decision is affirmed on merits review, or the period within which the person may apply for merits review has ended without an application for review having been made, or the person has withdrawn the application for the merits review. I commend the amendments to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill, as amended, agreed to.
