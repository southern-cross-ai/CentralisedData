        I stand in this place today proud to represent the Bwgcolman people and the traditional owners, the Manbarra people, of

        , as they share their journey in their centenary year for the first forced placement of people on Palm Island. There are over 47 language groups on Palm Island. I want to thank the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples for holding a hearing on Palm Island on 3 October.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make it very clear that it was Labor who fought for and won the establishment of this joint select committee. I lobbied hard to ensure that the people on Palm Island also had their voices heard. The evidence presented by Councillor Alf Lacey, mayor; Councillor Roy Prior; Aunty Elizabeth Clay, whose parents lived in the dormitories; Dr Lenora Geia, who was born and raised on Palm Island; and

        people living on Palm Island was sad, hard and painted a picture of strength and resilience.
       </p>
       <p>
        They talked about the elation of the 1967 referendum, but they also talked about the fact that Townsville was one of two cities that voted no in that referendum and how that hurt. Their passion for a process that will enable truth-telling and treaty and constitutional recognition was clearly evident. They acknowledged that all Australians must go on the journey together to achieve a fair and just outcome for First Nations people. I was in awe of their courage, sheer determination, passion and resilience, because their battles have been long, tough and at times very painful.
