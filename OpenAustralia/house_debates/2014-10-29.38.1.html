       <p>
        Today there is change sweeping across my state of Tasmania. Today those in my electorate of Braddon are waking to the news of who will be granted the honour of representing them in local government, and there will be many, many new faces. While there are winners and there are losers, and ballots are still being counted today, the results are becoming clear.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to congratulate the elected mayors of my electorate. Congratulations to Alderman Steve Martin, in the city of Devonport, for an overwhelming win; new mayor Duncan McFie in

       <p>
        As one of the three spheres of government in Australia, local government touches almost all areas of our day-to-day life as citizens whether we live in a city, town or small country area. The role of a councillor is, indeed, a really important one and possibly can hold the key to a successful, thriving community.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the winners, I say congratulations. To those who did not win, thank you for standing. I say to all those who have now been electedâ€”the re-elected and the newly elected councillors: you have a responsibility to work together, to accept that the citizens have spoken. This does not mean that there will not be rigorous debate, but it does mean that there is a group of elected councillors that are expected to work together for the benefit of their municipality.
