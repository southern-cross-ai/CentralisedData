       <p>
        I rise to bring to the attention of the House that the Lyne electorate is receiving record funding under the federal coalition government. In the two years of the Abbott-Truss coalition government, the Lyne electorate has secured tens of millions of dollars in extra funding for the Manning, Gloucester, Hastings and Macleay areas for local roads. This has all been done while addressing significant budget debt and deficit that we inherited. We are increasing funding in well targeted programs that invest in infrastructure and create jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        First of all, in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 budgets, the coalition is investing $1.05 billion to complete the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        upgrade through the Lyne electorate. That is generating 933 direct jobs and 2,900 indirect jobs. The 37-kilometre section will be completed within two years. There is another $2 billion in the upgrade between Kempsey and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        . In total $7 billion is being spent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other funding achievements in the Lyne electorate include the joint health facility in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        courtesy the funds set aside by the Howard government in the Higher Education Endowment Fund that was rebadged and used to fund this wonderful facility for the University of New South Wales Rural Clinical School. It will also be used by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt University
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_University" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle University
        </a>
        . There is $9.6 million allocated from the federal coalition government towards water infrastructure upgrades to the Nabiac aquifer supply system, a backup to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_River" rel="nofollow">
         Manning River
        </a>
        supply system. This will allow a 32½-million-dollar upgrade to proceed finally.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have got the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucketts_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Bucketts Way
        </a>
        upgrade of $16 million, which I fought for in the 2010 and 2013 elections and were coalition commitments before the election. We have $10 million rolled out for the Dyers Crossing and the Dickinson Bridge in the Manning region. The $10 million that I got for the northern gateway that did not go ahead has been rolled over for the Manning Point Road and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Gloucester Road
        </a>
        . We have got an 18½-million-dollar spend by Charles Sturt University courtesy of its regional loading, a legacy of the Anderson-Howard government that the Nationals fought for that gave regional universities with multiple location campuses extra funding. That has all been rolled into this project along with money from the Higher Education Endowment Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have got $18 million of extra Roads to Recovery funding from the coalition government. This is going to change the burden of many local councils. There will be $3.9 million for extra Roads to Recovery in Hastings, $2.85 million for Macleay Valley roads, $3.7 million for the Manning roads and an additional $1.3 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Gloucester Shire
        </a>
        roads. So that is 11½ million dollars to Port Macquarie Hastings council, 7½ million dollars allocation to Kempsey council, $10.8 million to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Taree_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Taree City Council
        </a>
        and $3.7 million allocation to Gloucester Shire council. Overall, that is a total of 33½ million dollars for extra Roads to Recovery money in the Lyne electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have got an expansion of aged care funding, another $10 million. It used to be $90 million a few years ago but with this coalition government we have got an extra $10 million for aged care. We have got $250,000 for the Sporting Schools program. There are 25 schools in my electorate that are getting funds from that. We have got black spot funding for local mobile black spot upgrades. We have got five new or upgraded base stations in the Lyne electorate. Combined with the money from the telcos, that is $3.47 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have got the eagerly awaited upgrade Port Macquarie indoor stadium, with $2.8 million from this coalition government. I had to bring in all my political favours from the Prime Minister and the infrastructure minister to get that money across the line. And that was before we get the benefits of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the jobactive program, workforce subsidies for long-term unemployed young people, Work for the Dole and the Korea and Japan free-trade agreements.
