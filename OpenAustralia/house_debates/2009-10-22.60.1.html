        Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , today representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. My question relates to the 42 asylum seekers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
         SIEV
        </a>
        36. The actions of the 42 asylum seekers are still the subject of police inquiries and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        coronial inquest because police believe the fuel on the vessel was deliberately set alight, killing five people and seriously injuring many on board, including Australian service personnel. Can the minister confirm that permanent residency has been granted to these 42 asylum seekers and that they are not required to report their whereabouts to the department of immigration or any other agency?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. As we know, there were injured passengers on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
          SIEV
         </a>
         36. They have since been discharged from hospital. We also know that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Immigration and Citizenship
         </a>
         had provided visas for those that were on board. This is a very tragic event, of course. This was very difficult for our personnel who were involved. It was a very difficult time for those people on that particular vessel. These matters have been subject to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         coronial inquiry. They have also been subject to investigation by the Northern Territorian police. I am advised that the decision made by the department of immigration in relation to the visas of these people has been made in consultation with the police.
