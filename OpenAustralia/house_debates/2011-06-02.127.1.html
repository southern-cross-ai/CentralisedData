        One of the changes I have seen over the years as the member for Griffith, on Brisbane's Southside, has been the significant investments undertaken by the government in the delivery of local health services. The federal government has now invested $13 million into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenslopes_Private_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Greenslopes Private Hospital
        </a>
        to fund the University of Queensland's new clinical school, providing training infrastructure to support additional medical places, including a state-of-the-art lecture theatre, 14 tutorial rooms and a computer lab.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those of you not familiar with Brisbane's Southside—and I hope the member for Bonner is familiar with Brisbane's Southside—Greenslopes Private Hospital has a proud history. As a military hospital set up in 1942, at the height of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        , the hospital took wounded from battlefronts in the Pacific, Europe,

        . Of the three original bunkers built into the hospital, one of the bunkers still exists today, and it has been turned into a historical museum. My mother was a nurse at this hospital during the war, and part of her job was to nurse back to health wounded Australian diggers returned from

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has also invested $7½ million in the recently opened Prostate Cancer Research Centre at

        , the first of its kind in Australia. Next year Queensland X-Ray Coorparoo will be able to offer a range of bowel, breast and cervical cancer screening through Medicare, providing greater access to

        </a>
        services for patients and allowing local residents to manage their health and keep more money in their back pockets. The government has also injected a $900,000 funding boost to support the expansion of local clinical training placements, with

        Hospital set to benefit. The government is also delivering $176,000 to construct a new maternity and neonatal clinical simulation centre on the site at Mater Health Services and has provided funding for 32 new specialist doctors on the Brisbane Southside as part of an overall investment of $356 million across the country. This builds on the government's recent investments in health services on the Southside. One of the most significant we have seen is the Annerley

        Healthcare run the clinic and the rooms are filling up quickly with nurses, doctors, physios and others keen to improve access to the local community for the range of health services on offer. The government is building 64 GP superclinics around Australia along with an increased investment in GP services to improve access to integrated GP and primary health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the government's other key commitments is to close the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-
