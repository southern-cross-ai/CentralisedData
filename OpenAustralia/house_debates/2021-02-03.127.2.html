       <p>
        I want to speak today about the celebration of selflessness that we conduct each year in my community in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, the northern half of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        . The Local Legends Awards that we put on each year, this year for the seventh time, have now recognised 499 different locals for the extraordinary work that they do in our community to look out for each other and look after each other. When you think about the year that we have all just been through in local communities right around Australia, it has never been more important that we recognise that we are part of a community, that we exist to look out for each other and look after each other, and to recognise that, if anybody is at risk of falling behind, then our responsibility as people, as Australians, as members of communities, is to make sure that we help them along. That is what the Local Legends Awards are all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Typically we get together at Logan diggers, hundreds of supporters, nominees and nominators and a lot of other people, to celebrate the selflessness of our local community. This year that wasn't quite possible because of restrictions. So we made a difficult decision to recognise the 82 people and groups in a slightly different way, and I want to acknowledge them today in the parliament as well. There are too many to mention, obviously—82 this year—but I would mention

       </p>
       <p>
        There are too many to mention in the limited time that I have today, but I acknowledge them all. What these people show is that, when it comes to selflessness and looking after each other and looking out for each other, this is how we roll in Rankin. This is the sort of thing that makes our community such an extraordinary place. We have our share of challenges but we have well over our share of quite amazing people and organisations who are so selfless with their time and do so much to enrich our community, and I want to thank and acknowledge them.
