        A strong Australia is not handed down by big government in Canberra; it's built from individuals who form families as a foundation for community and a strong nation. Each

        , we honour and celebrate those Australians who've taken responsibility for the wellbeing of our communities and our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goldstein is excited to have 15 local residents recognised in this year's Australia Day Awards, including Emeritus Professor Andrew Markus AO, for his distinguished service to tertiary education, particularly in the study of Jewish civilisation, and to multiculturalism; Mr Brian Davis AM, for his significant service to the community through philanthropic support for various community based organisations; Professor Daniel Lubman AM, for his significant service to medical education, research, treatment and policy in the field of addiction; and Mr Daryl Williams AM, for his significant service to the legal profession and to cancer research. Daryl and his wonderful wife, Margaret, are very close friends, and it brought enormous joy to Ryan and me to see him honoured this year—of course, with all others, but sometimes it means something more when it's somebody close to you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other award recipients include the late Mr Rex Brown

Geoffrey, I did get your email. I did have a read, I'm not totally convinced; however, it's good that you're there arguing the case for our democracy and how we make sure that every vote is counted and heard in our democracy

        The remaining award recipients are Mrs Irma Hanner OAM, for her service to the community, particularly through the Jewish Holocaust Centre; Mrs Frances Nicholls

        As we begin a year, it's important to reflect on the sacrifices made by Australians every day for the betterment of our community and our country. They do so without pomp, without ceremony; they do it for what is right. While bureaucrats in Canberra will of course focus on spreadsheets, voluntary interactions between Australians and our local communities are what truly enrich and enhance our social fabric. It's the first stitch in the foundations of a great country. Individuals create a stronger society through their charity by voluntarily applying their labour and effort and innovation to the improvement of their neighbours' lives, and that is what we honour and acknowledge in these awards on Australia Day and the

        and, of course, through many other significant events, such as the recently held Bayside Citizen of the Year ceremony—and I know we have one for

        Individuals create a stronger society through their enterprise by creating new solutions for modern problems. We've seen how the competitive application of medical expertise has stimulated the fastest development of a vaccine in human history. Individuals create a stronger society by accepting responsibility for their own lives and for the lives of their community rather than delegating their responsibility to others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this spirit of common responsibility and sacrifice has been so critically important. Despite the profound economic and social pain, Victorians have persisted through months in lockdown in order to protect the health of their older neighbours. We are back, sadly, at that time again, and may it be the last time.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also seen the success of spontaneous community initiatives in providing essential practical and emotional support to vulnerable Australians, particularly the recently unemployed and the elderly who need mental health assistance and support. If you need resources just to go to Facebook.com/Tim WilsonMP and we have resources there as well. In 2021, let's harness and renew the spirit of responsibility as we build a more resilient Australia.
