       <p>
        I want to thank the hardworking small-business owners and operators that came along to my small-business forum in Tangney to share their feedback not only with me but with the Minister for Small and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Family Business
        </a>
        , the Workplace and Deregulation. We discussed a great range of opinions on many topics, including cutting red tape, training and mentoring opportunities for businesses,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , payroll tax, opportunities for smaller contractors, multinational tax avoidance, local jobs, confidence and superannuation. I'll be sharing this feedback with ministers here in Canberra. I know the opportunity to hear from other small and family businesses and from the minister and to come along and share their views and experiences was very useful. Thank you to those people who took that opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also took the minister to a local business called Joyce Kitchens which operates in my electorate. It is run by Tony Douglass, who employs 30 staff. It manufactures and sells kitchens produced with Australian materials. Tony and Joyce Kitchens have an impressive story to tell about small business success, but they have issues that they're confronting, which I'm working on with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has worked hard to deliver tax cuts for small and family businesses, with the lowest company tax rate in over 50 years. The instant asset write-off for assets up to $20,000 will continue, and we have abolished $5.8 billion worth of red tape, because this government is committed to getting things done for small and family businesses.
