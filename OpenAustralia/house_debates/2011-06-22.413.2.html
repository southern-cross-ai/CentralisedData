         <i>
          'Establishing Medicare Locals and Improving Access to After Hours Care'

         ) Heads of Agreement on National Health Reform, the establishment of Medicare Locals and their role in planning and supporting after hours care provision in their region has been brought forward. Medicare Locals will now be established in three tranches with the first tranche to be operational from 1 July 2011, the second tranche by 1 January 2012 and the remainder by 1 July 2012. As they are established, Medicare Locals will be funded to review the after hour primary care need of their region and to develop and implement a plan to address gaps in after hours care.

         (3) The most recent advice from GP Super Clinic operators for the ten currently opened GP Super Clinics is as follows.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         An additional 28 GP Super Clinics were announced as part of the 2010-11 Budget and will offer an extensive array of primary care services in a single location, with integrated services delivered by teams of health professionals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All of these 28 GP Super Clinics, including hub and spoke model clinics, will offer hours of opening that extend beyond 8am-6pm weekdays and 9am-12 noon Saturdays. Further after hours services provided by the GP Super Clinics will be determined depending on the local needs and priorities of the community, taking into account the availability of existing after hours GP services.
