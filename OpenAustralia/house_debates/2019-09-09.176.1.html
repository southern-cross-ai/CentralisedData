        I want to speak about an event I attended on Saturday afternoon—the Casey District Scout Association annual general meeting. I'd like to pay tribute to the people that were involved in the organisation of this lovely event: Jenny Walden, who is the Casey district commissioner, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Jones
        </a>
        , who is the district scout chairman. We also had the honour of being addressed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Moore" rel="nofollow">

        , the Bays regional commissioner.

        The

         City of Casey
        </a>
        is in a growth corridor, so we have lots of young families living there. The Casey district is a very active district. With the programs and encouragement offered by the Casey District Scout Association, it is district that is getting a lot of young people in. This annual general meeting was attended by the Mayor of the City of Casey, Amanda Stapleton, and also the member for

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wood" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , because we wanted to show that we had bipartisan support for scouting in the City of Casey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay tribute to the young scouts who presented there. A lot is said about what is wrong with young people in our area. But when you see the quality of the presentations made by the young scouts from the Casey district, there should be a lot of credit given to the Casey District Scout Association and the parents—it was a very cold, windy Saturday. Congratulations to the parents who attended that annual general meeting. They should be very proud of their kids, as I was when I watched them.
