       <p>
        In the last two weeks I have had the privilege of attending four openings under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        . One was at Walloon State School, whose principal is Michael Josey. $2.125 million went into a wonderful facility there—a new, upgraded library and a multipurpose hall. I said to the young people there at Walloon State School that it was a slam dunk for Walloon. They got a wonderful basketball court. Walloon, in the country part of my electorate, has never received that sort of assistance for community infrastructure. The facility is used by the local community, not just the P&amp;C, for a range of activities. I commend also the band and the dancers who were there, who were all girls from the school, for their wonderful contribution that day. It is to be celebrated. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

        was celebrated that day recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was celebrated at Grandchester State School as well. Amanda Hines is the principal there. They got $300,000 from the Building the Education Revolution,

        for the 21st Century and National School Pride for a new multipurpose shed, a covered outdoor learning area and playground equipment that is fantastic for the senior primary school aged young people. A good ceremony took place that day. Interestingly enough, it was also attended by the

        member for Lockyer, Mr Ian Rickuss, who was there rejoicing in the BER. I wish some of his colleagues opposite would rejoice in the BER. It was great to see Mr Rickuss there supporting an initiative of the federal Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also I was privileged to attend

        ’s Catholic Primary School in Rosewood. Veronica Lawson is the retiring principal. She is going off to another Catholic school, in Goodna. Veronica spent a number of years at St Brigid’s Catholic Primary School. They named the big multipurpose hall ‘Mercy Place’ after the retiring Sisters of Mercy who had made a contribution for decades after decades to the spiritual, material and community welfare of the people of Rosewood in the rural parts of Ipswich. It is a great school. St Brigid’s

        </a>
        . Father John is a fantastic priest there. I congratulate the school community for getting behind the BER. Interestingly enough, Boss Constructions told me that about 40 people worked on that project; they would not have had jobs but for the BER. It is great to celebrate that, but also there were other upgraded community and school facilities there at Rosewood and St Brigid’s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last weekend I also had the opportunity to do a mobile office at Riverlink, the biggest shopping centre in Ipswich, and people were coming up to me commending us for what we are doing with the BER. The day before, I attended Bundamba State School. Marlene Eltham is the principal and she has turned the school right around. Together with the Queensland Labor government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Schools" rel="nofollow">
         State Schools
        </a>
        of Tomorrow program and the BER, that school has been rebuilt. Academic achievement is up;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        scores are much better; there is barely a piece of paper as litter on the ground; there is great school pride; the kids wear their school uniform—that is what the State Schools of Tomorrow program has done, together with the Building the Education Revolution, in Bundamba.
       </p>
       <p>
        The numbers at Bundamba have increased from 480 children to 558 in the last few months. That is an indication of faith in the school, faith in the school community and faith in the principal. A sum of $3.2 million has been put into that school—a new multipurpose hall, a new science laboratory, a new music building, together with new prep classes and covered areas. These have made a big difference to this school.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what the Building the Education Revolution is about: creating jobs, creating vital community infrastructure; giving kids in rural parts of my electorate and working class kids in the areas around Bundamba and the eastern suburbs every opportunity to achieve everything they want in life. I commend the Gillard Labor government for the Building the Education Revolution. It is making a practical difference to the lives of young people and in the communities and families around Ipswich, particularly with the retention and supporting of jobs in this very difficult time.
