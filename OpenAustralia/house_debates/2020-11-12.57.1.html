        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that last night the government did a deal with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        to allow workers to be sacked or have their hours cut for cheaper workers with a hiring credit?

        <p>
         What I can confirm is that last night the government implemented its plan to get Australians back into work as part of a comprehensive set of measures that were outlined by the Treasurer in this year's budgetâ€”a COVID-19 recession recovery plan set out in our budget, building on the record investments that we have made as a government on behalf of the Australian people to ensure that this nation stands amongst a group of nations small in number that have been able to address not just the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic but the severe blow of the COVID-19 recession that follows. That has been through the unprecedented investment in measures, whether it be JobKeeper, JobSeeker, the JobTrainer fund, the cash-flow boost or the JobMaker hiring credit to get Australians back into work.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will remain committed to putting these measures in place. We have the protections in place to ensure the integrity of these measures support Australians right across the community. We will get on with that job despite the opposition we get from those opposite, despite the undermining we get from those opposite pretending it's some sort of bipartisanship in a pandemic when on every occasion they take the opportunity to undermine and seek to circumvent the record level of support that our government is putting in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians know that this government has their back and they know that Labor has turned its back on them.
