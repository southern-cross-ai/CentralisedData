        Given the debate in recent days, the government can inform the Leader of the Opposition that it would be prepared to provide a facility in the House now for the Leader of the Opposition to (1) provide a copy of the alleged email between Dr

         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am just wondering on what basis the Leader of the House is speaking. Is he speaking on indulgence? Is he moving a motion? Exactly what is he doing in the chamber now?

          Order! He is not moving a motion. I suppose he has taken indulgence, which I am allowing him. He is, hopefully, concluding his statement on indulgence.

                   That was the Treasurer on 4 June. On 15 June, the Treasurer was asked this question:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   I refer the Treasurer to his statement in question time on 4 June that Mr John Grant’s representations in relation to OzCar were referred to Treasury as the responsible agency for this taxpayer funded finance company. Will the Treasurer advise the House what manner of assistance his office requested Treasury officials were to give to Mr Grant?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Mr Swan’s response was as follows:

                  <p class="italic">
                   Mr Grant approached my office. He was referred to a departmental liaison officer who then referred him on to the relevant section of the department. Mr Grant would have received the same assistance as any other car dealer who was referred through that process received.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Treasurer of the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                    Commonwealth of Australia
                   </a>
                   has sought to persuade this House, to create the impression, that Mr Grant’s concerns came through the door in the regular run of business and were just referred in a mechanical way off to the Treasury officials responsible for dealing with them. They were sent off and he was treated like anybody else. There was no special treatment. The Treasurer expressed a complete indifference to—indeed, an ignorance of—what exactly had transpired. And yet we now know the fact that these statements were completely and utterly false.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It turns out, from the emails that have been tendered in the Senate by the Treasury itself, that the case of Mr Grant was raised directly with the Treasury official, Mr Grech, by the Treasurer’s office. And so concerned were they when they raised the matter of Mr Grant on 20 February that they encouraged the Treasury official to raise this matter with
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Credit" rel="nofollow">
                    Ford Credit
                   </a>
                   when the Treasury met with Ford Credit at a prearranged meeting the following Monday, 23 February.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now, that meeting with Ford Credit on 23 February was of enormous significance, because Ford Credit, in common with other finance companies in this industry, were facing very serious financial challenges. They had been struggling, as had others, to raise short-term finance to roll over their commercial paper and they were seeking financial assistance from the Commonwealth government in the order of $500 million—half a billion dollars. This was a matter of the greatest urgency, the greatest necessity, absolutely vital for the continuance of Ford Credit’s operations in Australia. It was at that meeting on 23 February that it was proposed the case of John Grant would be taken up. So not only would the Treasury seek financial support for Mr Grant, this benefactor of the Prime Minister, this provider of a free car to the Prime Minister—who has more cars and planes that one could possibly imagine—but this individual was to have his case raised by the Commonwealth, by the Treasury. That in itself is bringing to bear considerable influence on his behalf. But then the circumstances in which Ford Credit were asked to provide support were circumstances in which Ford Credit knew that it needed to do anything it could, whatever it could, to be agreeable to the government. After all, it was seeking half a billion dollars of financial accommodation from the Federal government.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What do we imagine, what would anyone imagine, went through the minds of the executives of Ford Credit when the Treasury said, ‘Oh, and there’s this chap John Grant; he’s a Kia dealer, he hasn’t been able to get his floor plan rolled over with his existing provider; do you think you’d be able to help him out?’ What are Ford Credit going to do when they are asked that question and told that he is a friend of the Prime Minister’s? They are obviously going to do exactly what they did: spring to attention and seek to render whatever assistance they can. So here we have a case where the considerable influence—and, in fact, leverage—of the Commonwealth government is brought to bear on a finance company that is seeking $500 million of finance, the provision of which is absolutely vital for its survival.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is this man who was not treated any differently to anybody else and in respect of whose affairs the Treasurer professed in this House a complete indifference! Thomas wrote:

                  <p class="italic">
                   … Godwin will also raise John’s case with Ford Credit when he sees them in Melbourne on Monday.

                  <p>
                   Then the email goes on to describe in considerable detail the situation of Mr John Grant, the man of whose affairs the Treasurer told this House he knew nothing; his was just another representation that came through the inbox. Following that email, we had a report from Mr Grech on Friday evening, after the meeting. He says to Andrew Thomas:

                      <p>
                       Thank you, Mr Speaker. The plan was hatched the previous week that Mr Grant’s case would be taken up with
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Credit" rel="nofollow">
                        Ford Credit
                       </a>
                       by Treasury at a time when Ford Credit was dependent, was relying for its own survival as a financing business in Australia to get half a billion dollars from the Commonwealth. In that context of enormous vulnerability, when the influence of the Commonwealth was greater than it could ever be imagined to be in normal circumstances, at that point
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grant" rel="nofollow">
                        John Grant
                       </a>
                       ’s case was raised by the Treasury officials. Then the upshot of the meeting was duly reported that very evening to Mr Swan and to his office and, according to Mr Grech, all went well. Ford Credit have said that they will shut down their business if they cannot get the $500 million. In the context of that, when Ford Credit was as desperate as any business could be for $500 million of Commonwealth money—can we imagine a position where the Commonwealth has greater leverage over any business?—at that point with all of that leverage, with the knowledge, the connivance, the support and the request of the Treasurer, the case of one dealer and one dealer alone is raised with Ford Credit, and who is it? The crony and benefactor of the Prime Minister—John Grant. Nobody else. He is a very special person. That was provided to him.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In the light of all of that, the Treasurer came into this House and said: ‘Mr Grant would have received the same assistance as any other car dealer who was referred through that process received.’ Notice the use of the word ‘would’.

                          It was deliberately designed to create the impression that the Treasurer had no direct knowledge of what had happened to Mr Grant. He did not say that he did receive the same treatment as any other car dealer; he said he ‘would’ have done, as though he did not really know and he just assumed that the normal mechanical bureaucratic processes would have been complied with. That was a calculated deception—calculated to mislead the House and the public—and, until the truth came out, no doubt it was successful.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Then on 4 June he said he had no idea what the outcome of Mr Grant’s representations had been, and yet we have page after page of detailed accounts of who met whom and who rang whom. Even the following week, on 27 February, again in an email sent directly to the Treasurer himself, he is told about the progress of the dealer of whose interests and activities he professed no knowledge at all. The Treasurer is told that:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">

                          on Thursday and they told him that while they are generally concentrating on Ford dealerships … they were prepared to take him on assuming the numbers add up.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And it goes on in considerable detail.

                         <p>
                          What we have here is a shocking abuse of power. We have a Treasurer who has used his considerable influence to get a favour for a mate—and not just any mate, the mate who is a benefactor of the Prime Minister.

                           . That was the dealer in respect of which the government proclaim complete ignorance, yet they desperately seek to raise a distraction from the Treasurer’s situation.

                           Who could imagine any Treasurer surviving—in a government that had any integrity—when he is so manifestly and comprehensively breached the ethical standards? I will quote from the Prime Minister’s ministerial standards:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">

                          <p>
                           The Treasurer has said, ‘No, I don’t have to worry about that.’ He has no concern about that. He says that it is nothing special. Notwithstanding that it is abundantly plain that everything that he has said in this House about John Grant is false, he says that he has no obligation to step down.

                              The Treasurer has sought to use extraordinary leverage to seek an advantage for a mate, and the Prime Minister will not lift a finger against a Treasurer who has so abused his power. It is impossible to imagine any company being more vulnerable and more susceptible to government pressure than

But he does not actually take the action of moving a motion of censure. We have been told that we should resign from our offices because it is such a matter of grave public importance. Yet he comes in here and does not even have the courage to move a motion of censure. Why has he failed to do so? He has had an opportunity today in this debate to produce the email upon which his entire case depends. Where is the email? We are waiting for this email to be produced. Why has he not produced this email? Because the alleged email between my office and the Treasury does not exist. The entire case advanced by the Leader of the Opposition rests on a forgery. This Leader of the Opposition has gone out there and mounted an attack on the Treasurer and me based on a document which is a forgery.

The member for Wentworth is not only not fit to be Leader of the Opposition by his actions in this sordid Turnbull email forgery affair but he has also disqualified himself from ever being fit to serve as leader of this country. Let us be clear about what is at stake here: this fraudulent email is the entire rock upon which the Leader of the Opposition has constructed his case against me, the Treasurer and the government. And this rock has now disintegrated into sand.

May we ask: why are they so desperate to distance themselves from this false and fake email? It goes to the question of the opposition’s active participation in communicating the contents of an email forgery or even worse, which is why the Leader of the Opposition must commit in parliament today to making fully available the opposition’s computer systems and staff to the

It is for these reasons that the Leader of the Opposition has tried in the last 48 hours to run a million miles an hour away from this false email on which he has based his entire case against me, the Treasurer and the government. This is a most serious matter which goes to the integrity of the man who purports to be the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. It goes to the destruction of his credibility in this place, which is why it is no longer tenable for him to occupy the position of Leader of the Opposition.

For weeks he has been talking up this alleged smoking gun to editors around the country. When he raised questions in parliament last week concerning my assurances to the House about any communications between my office and the Treasury on this matter, both he and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition lent across the chamber and began shaking their fingers at Dr Charlton, who sits in the advisers box. That was last Monday. Then we come to the extraordinary events of last Wednesday night, when he sought to threaten Dr Charlton from my office. Dr Charlton then produced a record of conversation.

In other words, there is a third party witness, from the Press Gallery himself, saying that the Leader of the Opposition turned to speak to Dr Charlton—not the reverse. A desperate Leader of the Opposition sought to brief out a contrary version of events through Mr Milne in today’s paper.

                                          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wonder if we can save some time for the House if the opposition realises that the opposition leader was given 20 minutes. What we are after here in moving this motion is for the Prime Minister to be given equal time to the Leader of the Opposition. They might not know that. In terms of the standing orders, all we are after is equal time between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister, which under these circumstances is eminently reasonable, so call it off and get on with it.

What we have seen today is yet further evidence on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and his office to brief out a false account of his attempt to intimidate and threaten my senior economic adviser, not having bothered to take the precaution of consulting a third party source—namely, a senior and respected journalist from the

                                            These are the papers on Saturday morning. We can only assume that the Leader of the Opposition, in claiming now to be totally ignorant of this email, is assuming that Mr Kelly, Mr Coorey and Mr Maher are all liars. I happen to know all three of them. That is not my view. Once again, a tangled web of deceit he has sought to weave, trying on the one hand to maintain his charge against my integrity and the Treasurer’s, based on the existence of this email, and then to run a million miles away from any direct knowledge of it. The bottom line is this: these facts demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt, any reasonable doubt, that the Leader of the Opposition has been fundamentally untruthful with the Australian people on his knowledge of and use of this forged email to serve his political ends.

                                            What checks did we in the government make concerning the accuracy of this email? First, of course, Mr Grant has denied ever having made representations to me on the matter. Second, I know for a fact that I have received no representations from him on this matter. Third, my staff have advised me that they have received no representations from him on this matter. Fourth, my staff have advised me they have made no representations to the Treasury on this matter. Fifth, and most crucially, no record of any such email as that conveyed by the Liberal Party and by the

The Leader of the Opposition has refused to use parliament today to provide this document to the Australian people for authentication. This Leader of the Opposition has, together with his staff, been backgrounding media for weeks, since this matter was first raised more than two weeks ago. They were backgrounding media to say, ‘Here is the smoking gun’—talking it up in the media, saying that there was this direct evidence of a communication from my office to the Treasury in support of Mr Grant. This is what they have been doing all along—except, what they were doing was communicating the contents of a forged document, a fake document, a falsified document.

                                            I would say that the Leader of the Opposition has a fundamental question to answer concerning his integrity. We have given him the opportunity to stand in this place today and to provide the evidence of the existence of this email which he has used to attack the integrity of myself and the Treasurer. The Treasurer’s actions in this entire matter have been entirely professional and appropriate. Those opposite have constructed this farrago of lies based on the existence of this email, based on a proposition that I have provided representations on this matter and caused the Treasurer to act in a particular way. That has been fundamentally demolished, because this email is a complete and utter forgery. The Leader of the Opposition has no option, having raised this matter, called for my resignation, called for the Treasurer’s resignation, to stand in this parliament now, to offer an apology and to—

                                              interjects at this point. I would reflect carefully on what the member for North Sydney himself has said in recent days on this matter as well. It goes to the heart of his integrity and any aspirations he may have to lead the Liberal Party. This Leader of the Opposition has been given the opportunity to come into this House and provide the evidence upon which he has called for my resignation and the Treasurer’s resignation. He has failed to do so. He has no alternative now but to stand up, be man enough to apologise and resign.

                                                         I refer the House to the words of Senator Abetz before the Senate inquiry on Friday: ‘A person, a journalist in fact, has suggested to me that there may have been a communication from the Prime Minister’s office.’ He went on to ask about that communication. He finished by saying, ‘This is what has been suggested to me by somebody, and there is of course the suggestion in today’s media that such a document exists.’ That is point 2. So, firstly, the Prime Minister said that there is no email and that there is no email on the computer system of the government. It now emerges that there are reports that the email exists. That is point 1. Point 2: the report suggests that the email was concocted within the Treasury department. Point 3: the Prime Minister said, with some measure of authority, that somehow he knows, before the Federal Police, that the email is a forgery. Before the Federal Police have completed their investigations, the Prime Minister knows that it is a forgery.

                                                         There is one thing about this whole matter that we will not be distracted from and it is this: the integrity of the Treasurer. The Prime Minister can have the diversion of an email—an alleged email or an email—that is now reported to be real. He can have that distraction, but I will tell you that we are not going to let

I will tell you why: because the Treasurer stated in this place with absolute conviction that Mr Grant was being treated ‘just like everybody else’. He said it was an entirely normal situation the way that Mr Grant was being treated. And he had the audacity to repeat it in an interview with

                                                         Not treated any differently—just a normal run-of-the-mill case. And what is irrefutable is the evidence that has been presented to the Senate by the Treasury. But ironically it was Labor Party senators that tabled the emails—not even the treasury department tabled those emails—that belled the cat in relation to the Treasurer’s lies to this parliament. The truth of the matter is that this all started with our Prime Minister receiving a free motor vehicle from a car dealer. Our Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, was in receipt of a car from

                                                            there was nothing out of the ordinary in the treatment of the man that had given a car to the Prime Minister. Well, I am about to contend that there is something different about

It comes down to the authoritative information that has been presented, not just by the Treasury but also by the Treasurer himself over the last few days. Firstly, how is it just an ordinary occurrence in the treatment of a constituent matter that the Treasurer on one day took a phone call from Mr John Grant—you would believe that in the ordinary course of business the Treasurer speaks to every constituent referral by a member of parliament—but
                                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Ripoll" rel="nofollow">

                                                            rang up the Treasurer and said, ‘I have a real problem with one of my constituents.’ Oh! if we could all have that response from the Treasurer about our constituents. But the Treasurer on this one day—on 20 February—rang up Mr John Grant on the mobile phone. There was a conversation with Mr John Grant. It was a conversation that the Treasurer omitted from his statement in parliament. He was treating Mr Grant as an ordinary person but he omitted to mention a mobile phone conversation with Mr Grant.

                                                            Secondly, on that day Mr Swan, the Treasurer, referred the matter within his office—quite appropriate. It went to

Oh! if we could all have that sort of constituent response from the Treasurer—any Treasurer; we do not mind who the Treasurer is. All this activity on just one day, but Mr Grant is not being treated any differently to any other constituent! Mr Grech contacted Mr Grant and provided feedback on his discussion at 5.19 pm on a Friday. That is pretty efficient from Treasury. And do you know what? Not only does he provide that feedback, at 5.19 pm on a Friday, which is impressive all the same, but the email traffic continues with copies to Mr Thomas, Mr Jim Chalmers, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Treasurer—keen interest in this matter—and Mr Matthew Coghlan, the senior media adviser in the Treasurer’s office. Why did so many people have this interest in an ordinary constituent? Just another ordinary case but yet all these officials seem to have a keen interest! But it did not end there. This was a long day. At 7.27 pm, on a Friday, Mr

The Treasurer was asked in a doorstop, ‘Why was this sent to your home fax?’ and he went on to say: ‘Well, it was not faxed specifically to my home at my request. All sorts of things come to my home fax machine. There can be hundreds of pages of material on the fax. On a rare night in Brisbane it could be out of paper.’

At this point in time—and this is the most telling line—Godwin Grech, from the treasury department, sends an email to the Treasurer at his home, to the chief of staff, to the deputy chief of staff and to the secretary of the treasury department, who now has an interest in this ordinary constituent matter. In that email, the Treasury official states:

Ford Credit had not, at this stage, been able to change the rules. Ford Credit had not been given an indication that they would get half a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money, but here is a Treasury official handing over the mobile phone number of a person who he described as an acquaintance of the Prime Minister and someone whose interests had had the direct involvement of the Treasurer. And Ford Credit were expected to just treat that like any other constituent!

He is expecting us to believe that it is an entirely normal situation to ask a company that is desperate for half a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to help out a mate of the Prime Minister. He expects that is an entirely normal situation. I will tell you what: that is not an entirely normal situation. The best defence this Treasurer can come up with is that the money did not, in the end, come from Ford Credit. The Treasurer has engaged in a conspiracy to murder but there is no body—that is what he is saying—and therefore there is no crime. Well, there is a crime. There are two crimes. Firstly, the Treasurer has misled the Australian people and that is a heinous crime. Secondly, this weak and insipid Treasurer is taking care of the Prime Minister’s mate with taxpayers’ money. That is our contention. The Treasurer has gone too far. The bill for all of this is undoubtedly being paid by the Australian taxpayers.

                                                             How revealing it is that, from the very start of this entire debate, the Prime Minister goes into denial about everything. He is seeking to provide aerial protection for his Treasurer. But I tell you what: we are not going to let the Treasurer off the hook. There are lots of questions that need to be answered. When did you first meet John Grant? It emerges the Treasurer purchased a car from John Grant Motors. It also emerges that there is a little club that John Grant is a member of that provides support to the Labor Party and may even provide support to the Treasurer. There are many questions to be answered, but I want to make this point: it is perfectly clear John Grant received preferential treatment directly as a result of the Treasurer’s involvement. There is now a correspondence trail between the Treasurer and Treasury officials. Of course, the Treasurer said it was only a one-off. Four separate emails go to the Treasurer’s home, and the Treasurer says: ‘I don’t know what happened in that case; I wasn’t informed. It was arms-length.’ What a fool. It is the case that the Treasurer’s bravado has got ahead of him. He is a man who has lied to the Australian people, he has lied to this parliament and the Treasurer now needs to resign.

                                                             <p>
                                                              I think we have just witnessed one of the weakest and most pathetic political attacks ever mounted by an opposition in this parliament. I have spent some time in opposition in this parliament and I have seen some fairly weak attacks, but today just takes the cake. Surely, the Leader of the Opposition must now resign. He has been telling people for weeks that he has the smoking gun. He has been telling senior journalists and senior people in business that he has the smoking gun on the Rudd government. As it turns out, he has been in possession of a fake email. He must pledge today to make available for a police inquiry all of the resources used by the opposition, because it is clear that the grubby opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition knows no bounds.

                                                              The person sitting opposite, there, is supposed to be the alternative leader of this country. That is why he is called the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister. What is he doing in the middle of a global financial crisis where jobs are endangered, where there has been a crisis in car financing earlier this year and where there has been a need for urgent action from the Australian government? What does he do? He is just out there with the mud bucket throwing it everywhere and getting involved in all sorts of conspiracies. Many who have known the Leader of the Opposition also know he has been involved in these sorts of nefarious activities before. He has a history, and I believe that history will now haunt him as the events unfold when we look at the creation, obviously, of a fake email. So the clock is ticking for the Leader of the Opposition. If he cannot provide to this parliament some authentication for this email then surely he must resign, particularly in circumstances where his spokesman and he personally have been telling people about the existence of this email. But of course he is the Captain Smear of Australian politics and he has been throwing it around a lot in the last couple of weeks as we on this side of the House attempt to put in place the fundamental supports for the Australian economy to support jobs. It will be shown to be the case that most of the extreme statements they have been making about the Prime Minister and me are simply false.

Nothing I have done and nothing that has been said by them or anybody else contradicts anything that I have said to the people of Australia in this parliament. I stand by those statements 100 per cent because at the end of the day Mr Grant received no benefit from

We also were confronting a very serious situation where many car dealers were not able to access finance and we took the same steps to help other car dealers that we took in the case of Mr Grant—the same steps. Why did we do this? We did this because jobs were at stake in the community. We did this in an environment where many of the dealers, perhaps half of the dealers in the country, may have been in serious trouble. I will come back to that later on.

                                                              ‘No different’: I will deal with that in a moment. He went on to say:

I suppose they were so lazy when they were in government that they did not use a home fax. They did not have to; they had their weekends off.

Of these emails, around 80 were copied to the Secretary of the Treasury, some 30-odd contained documents specifically for my attention and around 20 related directly to car dealers. Out of all these 130-odd emails sent to my office, only a handful of the emails related to John Grant.

Let me take you back to that time, and Mr Delaney did this very well on the radio this morning. There was a massive threat to car dealerships in this country because

We had decided to set up OzCar, but it had not yet been fully established. And what Mr Grech was simply doing in the case of Mr Grant and others was working as a public servant to put those firms that were already out there with the capacity to fund dealers in contact with dealers who were going to lose their finance. That is what was going on. That email that was referred to before by the shadow Treasurer does at the very beginning refer to the fact that the meeting with Ford Credit had been put in place weeks before the Grant representation had come through. I cannot vouch for everything that Mr Grech was doing but I do know what he was doing in this instance. He was referring dealers who thought that they would not have finance to finance companies that might have provided it. It was standard operating procedure.
                                                                  </p>

At the end of the day Mr Grant did not secure finance from Ford Credit and when I told this House that I did not know what the outcome had been of any of those representations I meant it—I did not know.
                                                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">

The answer is: there are none. The representation was made. It was put in the hands of Mr Grech and he went off and made representations because that was his job—to help car dealers, to set up OzCar, to talk to Ford Credit and to do all of those things that are so important to be done during such a difficult time, because we had to do something for those dealers.
                                                                  </p>

That was a terrific thing. It has meant that the OzCar vehicle is smaller than it was otherwise going to be. But it did mean that we were left with a particular problem with Ford Credit, because their international arm was no longer going to support them. We on this side of the House took the responsible decision to involve them in the special purpose vehicle so that 240-odd dealerships, mostly located in regional and rural Australia, would not go to the wall. This lousy mob opposite is seeking to exploit that action and to somehow say that it was sleazy. Shame on you! What this government has been doing honestly and directly and openly is working to solve a problem to support employment amongst small business in the auto industry.
                                                                  </p>

There was a prospect early this year, upon the withdrawal of those finance companies, that this could have ricocheted right down the supply chain and hit the auto manufacturers themselves. That is what we were looking at earlier this year. So I personally was highly attentive to the needs of the industry. I spent a long time with the Prime Minister in many cabinet meetings and in many working group meetings—in fact some of them went on every day for weeks and weeks and weeks—to see what we could do about supporting this industry. I did spend a lot of time getting regular updates and briefs from officials in the Treasury about the progress of what was going on because I was worried sick that some of these dealerships were going to hit the wall.
                                                                  </p>

You can tell that in their opposition to the stimulus. They do not have a clue about the nature of the economic challenges that have been posed to this country in recent times. It is why they were so opposed to the bank guarantee and the term funding guarantee, which is the single most important decision this government has taken to keep confidence running in our economy. And what did they do to that? It was the same grubby campaign they are running right now. Everybody in this House will remember the grubby campaign on leaked emails run by the Leader of the Opposition against the bank guarantee. It was something that was profoundly destabilising in this country at a very difficult time. He has demonstrated how reckless he is, how irresponsible he is, and now he should resign.

The greatest political crime that a member of this parliament can commit is to mislead this House. A member of parliament can maladminister a portfolio. A member of parliament can squander billions of dollars. A member of parliament can run naked down

Any member of parliament who misleads this House must resign, if he or she has any integrity, or must be forced to resign, if the party leader has any integrity. That is the point here.
                                                                   </p>

That is what this debate was all about. This debate was all about giving the Treasurer an opportunity to come in here and clear this matter up. He could have done that but, no, this Treasurer does not take easily to checks to his political career. We all know what the member for Lilley’s reaction was to losing his seat back in 1996. We know what happened to his office, provided by the taxpayer. We know what happened to his car, provided by the taxpayer. That is what he did when he was confronted with the reality of losing office. Confronted now with the prospect of losing office for misleading this House, he came in here and, as his Prime Minister did, carpet-bombed the integrity of every person who is asking legitimate questions on this matter.
                                                                   </p>

Maybe there have been dozens, maybe there have been a handful, but I suspect that there is just one. Let us not forget that this Treasurer came into the House on 4 June and said:
                                                                   </p>

                                                                   </p>

He did not say it once and have no chance to correct the record. He said it twice, about nine days apart. So, clearly, this is a Treasurer who wanted to let the world know and wanted, most importantly, to let this parliament know that this car dealer,
                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grant" rel="nofollow">

Again, I say to the Treasurer: please tell us how many car dealers you have personally spoken to about their financing arrangements. It is not a vicious, underhand, subversive question. Absent the answer, I am not even accusing the Treasurer of any lack of integrity. I am giving the Treasurer an opportunity to demonstrate his integrity and, most of all, to demonstrate that he has not misled the House because the personal, private phone call that he gave to Mr Grant was exactly the same sort of treatment that he gave to everyone else.
                                                                   </p>

Maybe there are dozens. Maybe there are dozens of car dealers who have had Treasury officers take a direct personal interest. Maybe there are dozens of car dealers who have been the subject of specific, direct representations from the Treasurer’s office. Maybe there are. But, if he wants to put himself in the clear, that is what he has to show. If he wants to demonstrate that he has not misled the parliament, as he seems so clearly to have done, that is what he has to show. It may be that, in discussions between Treasury officials and car finance companies, many, many car dealers have had their problems dealt with at length. Maybe it has happened. But, until the Treasurer has demonstrated that it has happened, clearly Mr Grant has received special treatment. He has received treatment denied to the thousands of other car dealers in this country and to all of the other car dealers who have been making representations, or whose MPs have been making representations, to the Treasurer’s office.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    How many discussions between Treasury officials and finance companies involved those Treasury officials saying to the finance company, ‘This guy is a friend of the Prime Minister?’ Really, how often does this happen? Is this everyday treatment? Is this the kind of thing that the Treasurer does every day? If he does not do it every day, he has misled the parliament. How often do Treasury officials give the mobile phone number of a car dealer to car finance companies and say—wink, wink; nudge, nudge—’If you want half a billion dollars you had better sort this bloke out?’ How often does that happen? It clearly happened in this case because that is what the undisputed evidence to the Senate committee said. So, Treasurer, come into this House and tell us just how often this kind of thing is done. If it is done routinely, fine, your answer is okay. But if in fact there is only one car dealer in the whole country—the good old Kia dealer from Ipswich—who gets this kind of treatment then plainly he has misled the House.
                                                                   </p>

I am sure he has an efficient office; I would like to think he has an efficient office. Certainly, his office was hyper-efficient when it came to the problems of Mr Grant but the fact is this: by no stretch of the imagination is the treatment that the Treasurer’s office accorded to the member for Riverina’s car dealer on a par with the treatment accorded to the Prime Minister’s friend and the person from whom the Treasurer himself bought a car just a few years ago?

I have seen that Mr Grant has said, ‘Friendship is friendship and loyalty is loyalty,’ and I just say this: lying is lying and misleading the House is the worst political offence that a member of parliament can commit, and it has been committed by the Treasurer of this country—unless he can come into this House and explain precisely why what he did for Mr Grant was exactly the same as what he did for everyone else.

Now the fact of the matter is this: I think that the Leader of the Opposition is a very powerful man but he cannot cook up a conspiracy with the Treasury—he cannot alter the Treasury’s computer system. What we are seeing today is a giant smokescreen from a terrified government.

Today the opposition came into this chamber over this issue, which just one working day ago was serious enough to call for the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—something that does not happen every day—and they failed to even move a censure let alone a call for resignation.

There was no ‘chk-chk-boom’ moment from those opposite—none whatsoever. It has just been vicious slur and smear against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this nation—a smear without concern of the consequences for the national interest; a smear that those opposite have walked away from. The member for Dickson took this so seriously that he did a press conference on alcopops while the Leader of the Opposition was speaking on this matter. That is how seriously he took it. He was out there talking about their backflip on alcopops. After having a campaign day after day to run fear on the economy, those opposite had a change of tactics when it was determined that we were not in a recession. For those opposite, it is all about tactics, never about strategy. It is always about the next 24 hours. Their changing of tactics was about personal smear to replace the campaign of economic fear.

Sound familiar? The judge condemned Turnbull’s tactics, saying that his statements to the media had ‘managed effectively to poison the fountain of justice immediately before the commencement of the present proceedings.’ That was Justice Hunt, quoted once again by Annabel Crabb.

It was Friday and the newspaper came out on Saturday. Today, on Sky News, Helen McCabe said, ‘I guess to be completely frank today, we were under the impression that the email existed and under the impression that the opposition had it.’ That is what she said today on Sky News. You had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying today with great clarity, ‘Well, I don’t know that an email doesn’t exist.’ That is her position: ‘I don’t know what I don’t know.’ Yet, this is an issue that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should resign over. This is an issue that should bring down a government. What a farce. When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been dealing with the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s and have been putting Australia in a position to move forward when the rest of the world is moving backwards, I will tell those opposite what their contribution has been: you are a dead weight on the national interest of this country trying to hold us back.

That staff member has written a book. In the book he said—and I ask you to think about the comments between the Leader of the Opposition and Dr Charlton last Wednesday at the press gallery ball: ‘You lied, John. You have got to tell the truth. People could go to jail. Just tell me the truth. It’s so important to tell the truth.’ What were those comments last Wednesday night at the press gallery ball: ‘You have lied, Andrew. Integrity is the most important thing in a man’s career. This could be very damaging for you.’

There is also form on bullying public officials because in 1984, Mr Turnbull launched a legal action against an assistant to the Costigan royal commission asserting the assistant had leaked commission documents to the media. The presiding judge later said that the action launched by Turnbull was a bullying technique designed to put pressure on the official. Justice Hunt said Turnbull’s actions were ‘no more than a ploy’—this is a judge—and ‘clearly enough calculated to prejudice the defendant in his conduct of the present proceedings’. In the judgement, Justice Hunt described Turnbull’s actions as—and I quote from the

He has been exposed by this fake email scandal as a grubby opportunist who will do anything to get into office, just as he would do anything to knock off Peter King, a sitting member from the Liberal Party, just as he would do anything to destroy people in the

He had the majority of the Australian public supporting a republic and he managed to lead the ARM to defeat. They should think about that. They should think about what happened in the internal dynamics of the ARM under his leadership because this is a man who is prepared to put himself first, second and third. This is a man whose only interest is his own interests. He will stop at nothing to gain political power and that is why he deserves to be censured before this parliament today.

The Treasurer outlined quite clearly why there has been no misleading of the parliament. The bottom line of all this is: what did this great mate get? Nothing, not a zack, unlike the mates of the Liberal Party and the National Party year after year, rort after rort, abuse of government process after abuse of government process. The Leader of the Opposition has been exposed for his involvement in a fake email and this is why the Leader of the Opposition should simply resign—because he is unfit for public office, he is unfit to be the alternate Prime Minister of this nation and he is unfit to be the Leader of the Opposition.

This is about the Treasurer misusing his position as the Treasurer of this country—using his ministerial office, using his ministerial staff and directing Treasury officials to provide preferential treatment to a friend of the Prime Minister’s, who year after year after year has given the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, a free vehicle—the registration and all the costs involved. This is thousands and thousands of dollars as a gift to the Prime Minister. So this is about the Treasurer using his ministerial position, his ministerial staff and his ministerial office to direct Treasury officials to give preferential treatment to a mate of the Prime Minister’s.
                                                                       </p>

This is exactly what the former Minister for Defence was accused of doing, and the former Minister for Defence resigned because he had used his ministerial office to direct Defence officials to meet with his brother in order to get preferential treatment.
                                                                       </p>

But the member for Hunter still resigned because he knew that it was an abuse of his position—his ministerial office—to direct a senior Defence official to be in his office to meet with officials that no other constituent would be able to access.
                                                                       </p>

We have needed support in relation to the bank guarantee.’ A number of them told me that they had written to the Treasurer’s office and received no reply. They have sought to get responses from the Treasurer’s office. But, in the case of Mr Grant, all he had to do was telephone the Treasurer and the Treasurer moved heaven and earth, that day, to make sure that Mr Grant’s needs were taken care of.
                                                                       </p>

The member for Hunter was still denying that he had done anything wrong, because he was out blaming the Judases in his midst for his downfall. This is another Labor member with a messiah complex—yet another. They do not even know when they have done something wrong. They are still blaming the Judases for the Messiah’s downfall. This is another example of Labor once more trying to shoot the messenger.
                                                                       </p>

The government senators were trying to suppress evidence to a Senate inquiry by intervening in a most disgraceful way to prevent a Treasury official giving his evidence.
                                                                       </p>

A Senate inquiry was held not because the government wanted to clear the air but because the coalition, with the support of the Greens, was able to get up a Senate inquiry to answer the questions that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister refused to answer in question time. In fact, in the case of the Treasurer, the answers that he gave at the time were manifestly false and he knew it. So we set up a Senate inquiry, and what does the government do? It directs its senators to run interference against a Treasury official who is called to give evidence. That is disgraceful. That is absolutely disgraceful. The government directed a Treasury official to run interference on Mr Grech so that he could not complete his evidence. What kind of transparency is that and what is the government trying to hide?
                                                                       </p>

What is the government seeking to hide? Well, you can get a fair idea of what the government was seeking to hide by the emails that were tabled—and I note this—by the government senators. I think it is passing strange that the Treasury officials did not table emails from Treasury but the government senators did. Government senators having tabled these emails certainly does gives the lie to what the Treasurer said in parliament in answer to questions about

                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p class="italic">
                                                                        I told Grant to keep in touch and to let me know if Ford show concerns or resistance.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        So if Ford shows ‘concerns or resistance’ to the direction from the Treasurer that Mr Grant is to be looked after, what happens then? Well, as Mr Grech says:
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p class="italic">
                                                                        … I will not speak with Ford again on this unless it is absolutely necessary to push it through …
                                                                       </p>

In other words, Mr Grant was going to get access to money, whatever it took. At a time when Ford Credit was seeking half a billion dollars from the government, the Treasurer directed his office and his Treasury officials to make sure Mr Grant got preferential treatment. With this wording:
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p class="italic">

                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        these Treasury officials were in absolutely no doubt at all that the Treasurer was directing them to look after the Prime Minister’s mate. The patronage, the cronyism, the-look-after-your-mates is just so much a part of the Labor DNA that they do not even know when they have done the wrong thing.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        This just goes to show why the Labor Party is running so much of a distraction on this. The fact is that this matter should have been cleared up in the Senate inquiry on Friday. A Senate inquiry was held so that the Treasury official could give evidence. I remind the House that this was the Treasury official who was sent away during Senate estimates to be hidden from the Senate inquiry. These were Treasury officials who were not able to give evidence during Senate estimates, were they Treasurer?

A Senate inquiry was set up, with the support of the Greens—not with the support of the government but with the support of the Greens—so that this Treasury official could give his evidence unimpeded, and yet time and time and time again, the Treasury—

It is my understanding that it is the wish of the House that this debate continue and that that has been agreed by the Leader of the House and the Acting Manager of Opposition Business. That means that after the Deputy Leader of the Opposition’s speech there are four more speakers.

Yet time and time again the government senators, on directions from the leadership team, ran interference to prevent the Treasury official from giving a full answer. Not only did the government senators run interference but so did a Treasury official at the table, to prevent Mr Grech from giving his evidence in full not distorted by the attacks from the government senators. As I was saying, I have just been speaking to some constituents, and I say this to those who might be listening to this debate: how many people who have had a problem that required Treasury attention have received an immediate phone call from the Treasurer? How many people have received action taken that day?

How many times has a Treasury official then gone into bat for that constituent and written the most detailed response back to the Treasurer’s office? But remember this is in the context of the Treasurer saying he knew nothing about this and he had no knowledge of the progress of this. But day after day after day long emails were sent to his home fax detailing all of the representations that had been made on behalf of Mr Grant. Every single nuance—whether Mr Grant was happy, whether Mr Grant was sad, whether Mr Grant had been buoyed by the news or not—is contained in these emails.
                                                                                </p>

The Labor Party do not understand that the level of patronage, of cronyism and of looking after their mates is unacceptable. The member for Hunter had the decency to resign. The Treasurer should resign.

He had flagged a fallback ‘but I will not set that out here, suffice to say it involves Ford Credit’. So this is the plan and this goes to the Treasurer at home. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer was copied in on emails from 20 February, so from the Friday night he was being copied in. Then Mr Grech goes on: ‘I’m meeting Ford Credit in Melbourne on Monday and I will raise Grant’s case.’ That should have caused alarm bells to ring in the Treasurer’s office, that a Treasury official felt—in a prearranged meeting with Ford Credit to discuss Ford Credit’s application for the

They have no understanding of what their level of patronage of cronyism and preferential treatment for their mates is doing to the integrity of this government. Then, on the Monday after Mr Grech had met with them, he gave another detailed response back to the Treasurer and to the Treasurer’s office, pages of emails on what the government now says was just another constituent. The government knows that no other constituent got this kind of treatment. The government knows that it was only the Prime Minister’s mate—who had given him a free car for years and years, who had donated money to him, who was one of his strongest supporters—who received treatment that no other car dealer in Australia received. That is why the government has worked so hard to ensure that the full facts of this case do not come out. If the government has got nothing to hide, why did it run interference in the Senate inquiry? If the government has got nothing to hide, why is it that government senators prevented Mr Grech from giving his evidence in the Senate inquiry on Friday?

On that basis alone the Treasurer should resign. The member for Hunter resigned for a lesser offence than this. The Treasurer should resign. He will continue to bring this government into disrepute for every minute that he stays in the Treasurer’s role. This government has lost its moral compass. This government has lost its way.

                                                                                 </p>

It is hard to think of a more serious accusation that can be made against a Prime Minister or Treasurer than accusations such as these. Accusations of corrupt behaviour in particular are not very common in national politics.

The Leader of the Opposition and his office now have some very interesting questions to answer. They have been pushing this fake email around for weeks and have been promoting its content for weeks, and now they have some very, very tough questions to answer. It is apparent in the opposition’s behaviour in the parliament today that they understand the predicament they are now in. They have not moved a censure motion. Two or three days ago they were asserting corrupt conduct on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and yet they are not moving a censure motion here today. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent most of her speech talking about events of weeks ago that are irrelevant to the current context, and very, very significantly did not even mention the Prime Minister during her opening remarks in her statement about what was wrong with the government.
                                                                                 </p>

I call on the opposition to open up all of their computer resources, all of their backups and allow the Federal Police to examine these matters in the same way that the government has. Just of word of friendly advice—to use a Turnbull-like term—do not go scurrying back to your offices and try to delete emails, guys; I do not think that would be a great idea. I suggest that the opposition think very carefully about your behaviour from here on in because you have made the most extreme assertion that is possible to make against a government and against a Prime Minister—corrupt behaviour—on the basis of virtually zero evidence, and now that evidence has blown up in your face.

Somehow the paths of the Liberal Party and dubious documents, forgeries and information that does not stack up just keep crossing. They keep weaving into the single stream time and time again. We all remember the ‘children overboard’ affair. Another case of Chinese whispers, as they are called, where the gossip, the innuendo, goes round in circles and it gets ever more hysterical, ever more florid, ever more off the point and ever more inaccurate, and then it emerges in public debate as if it were fact when of course it clearly is not. We all remember weapons of mass destruction—not just an effort by the Liberal Party, I hasten to add, but something they embraced enthusiastically without really being too careful to worry about whether there was any factual information to back up the assertions.

It was then later sold to HIH, partly on his advice, for $295 million, and that played a central role in the collapse of HIH and we all know the misery, the loss that that caused around the Australian nation. And in June 2006, as the House will also know, the liquidator of HIH issued legal proceedings against the Leader of the Opposition, claiming, amongst other things, that he had misled the non-executive directors of FAI.

I find that an extraordinary contrast. Accusing the Prime Minister of this country of corrupt behaviour is just about the most extreme, serious accusation the Leader of the Opposition could make. He, by failing to back up this accusation, discredits himself, he discredits the office of Leader of the Opposition and he discredits the Liberal Party and he should resign.

I think both sides of the parliament agree that they are. Events are unfolding in a number of ways outside and inside this building, but we can only deliberate on the evidence that is before us at the moment. I would like to make a couple of suggestions in a moment, but the amendment that we will be asked to vote on is:
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:“that this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for relying on, actively communicating and promoting the contents of a fake email to attack the integrity of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer”.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           I will be required to vote on this. In my view, the Leader of the Opposition has not been able to substantiate that email. There is an opportunity in the House at the moment for the Leader of the Opposition or others in the opposition to substantiate that email or tell the truth to the general public as to the whereabouts of it or why they believe that it exists. The Leader of the Opposition has also suggested on a number of occasions, and the media have definitely propagated the view, that the Leader of the Opposition has actually sighted an email if he does not in fact have it on his person. One of the other things that the general public would like to know is that, if the Leader of the Opposition has sighted an email, where did that occur and who had it in their possession? We need to know those substantive points, otherwise I will have no alternative but to support the amendment before the House.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           </a>
                                                                                           asked the Treasurer if he would abide by the same terms of reference that the Prime Minister gave to the Auditor-General’s office to ascertain some of the facts and figures of the various allegations floating about. I suggest to the House that it would be in the interests of the Treasurer to allow those terms of reference to apply to scrutiny of the Treasurer or his office. That may well have happened within the last hour or so; I am not aware of that. A lot of things are happening out there that people are only just learning about at the moment.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           They are the two things that I would like to bring to this debate. A very serious allegation has been made, partly based on an email that few people have seen, and those who have seen it now doubt the veracity of it. The onus really is on the Leader of the Opposition to substantiate how he came to be in possession of or to witness that particular email and who showed it to him—and there is an onus on the Treasurer to invite the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. Otherwise we will potentially waste a week on this, and I think we all know what the result of this will be, irrespective of the numbers and how the voting will go or what is written in tomorrow’s newspapers. If that email is not presented today, there is no trail of corruption to the Prime Minister. I think it is as simple as that. There may well be some questions that need to be answered by the Treasurer or the Treasurer’s office. As such, I recommend to the government and the Treasurer that, if the terms of reference given to the Auditor-General are good enough for the Prime Minister, they should be good enough for the Treasurer and the Treasurer’s office. This way, the general public may know the substantive facts around what is actually going on here.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           As some would remember, I was involved in a Senate inquiry of some note. We are all aware of the things that can happen by way of government and non-government members trying to shift the position of witnesses giving evidence to Senate inquiries. The mere calling of the public servant to give evidence had a political motivation behind it. Now we have what is being played out in this place, which in effect could waste a whole week when there are many more important issues than this. If the Prime Minister is corrupt, today is the day to take his head off. As yet I have not heard anything to suggest that he is. The Leader of the Opposition has the opportunity to come into the House before question time and produce the evidence against the Prime Minister; otherwise I will have no choice but to vote in favour of the censure motion against the Leader of the Opposition for allegedly using a fake email for political purposes.

                                                                                           </p>

I do not think anyone is going to believe that he had appointments scheduled in his diary between 2 pm and 3.30 pm today. And yet the Leader of the Opposition has gone from the threshold of claiming that this was the biggest possible issue, worth putting his entire credibility on the line for, to coming into the House and moving a motion without using the word ‘censure’. Then, when it comes to the one part of the day when he was scheduled to be in here, he is not here and he can only get one member of his frontbench in the chamber—because the other one is walking out the door as I speak. That is the level of commitment from the Leader of the Opposition and his team to the issue before us today.
                                                                                           </p>

One wonders whether part of the reason for their absence at the moment has something to do with an article that is online on

One wonders about that, but certainly the Leader of the Opposition and his office do have a lot of questions now for themselves, given that there is no doubt that they have been pushing this email around for weeks trying to smear the Prime Minister and trying to smear the Treasurer. The opposition do have to explain when, where and in what circumstances they came in contact with the email. The opposition do have to detail all of their involvement in the creation, distribution and promotion of this email. Remember when the front bench did bother to show up as the opposition earlier today and it was mentioned that they should cooperate fully with the

Each speaker that has come into this debate has had a new argument. They have all tried something slightly different, because whatever argument they put forward then fell over with the next speaker. We had the shadow Treasurer put forward his argument, ‘Oh, it was a pretty fast turnaround,’ only to find the member for Riverina had an 11-minute turnaround. But I reckon one of the best arguments today came from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who claimed last Friday that government senators were suppressing evidence. And what was the crafty device they were using to suppress evidence? The tabling of documents. They were tabling documents as a way of suppressing evidence.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            It might be news for those members opposite, but when you table a document it becomes public. That is the concept of tabling a document. But we now have a question: if they think it is suppressing evidence, maybe that is the way to get them to table the email that they have been pushing to journalists, that they have been arguing that they know all about and then ran a million miles away from. I am not sure whether that was the best line of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is competing with ‘I do not know that an email doesn’t exist’ as a statement of great credibility. But we also have the question: what was it that Senator Abetz was reading, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition used the comment this morning, when asked about Senator Abetz reading the email, ‘It is perfectly legitimate for senators to put information that has been published on the front pages of the newspapers that day regarding the content of an email.’ In a similar vein, on the

There is a problem with the argument. The paper that carried the text of the email was published the next day. While we never doubt the levels of confidence the Leader of the Opposition might hold in himself, I do not know that he holds a similar level of confidence in Senator Abetz, but certainly it is unusual to be able to quote from a paper not yet published. That leaves us with the more likely scenario, which is that the opposition have been in a position to table the email and have chosen not to do so.
                                                                                           </p>

Why else, on Wednesday night last week, would he have said to Dr Charlton, ‘You know and I know there is documentary evidence that you have lied’? It was an extraordinary grubby, bullying tactic to a member of staff, an extraordinary, grubby bullying tactic to go on with—the tactic of a grubby opportunist—but where is the documentary evidence? If he was so sure that he was willing to try to intimidate a member of the staff of the Prime Minister, then table the document, table the email, and provide it now.

It is a big call to make. It is the biggest call a Leader of the Opposition can make. Today is the time for the Leader of the Opposition to put up or shut up. If he believes he has got this evidence, if it is strong enough to say it to the media in a doorstop, if it is strong enough to have the opposition shopping it around to

The National Water Commission insisted that the Australian Rain Corporation give a presentation of this technology to a panel of physicists. They then provided it with the research papers and made the presentation in Russian. The independent review concluded: ‘There is no convincing evidence that the Atlant technology operates as believed by its proponents.’ But in the end the department recommended that the member for Wentworth provide them with $2 million for a trial, which was arguably a generous offering, given what had been said about the technology. What did the Leader of the Opposition, as a minister, do with a recommendation to give them $2 million? He wrote to the Prime Minister seeking a lazy $10 million for the Australian Rain Corporation. You have to ask: what would be the circumstances of taking a departmental recommendation for $2 million and turning it into $10 million? Why would the Leader of the Opposition have done that as a minister?

The same person, the same neighbour, was a member of his electorate fundraising committee, the Wentworth Forum, with membership costing a cool $5,000 to get yourself into the room. If you want to find deals for mates, there are stories of deals for mates and there are stories that rest very squarely with the Leader of the Opposition. This is the same person who was able to run around saying, ‘Well, we’ve got this email. You’d better publish it,’ and who went to members of staff, intimidated them and said that he had documentary evidence. All we ask of the Leader of the Opposition is: prove that you have been telling the truth. We know what will happen. We know we will be greeted with the same deathly silence that we get now. We know that he is pretending to write and focus on something else, but we know full well that the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out and caught out badly.

You can operate in the way that the member for Goldstein operates whenever he thinks there is a whiff of scandal. He just wanders around saying, ‘There are questions that have to be answered.’ That is all he says. The Leader of the Opposition went a big step further, because the Leader of the Opposition decided, on the basis of a fraudulent, fake, email to rest his entire credibility in one call. If there is an allegation against the Prime Minister of Australia and the Treasurer that does not start with that email, then the Leader of the Opposition has not bothered to make it. At every point, the entire case here starts with a single email which is fraudulent and which was the basis of the Leader of the Opposition saying that the Prime Minister of Australia had lied and calling for him to resign. That is the foundation and the starting point of everything that has led to us to this debate today.

I have to say: if there is a censure coming later, that means this is the build-up—this case that they have been running in parliament today is the build-up. Every member of the frontbench has had to come up with a different line of argument, because whatever they just argued fell over, to the point where a minute ago they had run out of frontbenchers who were even willing to speak in the debate. The member for Mackellar was the only one to jump. The member for Mackellar was the only one left to be willing to defend the house of cards that is just falling all around the Leader of the Opposition. There is somebody who deserves to be censured in this place and it is the person who has been willing to discredit and malign and use the politics of smear based on a fraudulent, fake, email with no foundation, and that is the Leader of the Opposition.

But, having said that, those on my right should sit here in silence. This is an important matter and a serious matter and, as I said earlier, 2¾ hours ago, it will not be won by those that shout the loudest. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.

We do not know on what sources he relies to make that claim. For our part, and on the part of everybody concerned in getting to the truth of this matter, we should await the outcome of the AFP investigation. It is not my role or that of the Prime Minister to prejudge that investigation. Indeed to do so would be to risk compromising the investigation, interfering in the proper course of that investigation.

Those are legitimate inquiries. I hear the Manager of Government Business complaining that I said the Prime Minister should resign. Well, I must be the first opposition leader ever to call on the Prime Minister to resign. Gosh, that has never happened before! And by way of correcting the Manager of Government Business, based on the evidence given in the Senate we called on the Prime Minister to either justify his actions or resign.

The Treasurer on the other hand is absolutely damned by the evidence that it is in hand today. The Treasurer should resign. The Prime Minister has to justify why his action does not warrant him resigning.

He was asked: ‘Is the allegation true?’ The reply was: ‘I don’t know but I am going to enjoy watching him deny it.’ It is the oldest political tactic in the book that we have seen from the opposition over the last week. ‘It does not matter if there is no truth to the allegation; it does not matter if there is no evidence; but we will make the allegation and we will watch them deny it. We will throw some mud and we will make it stick. We will throw some allegations and we don’t care if they are true because we do not care about integrity.’

The opposition’s case has had two parts. Firstly, they said the Prime Minister had misled the House and they said that the Prime Minister should resign. They base this on the existence of an email, and we just heard the Leader of the Opposition say, ‘We asked legitimate questions. We said that there were matters to be answered.’ This is what he said:

There was not any such reticence last week when he called for the Prime Minister to resign. Now the opposition are saying that this email is a distraction, the very email they were basing their entire case on last week. They have been running away from this email at a million miles an hour.

We know that it appeared in the paper the next day. I am not much of a gambler, Mr Speaker, and I am not much of a horseracing man, but I might start if I could take Senator Abetz with me. He knows the racing results—

They cannot run a million miles from it because it is on the public record that they placed it on the public record. We have seen dissembling, we have seen manipulation of the facts and we have seen misleading from the opposition. If the opposition really want to clear this matter up, the Leader of the Opposition—he is in his office at the moment—can pick up the phone to the Federal Police and say: ‘Come and have a look at my computers. My office is available. Come right now and have a look at my computers. You can look at any computer in my office and see whether we have, at any time, had possession of the fake and forged email.’

That is what the opposition alleges. But that also does not hold water. We know that because we know, from the public record, that the Treasurer and the government were actively working to assist car dealers across the country. We had the chief executive of the Motor Traders Association yesterday make a public statement and this is what he said:
                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                              That is a pretty definitive statement from Mr Delaney—a statement which shows that the Treasurer and his office were actively working on behalf of car dealers across the country.
                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                              We know there are a range of emails to and from the Treasurer’s office on behalf of car dealers everywhere, on behalf of members of parliament on that side of the chamber and this side of the chamber, because we know that that was a very difficult time for the car-dealing industry in Australia. We know that there were hundreds and thousands of car dealers who were worried about access to finance. Many of them were approaching their local members. Many of them were approaching the Treasurer and his office directly to ask for assistance and the Treasurer was providing that assistance. Some were referred by the member for Riverina. I also discussed the member for Riverina’s cases with her and offered any government assistance that could be provided. Others were referred by other members of parliament. Why? Because there were jobs at stake; because there were car dealers worrying about how they would continue to employ their workers if they could not continue to get access to finance; because the ramifications of car dealers closing their doors on employment in Australia would have been very severe indeed; and because the Treasurer of this country is particularly conscientious when it comes to supporting Australian jobs.
                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                              I have worked as closely with this Treasurer as any member of parliament has and I am singularly unsurprised by the attitude that the Treasurer took. I am singularly unsurprised that he had his office actively trying to assist car dealers from across the country. I am singularly unsurprised that the Treasurer of this country decided it was important to assist car dealers get finance, because the jobs of their employees were relying on it. I am unsurprised because he is a man who cares about the jobs of ordinary Australians; he is a man who actually cares what happens on the street; he is a man who actually cares how people are dealt with; and he is a man who actually takes his responsibility seriously. If a member of parliament, be it the member for Oxley or the member for Riverina, approaches him with a problem, he tries to fix it, because there are jobs at stake.
                                                                                                             </p>

We all remember that there were car dealers who were very, very worried about where they would get their finance from. We all remember that there were employees of car dealers who were very worried about where their bosses and their employers would get their finance from. We all remember that there was concern that car dealers across this country, from one end of the country to the other, would have to close their doors.
                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                              The government had a choice. We could have said: ‘We are going to let the market sort that out. We are not interested.’ We could have said: ‘You are on your own, guys. We are not going to help.’ We could have said: ‘Sorry, there is nothing we can do.’ But we did not say that. We said we would intervene. We said we would establish a special purpose vehicle. We also said we would assist car dealers, where possible, by ensuring that they had access to whatever finance was available. That is what the Treasurer of this country did and he should not be condemned for it; he should be praised for it. He should be thanked for it, because he is a man who actually cares about what happens to ordinary Australians. He is a man who actually came into this place to make a difference and help ordinary working Australians, while you mainly came into this House to take their conditions off them. He is a man who actually believes he can make a difference—and he did.
                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                             <p>

We’re not going to help you, because you have committed the crime of actually knowing a member of parliament. You have committed the crime of actually knowing the Prime Minister of Australia.’ That is what we could have said, but we did not. The Treasurer acted entirely appropriately and has made his position very clear in the House. The Treasurer has outlined what happened and, in each case, it has been accurate. The opposition, so desperate to come back to office, clinging so hard to the born-to-rule mentality, say: ‘We will latch on to any crisis; we will not tell the truth about it; we will exaggerate about it; we will mislead about it; and we will endeavour to engineer a scandal, even though the facts do not support it.’

It is a call for a resignation—the most serious allegation that can be made against a minister of the Crown, an allegation which leads automatically to the resignation of the minister if it is proven. But it is an allegation totally lacking in support; an allegation totally lacking in any corroborating evidence; an allegation based on a fraud, a forgery and a fake; and an allegation that is not based on any objective analysis of the facts.

The leader of the opposition’s role is to hold the government to account and to be ready to serve as the alternative prime minister. It is important that the Leader of the Opposition’s position is taken seriously. It is important that the government and the people can take the Leader of the Opposition at his word. It is important that when the Leader of the Opposition makes an allegation it is taken seriously. The trouble is that from this day forward nothing the Leader of the Opposition says can ever be taken seriously. The trouble with this Leader of the Opposition is that his position is completely untenable and he has no credibility. He could come in here and make allegations tomorrow and the Australian people would rightly say, ‘How can we believe you,

He is prepared to say anything and do anything to take this chair. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to besmirch the reputation of good men and women for his own base political objectives. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to tear down people’s reputations that have been built up over decades in public office because it suits him. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to sell out on morality, to sell out on the truth and to sell out on evidence in order to take his rightful place—in his view—as leader of the government. It is not a position which is credible. It is not a position which the Leader of the Opposition can maintain.

He has failed to tender the email because it is a fake. He has failed to tender the email because he now realises, I would think, that it is a forgery and that his entire political campaign of the last week has been based on a lie. It has been based upon a falsehood; it has been based upon an allegation which cannot be held to be true because it is based on a lie.

He is a man who has sold out on all semblance of credibility, on all semblance of holding to the truth and on all semblance of being a credible alternative prime minister of this country. Instead he has made himself a weapon and a tool of smear and innuendo.

They gave us the mandate to see them through these difficult times. While ever the member for Wentworth occupies that seat the opposition will not be involved in helping ordinary Australians through these very difficult times; they will be involved in smear and innuendo, in grubby politics and in cheap opportunism because that is the epitaph that the Leader of the Opposition has written for himself.

The high dudgeon in fact indicates that perhaps he might feel he is stepping one step closer to being Minister for Finance and Deregulation, and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation one step closer to becoming the Treasurer, because it is the Treasurer who is here to answer the charge that he has misled this parliament.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               There has been much obfuscation about whether the question of the so-called email is the question that has to be answered. The real question to be answered is whether the Treasurer misled the parliament by saying that he had given no special attention to Mr Grant when all the evidence points to the fact that he has so given that special attention. Whilst we have heard a lot of mud being thrown around in this parliament, we should remind ourselves that it was the Treasurer back in 2000 who gave, in a brown paper bag, $1,400 to the Democrats and said there was nothing wrong with that either and that it was perfectly normal practice for political parties to give money to opposing parties. Equally, he is arguing now that there is nothing wrong with him giving special attention to somebody who is a mate of the Prime Minister and possibly even a mate of his.
                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                               The Prime Minister has said he will solve this problem by having the Auditor-General conduct an inquiry. This so-called inquiry is supposed to answer all the questions such that we will then see an end to any question of probity. There are a few things that have to be said about the so-called inquiry by the Auditor-General. I point out that the Auditor-General appeared before a public hearing this morning and he answered a number of questions relating to this so-called inquiry—and I happen to have asked a lot of those questions. The first thing to say is that the Prime Minister has not ordered an inquiry by the Auditor-General. The Prime Minister has written to the Auditor-General and asked the Auditor-General if he will conduct an inquiry—a performance audit—of I am not quite sure what because we did not see the letter. But he said that it is up to him as Auditor-General to decide whether he accepts the request of the Prime Minister to conduct such an audit. He also went on to say, when I asked him what would be the terms of reference, that it was up to him, the Auditor-General, to determine and set the objectives of that inquiry.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               In the course of the public hearing this morning we then went on to discuss how it would be possible to have such an inquiry if there was not power exercised by the Auditor-General to ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to give evidence to that inquiry on oath—to be sworn and give that evidence. It is very important that we understand that the Prime Minister has not ordered an inquiry by the Auditor-General; it is up to the Auditor-General to determine whether he accepts it and then to set the objectives. The objectives must include taking sworn evidence from both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and further they must include that all communications—faxes and indeed emails—between the Treasurer, his office and anybody else where there is supposedly evidence that other people were given the same advantage as Mr Grant must be seen. Because it is the tone of the letter, the tone of the assistance given to Mr Grant, that shows there has been special attention given. Unless we see the other so-called pieces of evidence, which we can then compare with that relating to Mr Grant, we will not have had a proper inquiry at all.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               To questions this morning, the Auditor-General answered that he would consider whether or not he would take evidence from the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. He would not give an undertaking that he would, which, again, causes me great concern. I will end on this point, Madam Deputy Speaker, which is that, in pulling the Auditor-General into this grubby political mire, we are now having a political assurance investigation. This means that the Auditor-General, who has to be like Caesar’s wife and above suspicion, is being pulled into this quagmire of political humbug—the worst that we have ever seen.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>

There is sufficient evidence before the people right now for that to be done. If he wishes to refute it, then we need to see all the correspondence—the emails and faxes—on the public record.
