        I recently attended the

        advisory council meeting. The school is currently transitioning from being a boys only school to a coeducational school and is also transitioning from years 7 to 10 only to years 7 to 12. It is the largest high school in my electorate and will have its first

        candidates next year, in 2016. The school is also undergoing large capital works changes to accommodate the additional students, assisted by a grant from the federal government of over $3 million. The principal, Mr John Finneran, will be leaving the school at the end of the year to take up another opportunity. I want to thank him for his tremendous leadership in leading what is, as I say, the largest high school in my electorate. I very much enjoyed attending the advisory council meeting and look forward to further meetings in the future.

        I would also like to congratulate the Connells Point Rovers on their annual awards ceremony which I attended last Sunday. The Connells Point Rovers Football Club is the largest sporting club in the entire St George region in Sydney. Hundred of families attended the awards at Club Central in Hurstville last Sunday morning. I presented the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards to kids from each of the age divisions between under 6s and under 9sâ€”more than 50 recipients in all. I want to thank the club president,

        , and the club secretary, Luciano Benedet, for the work they do in organising all of the club's activities throughout the year. It is a very large undertaking, because there are some 1,000 people involved in the club. Steve and Luciana do a fantastic job.
       </p>

        I would also like to reflect on the success of the annual Bankstown Children's Festival which was held last Saturday, 12 September. The celebration is a focus on the multicultural community of Sydney. Literally thousands of people attended this event, where there were food stalls and cultural stalls. The highlight of the event was the ceremony at the beginning of the formal proceedings when kids come in in national dress from scores of countries around the world. It brings out community together, and has been doing so for 17 years. This was the 17th annual event. The festival was attended by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hurley" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for his hard work in organising this event. He is a dedicated and selfless servant of Australia and a person who is an inspiration to many, and I thank him for all his efforts.
