        The gospel of Shorten is 'thou shalt put Bill first'. He was elected to serve the people of Maribyrnong. He's now seeking to shaft them for an electorate he can better take for granted. He gave a rolled-gold guarantee that Labor MPs wouldn't resign as dual citizens; they're now signing their resignations. In government he supported tax cuts; in opposition he switched.
