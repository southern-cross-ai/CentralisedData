        I would like to recognise retained firefighter Darrin Atkins. 'Acko', as he is known, is celebrating 32 years of service at Woolgoolga Fire Station 507. He started on 15 June 1988, and has been serving full time since then. He served as deputy captain for over 10 years. He is still a committed first responder, driving fire trucks and protecting our community. Darrin's wife, Lisa, is very proud of him, as is his son, Brock. Their daughter, Bree, sadly died in a car accident 10 years ago. Darrin, as a first responder, was on the way to the accident, but was turned back. Her passing was obviously a devastating loss for the family, as it was for the whole community. His colleagues say Darrin is not only a firefighter, he is also a mentor and a mate to all who serve alongside him. Congratulations, Darrin. I want to thank you for your continued service to our community over many decades.

        I would like to recognise Chief Inspector Nicole Bruce, who was named on this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours_List" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours List
        </a>
        . Nicole received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        for her distinguished service in the police force. Nicole is a highly respected officer within the Richmond police district, and was the first woman to reach the rank of inspector in the northern region. She commenced her career as a probationary constable when she was 19, before moving to general duties at the Botany police station. Nicole then transferred to the Bathurst joint investigation response team in 2002. A year later, she transferred to the Orange Police Station and was promoted to the rank of sergeant. In November 2008, my region got lucky because Inspector Bruce was promoted to the rank of inspector and transferred to the Richmond Local Area Command as a duty officer. She is currently the police district inspector in the Nimbin sector of the Richmond police district. Nicole has distinguished herself in frontline policing, child protection investigation, and

        to achieve significant outcomes. Nicole is also passionate about mentoring junior staff, peers and senior members of the organisation. Congratulations, Nicole, and thank you for your service to our community.
