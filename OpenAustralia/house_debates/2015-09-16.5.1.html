       <p>
        Before I move that the bill now be read a second time, I commend the Treasurer on the bill that he has just presented to this House and his strong leadership of the G20 process that has led to this outcome. It is an outstanding bill and he deserves full credit for bringing that measure to this House. The wheels of government continue to turn, and I think the parade of legislation being seen introduced into the House today and tomorrow and the workings of the House are demonstrating very clearly that this government is getting on with the job and bringing forward the measures that are absolutely essential to secure our nation's economic future as well as securing our nation's future security. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The beneficial new measure introduced by this bill is to exclude the Cost of Living Concession Payment made by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government from being assessed under the social security and veterans' affairs income tests.
       </p>
       <p>
        From September 2015, the South Australian ggovernment is introducing a new Cost of Living Concession Payment, which will replace the South Australian Council Rates Concession, a discount on rates bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new payment will be paid to certain eligible homeowners who previously benefited from the South Australian Council Rates Concession. In addition, the new payment will, for the first time, provide support to certain eligible low-income tenants. The new payment will be a direct annual payment of either $100 or $200 to eligible people, depending on their circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill exempts the new payment from being assessed as income for social security and veterans' entitlements purposes. This ensures people's social security and veterans' affairs income support payments are not affected by receipt of the new payment and, therefore, that they receive the full benefit of the Cost of Living Concession Payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
