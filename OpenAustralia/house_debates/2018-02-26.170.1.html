       <p>
        Last week, on Friday and Saturday, I had the pleasure of a visit from Senator Anne Ruston, the assistant minister for agriculture, to my home town of Kimba. We visited two businesses. In particular today, I want to talk about one—this is a new business—Eyre Premium Hay. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Eyre Peninsula
        </a>
        has never had a hay export industry because it has simply been too far away from a container port; there is not one on the peninsula. Fourteen years ago the Vandeleur family came to Kimba from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clare Valley
        </a>
        with expertise in growing export hay and wanted to establish that business in Kimba. The Vandeleur family recognised that Kimba had a drier climate and so it was a premium quality hay that could extract a premium from the market, and that Kimba in particular was ideally placed as the closest centre to

        , in this case, as it is where the containers go out from.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the advent of the super-high-density bales, we are now able to overload a drop-deck semitrailer—something that we would have always had to underload before. So there are fully loaded trucks. They built a shed 166 metres by 30 metres by eight metres high and installed weighbridges. This shed can store over 10,000 tons of hay on site. It is a $1.7 million investment. It is linked with Balco, the biggest hay exporter in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which brings to the business its reputation and goodwill and the ability to pay farmers on time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a fantastic operation. I congratulate them all.
