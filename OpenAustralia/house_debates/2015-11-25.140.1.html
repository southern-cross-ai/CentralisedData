       <p>
        Christmas is a very special time. It is a time when family and friends come together, it is a time when the community joins together and it is a time when we as members of parliament have a unique opportunity to build on that sense of community. In my electorate the suburb of Belmont is going to take on a unique role this year. Instead of just sitting back and enjoying Christmas the shops in Belmont have decided to join in a competition that I am running and decorate their windows. We are bringing the spirit of Christmas to Belmont, and it starts this Saturday. On Saturday, Councillor Chad Griffith will be hopping on a boat and the 16 Ft Sailing Club will be taking him to the wharf at Belmont. He will hop off that boat and then be piped to the Belmont city centre by the Clan McEwan Pipe Band. Along the way, he will be handing over lollies to children. When he arrives, carols will be sung by a local group. Saturday is going to be a very big day in Belmont. All the children in the area will be able to meet and greet Santa as he arrives. And over the ensuing weeks, when the shops prepare their windows with interesting, bright and festive displays, there will be an opportunity for families to walk around the streets of Belmont and feel that sense of community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is all about building a sense of community. Strong communities come together to enjoy things such as are happening in Belmont. Too often, communities are divided and people are too busy to engage in activities together. But what we are doing in Belmont is building a sense of community by bringing families together and promoting the enjoyment that surrounds Christmas. The children will have the opportunity to be involved at the grassroots level. I put out a challenge to other members of parliament, although I know that in some cases this is not always possible: be part of your community, enjoy your community and undertake activities that will promote the festive season. Along the way, you will help the businesses in your electorate by supporting them.
