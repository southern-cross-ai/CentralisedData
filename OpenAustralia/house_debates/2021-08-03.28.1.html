        In July 2020, tens of thousands of people, including some Labor MPs, marched in Black Lives Matter protests in every major city in this country. Mainstream media defended these people, even claiming that no community transmission of COVID-19 occurred because of the marches. They said it couldn't occur when people were outside. Fast forward to 12 months on: thousands of Australians marched through the country to protest government lockdowns and restrictions and to promote freedom. These people were subsequently vilified in the media and called 'crazy', 'COVID idiots' and 'conspiracy theorists' who had endangered the public. What hypocrisy! It's disgusting to label these people as crazy. These are men and women whose voices are as valid as those of every other Australian. They are men and women who are crying out because lockdowns have pushed them to the brink—ordinary Australians who have lost their jobs, watched their businesses go under or seen their life savings vanish.

        I've heard horror stories firsthand from businesses in my own electorate, particularly those in tourism. These are real people who have had their lives turned upside down. To denigrate them in the public forum is abhorrent. I was vilified for attending a rally in Mackay, where it was completely legal, as were local men and women. They're standing up for freedom but they were called

        non supporters by one taxpayer funded media outlet. They weren't, and I am proud to stand with those people and fight for our freedoms—and I will not hesitate to do so again.
