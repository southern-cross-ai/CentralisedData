        My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. How have the government’s security strategy payments assisted the veterans community?

         I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Some 325,000-plus Veterans’ Affairs pensioners received the one-off payment of $1,400 for singles, and $2,100 for couples, last December. That covered over 100,000 veteran service pensioners, over 90,000 partner service pensioners and over 105,000 war widows. It was a spend of some $400 million, a spend aimed at the vulnerable in our community, a spend aimed at those in the veterans community who have done the hard yards for our country at a time when our country needed it.
        </p>

         There has been an overwhelmingly positive response to these payments within the veterans community. When I have been out and about and also when I have received correspondence, it has been very clear that these payments have been welcome at a time when veterans have really needed them. There is absolutely no doubt about that. There is also plenty of anecdotal evidence of the fact that the money is being spent on the sorts of things that will boost the economy. I will give some examples of the comments that I have received. A veteran from

         said:

         We extend our best wishes that Australia will be able to ride out the storm during this difficult financial situation and that your government can continue its plans for the future.

         A veteran from the seat of Bendigo said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This payment will be most welcome during these uncertain economic times.
        </p>
        <p>
         And from a constituent in Brighton, in the electorate of Goldstein:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The overall action by your government in these uncertain times is very much appreciated, I am sure, by all concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, actually, not quite by all concerned—not by his local member, not by the Leader of the Opposition, not by those on that side of the chamber. There is no doubt that this stimulus package has provided support to those who really need it, and there is no doubt it has actually ameliorated the sorts of impacts that our economy is facing in the current circumstances. Yet the opposition still oppose it or, rather, they jump from one side to the other. The Leader of the Opposition says to the Australian people that he has a plan, a strategy, and that he is a decisive leader. The only thing he is really decisive about is changing his mind. They vote for the package, then they oppose the package. They talk up the economy while, at the same time, they talk down the economy. That is the way they are approaching this debate and the way they approach the current economic situation. There is no doubt that this package has been well received. There is no doubt that it is supported in the general community and there is no doubt that the opposition have to work out what they are really doing on these issues.
