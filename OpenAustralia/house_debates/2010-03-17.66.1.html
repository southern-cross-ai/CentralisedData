        My question is to the Attorney-General, representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Given the Prime Minister has just confirmed that the decision to grant permanent protection visas to the three individuals named in today’s inquiry report was made by the minister’s department, will the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship now use his statutory powers to intervene and revoke the visas?

         The process is that these matters have now been referred to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory Police
         </a>
         , as has been indicated by the Prime Minister. Due process indicates that the police should be able to investigate these very serious matters. As all members are aware, the honourable member who intervened was a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Police Service
         </a>
         . He would understand full well that prejudicial comments with respect to someone facing very serious criminal allegations involving the death of five individuals and serious injury to others may well result in that prosecution being aborted. Indeed, he would be well aware, from cases that he was involved in, of applications being made to set aside jury trials because of prejudicial comments that have been made. In circumstances where three individuals are potentially facing criminal prosecutions as a result of the death of five individuals and the serious injury of others, it is with the greatest respect quite outrageous for politically motivated comments to be made that could potentially prejudice a criminal trial. Having said that, in answer to the question about the role of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, his decisions are obviously matters for him, but he has indicated in the briefing that I have been provided with that after the criminal process takes its course he will unquestionably examine the use of his powers under section 501.
