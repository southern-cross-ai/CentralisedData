          , there was an Auditor-General's report tabled in this parliament, which was startling in its nature. It revealed a Labor Party in government which, knowingly, went out of their way to abuse taxpayers' money for their own political benefit. It was probably the worst

          report that many of the officials in my department have seen. It is a report that highlights just how desperate the former government got in their dying days. It was a government that created a process. Former minister

             Out of 42 recommendations made by her own hand-picked committee, she overturned 34 of them. Of those that the former minister overturned, 80 per cent of them were in coalition seats and 60 per cent were in Labor seats. This is a total and utter abuse of taxpayers' money in a desperate attempt to hold up Labor seats. It was a king's ransom for the Labor Party. And it was not the usual suspects. It was not the member for Grayndler, it was not the member for Sydney; it was the member for Ballarat, who has been totally and utterly silent—

               since this report was released—totally and utterly silent. Unlike the member for Grayndler, who puts out a press release when he turns up to parliament, the member for Ballarat has not said a word. She has not apologised, she has not explained herself, and she should. And if this Leader of the Opposition had any heart he would tell her to apologise. He would tell her to explain. He would tell her to tell the Australian people why it was that the former government, under the Prime Minister he used to support,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
                Julia Gillard

               , did this to Australian taxpayers' money. It was a rort, it is a shame, and you should be disgusted with your own former minister's behaviour. She should apologise.
