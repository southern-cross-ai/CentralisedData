        The Northern Beaches community never ceases to inspire me. The Pittwater not-for-profit Love For Lachie has managed to raise more than $200,000 for children's brain cancer research during its annual charity golf day event. This philanthropic not-for-profit was established in honour of a beloved member of our community Lachlan Muldoon. Lachie is the son of Tanja and Brendan, adoring older brother and friend to many. Lachie fought bravely but lost his battle to an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, the tragic reality is that brain cancer kills more children than any other disease. And this form of cancer kills more people under the age of 40 than any other. The impressive amount of funds raised during this event will go towards three separate clinical trials, which are desperately searching for a cure to this horrible disease. Specifically, the trials will be targeting paediatric brain cancers of the high-grade glioma category, this being the deadliest form of brain cancer in children. Not only will this further the research within the field; but the clinical trials will provide many children Australia-wide with access to the latest trial and treatment options.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Lachie lost his six-month battle with cancer, an impressive legacy lives on and fights against this disease in his name. On behalf of many members of the northern beaches community and cancer patients now able to access leading treatments, I would like to thank the Love for Lachie charity for all their strength and gallant fundraising.
