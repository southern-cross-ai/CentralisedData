        I mentioned in this place in my maiden speech my passion for disability services and that my family has been touched by it and is far stronger for it. In the last eight months as the member for Reid I have had the opportunity to meet some amazing people that work in providing amazing services. Through Bec Howe at Touched by Olivia, through

        at Autism Awareness, I became aware of an organisation called FRANS. They are a disability service provider within my electorate that supports people living with disability and works with them, their families and carers to create goals and develop support and care plans that best meet their needs and ambitions. Some of the services that FRANS run include supported living, community engagement and life skills training, which are programs dedicated to assisting people to lead more independent and fulfilling lives, supporting those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I have had the pleasure of enjoying the product of one of their cooking classes!

        For 30 years FRANS has been providing person centred support programs for people of all ages living with disability. The core principles of FRANS reflect those that we value so highly in Reid, those of diversity, commitment and inclusion. I was very humbled to see the important community work this organisation is involved in, and the tremendous way that FRANS are supporting parents and carers. To all staff at FRANS for the wonderful job they do providing respite care to families who so dramatically need it, I take my hat off to them.
