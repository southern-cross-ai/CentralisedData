        There's been growing concern among residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnybank_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Sunnybank Hills
        </a>
        and Macgregor in my electorate of Moreton that some crimes are on the rise. In fact, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        candidate during the recent election, on one of her rare visits to the electorate, personally towed around Moreton a sign saying that crime was on the rise. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their homes and workplaces, and I would like to commend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Police Service
        </a>
        for their implementation of the southside community safety action plan rolled out to address these concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation Romeo Airtight commenced on 1 June and it consists of high-visibility police patrols and community engagement strategies by South Brisbane District and Operations Support Command. The operation has conducted high-visibility active patrolling and detection and disruption of offences in those suburbs, including at licensed premises, restaurant precincts, local businesses, thoroughfares and residential areas. Mounted police patrols are now commonly seen around the Sunnybank area. I know this because my office is in Sunnybank. I work and eat there, and I've seen these patrols. So far, these tactical operations have made 224 arrests and have conducted 715 street checks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the action plan is to conduct information blitzes around local shopping centres. Tonight will be their third week around the Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre. Police will be in attendance, with members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers" rel="nofollow">
         Crime Stoppers
        </a>
        , to provide information about crime prevention. They'll also be in attendance at the Pinelands shopping centre. Last week, police conducted a meeting at the Kuraby mosque to address issues around safety in the park and the train line beside the mosque, the Beenleigh line. Prior to that there was also a Chinese community safety day at Macgregor.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said at the start, this is a very appropriate response from the Queensland Police Service, who look after Moreton. I know they're passionate about making people in the Sunnybank area feel much safer. However, there is more that can be done by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        Brisbane City Council. I've called on the unelected new mayor to match a commitment I made during the election for an upgrade of the Mains Road pedestrian overpass at Sunnybank. Most importantly, the upgrade would include the installation of security cameras so that we can make sure we catch any criminals in the area. Local police officers have told me that security cameras are an enormous help to law enforcement. They help catch those few bad eggs who do harm in our community. So far, no commitment has been made by the mayor or the local Liberal National Party councillors Steven Huang, Krista Adams, who is the deputy mayor, or Kim Marx. They were happy to play politics during the federal election, but now they've vanished like thieves in the night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor mayoral and council candidates, including my good friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott" rel="nofollow">
         John Prescott
        </a>
        , who is running for Runcorn, have committed to this important safety investment. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        and upgrade are essential. I again call on the LNP lord mayor and Liberal National Party local councillors to step up and fund this essential upgrade of the pedestrian overpass in Sunnybank.
