       <p>
        It's been my great pride and pleasure to be associated with the Morrison government and some of the great decisions that we've made, particularly since the last election. But probably, in my view, the best one they have made was the decision recently to provide $1 million under the advanced manufacturing grants program to Robern Menz to bring back the

        , the iconic confectionary bar that some of the older members in the chamber might remember more than I do. I think it was discontinued in the 1990s.

       <p>
        Robern Menz, an iconic manufacturer in my electorate of Sturt, produces the FruChocâ€”probably the most famous product that they produce. But of course more recently they've started manufacturing the

        to great success and great export success, in particular into the United States and other markets. Now, in partnership with the Morrison government and that grant program, they are going to be making a significant investment into that product line that they've purchased from Nestle so that they can bring modern manufacturing capability to get the sorts of quantities that are going to be required with modern advanced manufacturing technique and capability to bring back the Polly Waffle, bring back the dream that was lost oh-so many decades ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        But thanks to the Morrison government, it is being returned. I can't wait to have my first Polly Waffle. I'm happy to bring 151 and put one on each seat in this chamber when they're hot off the line. I thank Minister Andrews and the government for this exciting investment in my local economy.
