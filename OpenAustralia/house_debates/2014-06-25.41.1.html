       <p>
        rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the extraordinary members of the Barker community who were recognised in the most recent round of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours. This year Barker boasted three recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , one of whom was Mrs Colleen Andrew of Ramco in the Riverland, who received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for services to the community through church and service organisations. Mrs Andrew is a dedicated member of the Saint Thomas More's Parish, which serves Waikerie, Morgan, Ramco, Cadell, Blanchetown and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Reach" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Remarkably, her service stretches back over four decades, and over that long period her community has been richly blessed to have Colleen as a mentor, confidant, leader and role model.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr John 'Giovanni' Bueti of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        was also awarded an OAM for his contribution to a number of community groups in his local area. Mr Bueti, who migrated to Australia in the 1950s from southern Italy, was instrumental in the development of a monument to recognise the contribution of post-war migrants, something which I am very proud to identify with on a personal level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another Mount Gambier Stalwart, Mr Desmond Edward Lattin, was also recognised for his many years of selfless work, perhaps most notably as one of the leading Riding for the Disabled volunteers in Mount Gambier. Mr Lattin has also been actively involved with a number of other groups and organisations, and he was pivotal in the upgrading of the fencing at the historic Rook Walk around Mount Gambier's famous

       </p>
       <p>
        Also featuring on this year's Queen's Birthday honours list was Captain of the Waikere

         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        for longstanding commitment to his community and local brigade.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend these four worthy recipients and thank them for their contributions to their respective communities.
