         I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (2), (3) and (4) be agreed to and that amendment (1) be disagreed to but that amendments be made in place thereof. I therefore suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments (2), (3) and (4) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to then consider amendment (1). I move:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 be agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those amendments amend schedules 2, 4 and 5 of the bill respectively and were proposed by the government in the Senate. A number of these amendments implement recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R3011" rel="nofollow">
          Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008
         </a>
         . These amendments will make a number of changes to schedules 2, 4 and 5, including amending references in the bill to ‘product of a relationship’, the definition of a child, to instead refer to a child of a person within the meaning of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         1975. It will also use the phrase ‘husband or wife or partner’ instead of ‘partner’ as well as the phrase ‘marital or couple relationship’ instead of ‘couple relationship’. This will ensure that the term ‘marital relationship’ is preserved in acts where that term appears.
        </p>
        <p>
         Question agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         I move:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That amendment No. (1) be disagreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senate amendment (1) amends the bill so that schedules 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the bill have retrospective effect from 1 July 2008. As previously raised by the government during the debate in the Senate, this amendment would give rise to significant legal complications which would require complex transitional and consequential amendments. However, such consequential amendments have not been included in Senate amendment (1). Any retrospective operation of the bill would require provision to be made for the Commonwealth to provide just terms compensation in respect of any acquisition of property brought about by the retrospective application of the amendments to ensure that the bill does not involve any impermissible acquisition of property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, Senate amendment (1) would create inconsistencies between commencement of the reforms of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme as well as between the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. This is because the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSS" rel="nofollow">
          PSS
         </a>
         and the

          MSBS
         </a>
         are governed by trust deeds and trust deeds cannot be amended retrospectively. As a consequence, benefits would not be extended to same-sex partners in the PSS and the MSBS from 1 July 2008 as intended by the amendment. For these reasons, I propose that the House should disagree with Senate amendment (1), but to address the substance of the issues which Senate amendment (1) was intended to address the government has proposed alternative amendments to the bill which are set out in the schedule circulated to honourable members.

         by ensuring that any individual who would have been entitled to payment or payments will be compensated fully for any payments lost as a result of the delayed commencement of the bill. They also address the government’s concerns regarding Senate amendment (1) because they do not require the bill to have retrospective effect. The government’s proposed amendments to the bill will provide a mechanism to allow replacement payments to be made to an individual who has lost a superannuation payment or payments because these reforms did not commence on 1 July 2008.

         They will also amend the commencement of part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill, which inserts a definition of ‘de facto partner’ into the Acts Interpretation Act to commence on royal assent. Also, the amendment will make other amendments to commencement dates for certain schedules to the bill, which the government had previously intended to move in the Senate but which it did not move because they were overtaken by the Senate’s approval of the opposition’s amendment. I commend the amendments to the House. I thank all those involved, including the shadow minister, for the passage of these provisions.
