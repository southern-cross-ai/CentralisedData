       <p>
        This government has broken a lot of promises since it was elected, but the biggest promise of all it has broken was its commitment to the Australian people to be an adult government. What we have seen since this government was elected is a Prime Minister who has shown himself to have no judgement and no self control. His only response to every problem that comes over his desk is conflict. He is a bovver boy who throws punches before thinking. He is a Prime Minister who accused the opposition last week of rolling out the red carpet for terrorists and then turned around this week to congratulated us on being responsible and bipartisan.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not the way for an adult government to deal with an important issue like national security. The Australian public deserve better and they expect better of a government on an important issue of this kind. In environment of a heightened security risk, they expect a Prime Minister who thinks before speaking. This is the biggest broken promise that this government has made. Before the last election, the Prime Minister said that the buck would stop with himâ€”
