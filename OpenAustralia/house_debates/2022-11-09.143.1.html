        On 28 September the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        released a $62 billion energy plan to end Queensland's reliance on coal and become the renewable energy capital of the world. However, the Queensland Labor government's lack of planning and forward thinking has seen new infrastructure in the region come to a complete standstill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have previously used my time as the federal member for Flynn to speak about the serious logistical issues that are preventing the use of the port of Gladstone. The former member for Flynn,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_O'Dowd" rel="nofollow">
         Ken O'Dowd
        </a>
        , secured $100 million for the Access to Gladstone Port project back on 3 April 2019 to provide an alternative route for heavy vehicles accessing the port of Gladstone. This has not progressed. The Access to Gladstone Port project is stagnant and planning strategies since 2020—there are four bridges in the Gladstone area that have oversized load and weight restrictions on them. These bridges need to be repaired and present huge logistical problems for the Queensland Labor government's proposed multibillion-dollar alternative and renewal energy projects in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago we saw a 250-tonne energy generator, on its way to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callide_Power_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Callide Power Station
        </a>
        , stranded at the port of Gladstone due to bridges in the region having these oversized load and weight restrictions placed upon them. This generator has now had to be loaded on a barge and taken further up the port to Fishermans Landing. This is a waste of time and resources, and it's even more disappointing that it could have been prevented.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mr Mark Bailey, is asleep at the wheel. He is missing in action. There are still no updates as to how this infrastructure in the region is going to be improved to accommodate the Queensland government's energy plan. On top of this, there have been no critical questions answered about the Queensland Labor government's energy plan. As of 1 November 2022 there are a total of 14 councils and two part-councils that are drought declared. These declarations represent 41.9 per cent of the land area of Queensland. There are also 27 individual drought declared properties and a further eight local government areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Queensland Labor government's plan to build the largest pumped hydro scheme in the world on the world's driest habitable continent makes no logical sense. It was only a few years ago that many dams and storages were at critically low levels. So how can the government possibly guarantee adequate water supply for a pumped hydro-electrical system given there is a 30 per cent evaporation and seepage loss over a 12-month period?
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, Gladstone Area Water Board issued a critical water supply alert to industry at Gladstone around 18 months ago that is still in place. There have been no substantial flows into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Awoonga" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Awoonga
        </a>
        , which is currently at 65 per cent capacity. There is not enough water for agriculture or the production of hydrogen. How can there possibly be enough water for hydroelectricity?
       </p>
       <p>
        I draw your attention to section 100 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        . It says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nor abridge right to use water.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's what it says. In simple terms, this gives the states—and in my argument the Queensland Labor government—the power to approve or disapprove any water infrastructure proposed by the federal government. The Queensland Labor government has rejected billions of dollars of water infrastructure funding offered by previous coalition governments. Furthermore, the current federal Labor government has withdrawn billions of dollars of water infrastructure funding in its October budget, including by not proceeding with the Hells Gate Dam project and many other water infrastructure projects throughout Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of water assets is critical to the future of the agriculture industry in Australia. The Labor Party, both state and federal, has failed to recognise this fact. The Queensland Labor government also plans to transition Queensland's coal-fired power stations into clean energy hubs from 2027. Can they guarantee that enough baseload power will keep supply to the region's industry, keep it moving and keep household lights on?
