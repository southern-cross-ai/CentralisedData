        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government is investing in the infrastructure needed to increase productivity and create local jobs, including in the great electorate of Mallee? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any roadblocks to this success?

         When the regions are strong, so too is our nation. I thank the member for Mallee for his question and for his advocacy for his great electorate. Certainly he knows that the Liberals and Nationals have an ongoing commitment to deliver for regional Australia, especially in regional Victoria. I'm proud to be part of this government, which is driven to deliver for our nation's regions—the home of our farmers, our resources, those food and fibre producers, some of the hardest-working people in Australia. And that's why we on this side turn up every day to fight for the regions so that they can get their fair share, their share of the pie, to fight for hardworking Australians so they can keep more of their money in their pockets, and to fight for the essential services that Australians need, want, demand and expect. When you've got a strong economy, you can build the road, rail and other infrastructure that our country needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also know that not all the best ideas come from Canberra, and that's why, every chance that we get, we're out on the road talking to people and, more importantly, listening to people. I was so pleased to be with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and

          Water Resources

         on our drought tour just the other day, listening to people, making sure that we heard their issues, their concerns. We heard from farmers who are doing it tough in the electorate of the member for Parkes and in the electorate of the member for Maranoa. It's not only the farmers; it's the flow-on effect to the small businesses that do it tough—the machinery and equipment dealers, and the small cafe feeling the pressure, feeling the pinch, as disposable income dries up due to the prolonged dry spell.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're building the infrastructure that our local communities need. We're building for the future, with projects such as $20 million for the Calder and Western highway upgrades, $10 million for upgrading the regional airport at Mildura in the member for Mallee's electorate and $3 million for modernisation of water infrastructure in Victoria's Sunraysia region, near Mildura. These are important projects. But it's also about delivering the sort of local infrastructure that we need in Braddon. There is $400 million for upgrading roads throughout Tasmania, including in the electorate of Braddon, and almost $8 million set aside to upgrade highways. We've invested more than $871,000 in bridge replacements in Braddon. We've invested more than $18 million in Braddon through programs including the Regional Jobs and Investment Package and the Building Better Regions Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compare and contrast this to Labor. Labor is a roadblock to growth. It is a roadblock to building the infrastructure that families, farmers and businesses need in Braddon, in Longman and elsewhere. It's a roadblock to jobs—not just today's jobs but jobs for our children and our children's children. I urge all Australians, especially in Braddon, to consider the risks—
