        Six years ago, my electorate of Lindsay, particularly

        , had no breast care nurses. Today, we have four, and that is thanks to the tremendous efforts of Gai Hawthorn of the Penrith CBD Corporation, as well as the generous people across our community in small business and even community members who have just given so much. We have raised over $300,000, I believe, and $50,000 this year alone, which means that we'll get another breast care nurse very soon. Breast care nurses support not only women with breast cancer but their families as well.

        It was wonderful to have Tracy Bevan come to Penrith again. We're hoping that she becomes an ambassador for Penrith. She has supported, through the

        , our Pink Up Penrith events over the last few years. It has been a wonderful community event. Small businesses are doing their part by both lighting Penrith pink and also giving so generously. I'd like to congratulate everyone involved. Raising around $300,000 is a great effort. I believe we just have to beat Mudgee now. They're fantastic results, and I give my love to everyone suffering from breast cancer in my community.
