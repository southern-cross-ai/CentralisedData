        It's volunteer week, and another good opportunity to recognise the outstanding contribution our volunteers make to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, I had the opportunity to do just that with the first annual Bonner Volunteer Awards. There were many worthy winners, and so many make such a difference in our community. These include Beryl Acton. Beryl has been running sewing workshops and classes at St Bart's Anglican Church at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gravatt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for the past few years. She also offers to do free mending and alteration work for the Hope Chicks, who provide work for vulnerable and disadvantaged women.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicks" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        love her sweetness, patience and cheerfulness. She genuinely loves the women and doesn't ever lecture or judge. She pops in from time to time, regardless of sewing workshops, just to see how everyone is going.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there's John Bettenay. John has been a member of several Queensland Rotary clubs since 1975, and has held various executive committee positions at both club and district levels. He joined the Rotary club of Mount Gravatt in 1996 and has been an active member of the club and its activities in the local area since that time. He has hosted international exchange students, been a member of the board of directors, is current Treasurer for the Mount Gravatt club—a position which he has held for many years—and always supports the club's regular fundraising efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased, again, to be holding the Bonner Volunteer Awards this year. There were four categories this year: youth, adult, senior and group organisations. Nominations have just closed. There are a number of outstanding candidates, and it's been difficult to pick just one winner in each category. I will be holding a presentation ceremony soon. I look forward to meeting the winners and thanking them for the very important service they provide to the community. I also look forward to updating the chamber on these volunteers and sharing their vital contributions to the community.
