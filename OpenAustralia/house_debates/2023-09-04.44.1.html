        I'd like to take this opportunity to remember and commemorate the life of a remarkable woman, Joy Piotrowski, who sadly passed away in August. Joy was not only a former Ryde Citizen of the Year but also a true local legend. Her legacy of selflessness, dedication and unwavering commitment to making Bennelong a better place to live in should serve as an inspiration to us all. Joy's journey in Bennelong began long ago when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Epping Road
        </a>
        was nothing more than a single-lane unsurfaced road. In those early days, the surrounding blocks were orchards, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         North Ryde
        </a>
        was a very different place to what it is today. As the years passed, Joy became a cornerstone of our community. She was a steadfast member of the Macquarie branch of the Labor Party, where her unwavering commitment to Labor values and her community shone brightly. Joy's tenacity remained even in her later years. When many would have chosen to rest, she insisted on participating in election campaigns, even as her eyesight worsened and even if it meant doing so from a wheelchair. Joy's presence and support were felt in countless campaigns throughout the years. I was personally blessed to have her wisdom and unwavering support during council elections, state elections and, most recently, the federal election. Knowing that Joy's final campaign efforts were to help put me in this place and help me win John Howard's seat of Bennelong would have put a smile on her face. Thank you, Joy, for your tireless support of our community.
