        Did you know that strokes can occur at any age, even in children? I found this out recently after meeting an inspiring young local resident in my electorate, 11-year-old Elliott Clayton, whose sister Sophie suffered a stroke nine years ago when she was just four years old. Stroke is one of Australia's biggest killers and a leading cause of disability. As Elliott has become older, it has become his 'passion project' to make more young people and children aware of stroke, including what they can do to save lives. I have pledged to work alongside Elliott on this passion project to ensure more young people and children are aware of the signs of stroke and know what to do. The Stroke Foundation recommends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAST" rel="nofollow">
         FAST
        </a>
        test as an easy way to remember the most common signs of stroke: Check their face. Has their mouth dropped? Check their arms. Can they lift both arms? Check their speech. Is their speech slurred? Do they understand you? And time is critical. If you see any of these signs, call 000 straightaway.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three simple ways residents, schools and businesses can help Elliott and help the community become stroke aware: (1) register to become a FAST hero this Septemberâ€”Stroke Week is from 2 to 8 September; (2) put up a 'Think FAST' stroke poster in your classroom or business; or (3) host a stroke ambassador for a stroke safe talk. By working together we can all be more stroke aware and help save lives. I commend Elliott and his wonderful passion project.
