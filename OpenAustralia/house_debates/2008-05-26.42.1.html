         I think all members of the House, despite some of the rancour in the debate today, would agree that organisations like St Vincent de Paul, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Salvation Army
         </a>
         , Anglicare, you name it, are out there working really hard on behalf of the most disadvantaged Australians. Therefore, we believe that it is important to support those charities where we can. If you look at the competition for the charitable dollar across Australia, it is really hard; and, if you speak with those organisations, many of them are actually doing it very tough when it comes to raising the money they need to keep their operations going.

          I am surprised that those opposite are objecting as if this is some sort of cynical debate about Australia’s charities. These charities do a fantastic job. If you do not support what these charities do, put your hand up. Come on. These charities do a fantastic job. On top of that, if these charities were to suddenly withdraw from the field, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of filling the jobs that they currently do in critical sectors like aged care and caring for the homeless and disadvantaged, frankly, would be huge—leaving aside what is just the basic, decent human thing to do for those people out in the Australian community who need help.
         </p>
         <p>
          Out there in the community, the smart thing to do is to try and do what we can at a practical level to assist in their fundraising efforts. In a small but practical measure, the government has decided to make

            I notice the member for O’Connor finds this objectionable. I find that remarkable. The government proposes to call for expressions of interest from the church and charitable sector and, as a consequence of that, offer
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
             Kirribilli House
            </a>
            in the first year for up to 10 such events to raise funds for those charities. They will not be charged, of course, any rent or associated costs for the actual facilities. It will simply be on a cost basis in terms of running the actual function itself. This is a small but practical measure to use Kirribilli House to support some of our leading national charities in raising a dollar.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I look at those opposite who have interjected during the outlining of this proposal, I find it remarkable that they could be so cynical about a proposal like this when I seem to recall that Kirribilli House was used for other purposes by the previous government—other purposes, I think, associated with party fundraising. I think it would be good if there were a more generous spirit on the part of those opposite. And I have got to say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I was really disappointed in what he had to say before. I do not think it is really him when he stands up and says that the only thing that unites the Liberal Party is hatred—hatred for the Labor Party. I actually think we can do better in this House when it comes to debate. I would have hoped the Liberal Party could unite behind positive policies for the future rather than that sort of, I think, unnecessarily negative observation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government is pleased to offer Kirribilli House for this purpose. We believe that our leading national charities deserve every level of support that can be provided. This is one small but practical measure to assist, and I would urge those opposite to provide it with simple bipartisan support. On that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the
