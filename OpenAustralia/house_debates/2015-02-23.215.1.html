        Today, I rise to share with the House some ideas from the St Kilian's Primary School students. Recently, I met with the student leaders and grade 6 students of St Kilian's Primary School and I asked them what they would do for their school if they were Prime Minister. They said they would like more funding for their school for the music program and more funding for sporting equipment. They believe that all students at the school should have the opportunity to learn an instrument and that their school should have the sporting facilities for all sports, including basketball and tennis. They also said if they were Prime Minister they would improve road safety and road crossings around the school to allow children to get to school easily. When I asked them what they would do for Bendigo if they were Prime Minister, they said that they would like better bike ways and pathways to ensure that people could get to school safely and ride their parks. They also said that they would like more sporting infrastructure like tennis courts and pools, and perhaps even a water park or a splash park. When I asked them what they would do for Australia, their response was clear. They said that they would like no Australian child to be homeless. They called on our government to invest more in homelessness services. These are some of our youngest Australians with strong ideas about what we need to do as a country.
