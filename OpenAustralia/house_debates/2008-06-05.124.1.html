        Football Club. Recently I had the opportunity to attend the 100-year celebration of the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Junior Rugby League Football Club, which was proudly held at Wests Leagues Club in Leumeah.
       </p>
       <p>
        Football was played prior to 1908, but it was played as rugby union. In 1908 the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Junior Rugby League Football Club was established. It has had a very long and proud history in our district. Over the years it has achieved outstanding results. It was part of what was known as the golden age of rugby league. From 1969 to 1983 the Kangaroos reigned supreme as the premier sporting club in our region. They gave their vast army of loyal supporters a sense of pride as they marvelled at the on-field achievements of the Kangaroos. They have left many special and cherished memories in our district that will continue forever.

        â€™ spirit has always involved camaraderie, fair play, a sense of fun and the thrill of the challenge of the competition of rugby league. Our region has produced many fine sporting achievements. The champions produced by the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Junior Rugby League Football Club have been a significant part of all this, with many players being selected over the years to play representative football for

        and Australia and with other players continuing in their chosen sport as sports trainers, coaches and managers. This year the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Junior Rugby League Football Club has 11 teams, ranging from under-sixes to under-15s, and it truly is one of the community based sports clubs in our district.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank everyone who has been associated with this club: officials, supporters, sponsors and in particular people such as the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marsden" rel="nofollow">
         John Marsden
        </a>
        and Mike Semchyshyn, who have held the important positions of president and secretary respectively. Mike has continued his involvement as the deputy chair of Wests in Campbelltown. I also mention club stalwarts like Poppa Evans, who at age 90 is one of the oldest members of the club but still turns up to watch the kids go around. Col Rose and Tony Norton, who are life members of the club, are both retired fellas who played for the club and continue as coach and manager. They still turn up on a weekly basis to produce junior sport for the kids of our region. I had the opportunity to present both those gentlemen with Australian sports achievements awards only recently, for their dedication and commitment to junior rugby league in our district. All those who have contributed over the years to make this club such a wonderful sporting facility within our district should be commended.
