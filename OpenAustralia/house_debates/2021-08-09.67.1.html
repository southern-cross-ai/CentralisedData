        [by video link] My question is to the Prime Minister. The government announced aged-care workers would be fully vaccinated by Easter. It's August. Less than half are fully vaccinated and aged-care facilities across Sydney are in lockdown. Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for failing to deliver on his announcement and vaccinate all aged-care workers by now?

         The government's national vaccination program is the responsibility of the Prime Minister, the

          Minister of Health
         </a>
         and the government. We do take responsibility for rolling out the national vaccine program. And where there are challenges and faults, we correct them and we get on with fixing them, and that is exactly what the government is doing. I'll ask the Minister for Health to add further to the answer.

          I thank the member for Greenway for her question. At this point in time, the latest advice that I have is that there are approximately 275,357 staff across aged-care services and that 257,143 vaccinations have been administered across those 275,000 staff. That includes 156,340, or 56.8 per cent of first doses, amongst those staff and 100,803, or 36.6 per cent second doses.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the advice of, and from discussions that I've had with, Lieutenant General Frewen and his team, every facility in Australia is required to have, and does have, a plan for vaccination. The range of options which have been developed with those facilities includes the following. Firstly, there is self-vaccination, where facilities are conducting that program as a form of inreach.

              who are completed through the variety of programs. That will also include inreach through vaccination service providers—six principal vaccination service providers. Then, thirdly, there's inreach through general practices and what are called Commonwealth vaccination clinics. In addition to that, there are the outreach options of state vaccination clinics, of Commonwealth vaccination clinics, of general practices and of hubs.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of these things are coming together. In addition to that, one of the things which the Prime Minister was able to achieve through his work with the national cabinet was a commitment by national cabinet for the states and territories to produce public health orders to mandate that anybody who wishes to work in an aged-care facility will have to be vaccinated. It's an important initiative, and I thank the states and territories for their cooperation in working with the Prime Minister for that outcome.
