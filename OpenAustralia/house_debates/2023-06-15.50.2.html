        My question is to the Prime Minister. Earlier today, I joined the Prime Minister at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">
         National Museum
        </a>
        for the unveiling of a permanent display of letters exchanged between Mr Walter Mikac and then prime minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        which were instrumental in the decision by Mr Howard to deliver historic gun control reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 28 April, Mr Mikac's wife, Nanette, and his daughters, Alannah and Madeline Mikac, aged six and three, were amongst 35 Australians murdered at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
         Port Arthur
        </a>
        . The Alannah and Madeline Foundation honours their memory and champions the right of children to live free from violence and trauma. Can the Prime Minister update the House on the importance of the foundation and of the permanent display unveiled this morning?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and for joining me today at what was a very moving ceremony. It was my great honour to be the patron, along with past prime ministers, of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation. I want to acknowledge in the gallery today, Walter Mikac AM, the founding patron, the person who took such personal tragedy and turned it into a story which has made Australia a better nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Honourable members: Hear, hear!
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to also acknowledge Walter's partner, Bridget, who joined us this morning; Sarah Davies, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of the foundation; and Greg Sutherland, the chair of the foundation, who are with us today. I spoke with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         this morning. Unfortunately, he wasn't well enough to travel, but the Leader of the Opposition ably filled his position this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
         The letters that we added to our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          National Museum
         </a>
         today tell the story of such a devastating tragedy. The first letter that Water Mikac wrote to the Prime Minister, John Howard, in ordinary blue biro on foolscap paper—it's there for people to see—is one of the most extraordinary things anyone could read in their life. And now people that visit the National Museum will be able to do it. The opening sentence alone I think stands as a monument to the grace and bravery of this truly great Australian that we've just honoured. It said this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To Mr Howard,
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As the person who lost his wife &amp; 2 beautiful daughters at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
          Port Arthur
         </a>
         I am writing to you to give you the strength to ensure no person in Australia ever has to suffer such a loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is pretty remarkable that Mr Mikac wrote to Prime Minister Howard about giving him strength at that time, a bare nine days after losing those three people who he loved more than anyone in the world to this act of unspeakable violence at Port Arthur. Not only did he find the strength to think of others, he tried to make sure in reaching out that no-one would suffer as Mr Mikac had—sharing that strength, encouraging the Prime Minister to act.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to pay tribute to John Howard for the courage and the determination that he showed in that moment of national challenge. Importantly, he had bipartisan support from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
          Kim Beazley
         </a>
         and from the Labor team, which meant that it was possible to go forward. As I did this morning, I want to single out
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">
          Tim Fischer
         </a>
         . Tim is someone I had enormous respect for. I travelled to his home town for his funeral. For Tim, the National Party leader at that time, with the angst and, quite frankly, fury and threats that went on, to stand up as the National Party leader I think puts his place in history—for other things, as well, but for that above anything else his place in history is assured. I know that's felt across the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reforms that were passed have seen the death rate from firearms in this country halve since 1996 at a time when our population has just about doubled and at a time when we wake up too many mornings to news of school shootings and mass murder in the United States of America. The world looks at Australia and looks at those reforms and says, 'That's where we should be.' But it takes political leadership to get there, and John Howard showed it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reforms, though, need to be continued. Just last Friday, the Attorney-General and the Police Ministers Council unanimously agreed to present options for a new national firearms register to be considered by National Cabinet. This is action arising from the tragedy we saw in the Leader of the National Party's electorate, with the murder of two police officers and the neighbour who went to help. It is important we get this done, and premiers and chief ministers are all committed to getting it done. Again, you can only do these hard things with bipartisan support, so that's important as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's important to recognise that arising out of this incredible tragedy that Alannah and Madeline through the foundation—they didn't live long enough, tragically, to know that their dad is a hero not just to them but to all Australians, but he certainly is that. Today, I'm sure I speak on behalf of myself and the Leader of the Opposition to say that it was our great privilege to be present while a hero spoke and give that example to other Australians. You've made a difference, sir, to this country, and we pay tribute to you today and we honour you.
