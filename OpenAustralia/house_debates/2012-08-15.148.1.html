       <p>
        There have been some really good news stories in my electorate this year and I would like to share some of those with you if I may. First and foremost, I would like to congratulate all the successful recipients of T-QUAL Grants in support of their tourism innovation developments. One of those was Spreyton Fresh in my electorate with the creation of an apple orchard experience including an orchard walk and a side redevelopment with a demonstration block to highlight heritage cider apples. Congratulations to Spreyton Fresh. They got $77,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Guy and Eliza of Mount Gnomon Farm, where they are going to have rare breed experiences including a commercial kitchen, gallery and paddock-to-kitchen experience for the—I was going to say very tasty—organic piggery. They have $110,000. Congratulations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        Getaway Holidays for the King Island fine food paddock-to-plate project. They also got $110,000 and that will be an even more enhanced experience than already exists there. Congratulations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Head
        </a>
        Tourism Association for a multilingual digital Stanley interactive heritage trail tour in the beautiful township of Stanley. They got $35,000. Cradle Huts got $52,000 for a feasibility assessment of a guided tented walks product in the Tasmanian national parks. So congratulations to them, and also to the T-QUAL Grants scheme which was $6.7 million in the 2012 round.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate the North West Community Legal Centre on getting $67,000 to link it in Devonport with Circular Head and Smithton, which is in the far north-western end of my electorate, for the creation of an online legal assistance service product which will allow people to use videoconferencing to do their legal conferencing work through the Windarra centre. I reckon that is a fantastic use of online technologies. So congratulations to those recipients, and also to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Head Council
        </a>
        which is one of the point-of-origin areas for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout. They have just received $375,000 to deliver what they call NBN enabled local government services, most especially for web-based videoconferencing so people can do their planning and development applications online.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I come to Tasmania and the National Disability Insurance Scheme targeting young people aged from 15 to 24 in the state. Well done to those people.
