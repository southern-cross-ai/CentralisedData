          n Senate election on 5 April approaches, voters will be asking themselves which team of senators and which party is best placed to provide a strong, united team to represent them in federal parliament. In the last two sitting weeks we have seen, from WA Labor members who are normally invisible, two matters of public importance aimed at distracting WA people from the real issues and begging people to vote Labor.
         </p>
         <p>
          After the last six years of instability in Canberra, when the Labor Party could not govern itself, let alone the country, people are craving a government and a Senate team that will provide the stability that the country needs. While the Liberals have a strong, united team of candidates competing at this election, the same cannot be said of the Labor Party, who, according to a series of media reports around the time their Senate candidates were selected last year, are completely divided, dysfunctional and dominated by deals, with backstabbing amongst union powerbrokers. These are the people who want to represent Labor in Western Australia. These are the people who want to represent WA. An article in the

I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that did not go down well in Belmont.

          on 12 March 2013 entitled: 'Burke looms amid Labor Senate fears' seems to confirm this:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Brian Burke is continuing to cast a shadow over Labor's Senate … Senator Mark Bishop, whose spot is being challenged by former friend and union ally Joe Bullock, said the weekend's State election showed Federal Labor faced "serious structural issues" in WA that "border on the existential".

          In an editorial dated 13 March 2013, the
          <i>
           Australian Financial Review
          </i>
          refers to state Labor MP Peter Watson's complaints:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … "party hacks and union officials" have captured Labor, including for parliamentary pre-selection.
         </p>
         <p>
          It continues:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … as Mr Watson complains, Labor needs more genuine representatives of the community, not labour movement hacks who think they have a God-given right to represent the people.
         </p>
         <p>
          Paul Murray quoted Labor MP Martin Whitely as saying:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is too late to reform WA Labor rules in time to prevent factional self-interest dominating the coming Senate preselection round in WA.
         </p>
         <p>
          This sums it up. Nothing has changed for the Senate election re-run. It is the same Labor candidates from the same WA Labor system who are contesting this election. There does not seem to be much consideration of what the best policies are for WA or which candidate can offer the best representation to the people of WA. It is all about union power.

          The people of Western Australia have a clear choice between the dysfunctional Senate team from Labor and the strong, united Liberal Senate team that is stopping the boats and is moving to repeal the carbon and mining taxes, which are anti-

          taxes. As we have heard in this place many times, and as we will hear again, the WA people will not stand for those taxes; they need to be repealed now, and the only thing stopping that is the Labor Party and the Labor Senate team.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a clear choice for the Western Australian people in two weeks time: to vote for the Liberals—a strong and united standing Senate team.
