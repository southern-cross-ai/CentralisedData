        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. There are 64,000 households that are on electricity hardship in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . New South Wales households on hardship have increased by 82 per cent under Labor's watch. That's nearly 366 households added to electricity hardship in New South Wales every week under Labor. Why is the Albanese government making life harder for Australian families who are already struggling to cope with Labor's cost-of-living crisis?

         I thank the honourable member her for her question but feel obliged to remind her that she voted against bill relief. She voted against coal and gas caps to help the constituents she refers to. She voted against providing rebates to people paying energy bills and small businesses. So, instead of coming in here and asking questions about it, it might have been better if she voted to support those constituents she refers to. That might have been realistic support she could have given to her constituents. She could have actually extended a hand of friendship to the government that was introducing those coal and gas caps, which have been effective, as well as the rebates. Instead, the honourable member is a member of a party which is proposing to introduce the most expensive form of energy available, at $86 billion for one nuclear reactor, and we very much look forward to that debate.
