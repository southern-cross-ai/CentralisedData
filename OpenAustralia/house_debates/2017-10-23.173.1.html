       <p>
        I want to talk about the National School Chaplaincy Program. It was not been funded for 2018, and I want to advocate for funding into 2018. I have a lot of high schools across the electorate of Mallee that would never be able to afford the level of student support services if it were not for the school chaplaincy fund. Increasingly, I have principals coming to me and saying: 'Can you inquire about this? We want to ensure it goes forward for 2018.'
       </p>
       <p>
        We must assist young Australians on the journey of life by having someone in the school body they can talk toâ€”whether it is about dealing with the pressures of body image or dealing with home life, they need someone who is on their side, who is an authority figure and who has the appropriate skills.

        point out to the parliament that I have recently written to the Treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and also to the Minister for Education and Training,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Birmingham
        </a>
        , about this. I believe this is a very important program, particularly in those country schools that do not have enough resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National School Chaplaincy Program is something I'm going to continue to advocate for. It's something that should be delivered. It's something I believe in, and I think standing by our young Australians is something that enjoys support on both sides of the parliament. Having someone you can talk to is so important as you go through the challenges of getting your education.
