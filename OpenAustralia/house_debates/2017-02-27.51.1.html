         OP
        </a>
        score between one and five.    From my visits to the school, I have seen firsthand the sheer passion, determination and enthusiasm for learning from Ms Andrews and her team. Secondly, it is most important for me to acknowledge the students, who, despite bearing the effects of prolonged drought, have still managed to achieve these fantastic results. These results reiterate to me that outcomes are not necessarily tied to money or proximity to cities, but rather are determined by the hardworking people in the schools who make it their mission to encourage young minds to work hard and reap the rewards. The school has asked that I read this message for them:

        The P&amp;C would also specifically like to acknowledge and thank Ms Andrews and her team of fantastic teachers for their contribution to the outstanding result, which has not only been a boost of morale for the school, but for the entire town.
