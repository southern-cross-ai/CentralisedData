       <p>
        Today I want to put on the record the deep feelings of loss on behalf on my constituent,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Alexis Smith
        </a>
        . Alexis has lost her dog Toomba. We might scoff at this and say it is a family pet but, for Alexis, Toomba was her life. It was her independence, it was her ability to get around, it was her ability to come to my office and volunteer, it was her ability to attend university. Toomba was the saving light. As she writes to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I need another mate, my heart is empty. I am going to struggle to study for my exams next week. I cry often and feel lost. Margaret—
       </p>
       <p>
        who is Alexis's sister—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        and I are deeply and truly upset. Toomba is too young! We only got to be soul mates for about 4 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is Toomba so special? Toomba was an assistance disabled dog. Alexis has a severe disability and is in a massively heavy wheelchair. She often complains that in medical terms she should not still be with us and has defied logic and is still alive this day at 46. For her to get around and to be able, she had this amazing dog. I struggle to call Toomba a dog because we often referred to him as a person in our office. Toomba was just there as Alexis says as her soul mate. Toomba picked up things, Toomba protected her, Toomba answered the phone, Toomba opened the door. Toomba could even turn on the computer in my office. This was an amazing dog and we are all sad that she has gone but we want to pay thanks to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistance_Dogs" rel="nofollow">
         Assistance Dogs
        </a>
        of Australia who provided this amazing creature that made the life of Alexis that much better.
