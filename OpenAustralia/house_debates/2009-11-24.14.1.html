        My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his pre-election commitment:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you are serious about building the 21
        <sup>
         st
        </sup>
        century economy in Australia you have got to build the infrastructure for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also refer him to the October report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Business Council of Australia
        </a>
        which revealed that only 14 per cent of the government’s $96 billion stimulus spend has been set aside for vital economic infrastructure. How does the Prime Minister justify this reckless and wasteful spending and does this low priority that he has given to infrastructure assets not represent just another broken election promise?

        <p>
         Here we have the National Party campaigning against the rollout of infrastructure across the nation—the rolling out of roads across National Party electorates, the rolling out of rail infrastructure across the nation, the enhancement of ports across the nation, the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate contained within this parliament. I really wonder what planet the National Party sometimes lives on because it is completely detached from what their constituents are saying.
        </p>
        <p>
         Buried within that question from the Leader of the National Party is the following: that the expenditure currently going to the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate represented in this parliament is not wanted. Is that what the Leader of the National Party is saying? Is that what the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         is saying? He does not want any funding for any school in his electorate? He is hiding in his papers. Is that what he is saying? Is there anyone over there from the National Party interested in funding for their schools? I ask myself why is it that my good friend and colleague here, the Minister for Infrastructure—a term which was missing from the vocabulary of those opposite for their 12 years in office—constantly gets representations from National Party members about more to be done. I am looking at the Minister for Education—truckloads of correspondence; is there any from National Party members?

          <p>
           There are truckloads. How can you just stand at the despatch box and say ‘It is a terrible waste to invest in this infrastructure’ on the one hand and then on the other write to the ministers responsible and say ‘Give us more.’? I do not understand. How do you get away with this? How do you square up when you try to do this? The member for New England is appropriately gesticulating. There is a certain detachment from reality on the part of the National Party.

                    Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The member for Sturt can thank those on my right—he got out of a warning because they carried on. The Prime Minister will refer to members by their names but I suggest to people who feel provoked into making interjections that that provocation does not justify them ignoring standing order 65B. It would assist if they sat there in silence. The Prime Minister has the call.

                           I just say to the House what I have said before. The problem here is that we have a tradition that answers are allowed to be debated and these sorts of rhetorical questions are by way of debate. I think that is the problem. I suggest to people that they might just—and this will get me into trouble with those on my right—ignore those type of questions. The Prime Minister has the call.

                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                             Western Australia
                            </a>
                            about infrastructure. Before I go back to the Cooroy to Kurra road, is it the WA Liberal government which is now partnering with us in an infrastructure development at Oakajee? Is it the WA Liberal government which is partnering with us in an expansion of the Ord? Is it the WA government which is partnering with the Australian government in the inner city rail bridge at Northbridge? I think in all three of those cases the answer is yes. And a WA member rises in sensitivity!

                                 The member for Mallee will resume his seat. The point that I was simply making was that, so far, the House has not wanted to address the rules of engagement for question time. I simply put it to you that, if the same rules applied to answers as apply to questions, that would even the playing field. It would mean that some of the allowances that are made for argument in questions would not be allowed as often. That is what I was suggesting.

                                  When it comes to the member for Mallee, should I mention the Horsham Town Hall? That is something which the member for Mallee has been keen to receive investment in, through the agency of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and

                                  , in order to assist with that project of, I believe, some millions—a project whose opening, the launch of the project, I believe the honourable member was very happy to attend. The reason I raise this with the member for Mallee, other National Party members, the member for Canning, representing, as he does, the interests of the WA Liberals, and others who are here is to point to one central point on infrastructure investment. It is called hypocrisy. They are in here saying, ‘Isn’t this a terrible thing for the Australian government to be investing in the infrastructure needs of the nation and the regions and localities?’ on the one hand, and in their electorates, in their constituencies, they are doing everything they can to roll it in at the same time.
