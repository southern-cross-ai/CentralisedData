        This is a place of robust debate, apparently. While there is often disagreement on opposing sides of this House, we could all agree that we live in the greatest country on earth. Thoroughly undeserving, I am blessed to live in and represent in this parliament the greatest part of the greatest country on earth: the

        of Sydney. The Northern Beaches community is not one of apathy or helplessness. We are a community of lifters, not leaners. When we see something which needs fixing, we do not expect others to fix it; we roll up our sleeves, get involved, volunteer and help make our community a better place. We pay 50 per cent more personal income tax than the average electorate. A recent community survey showed that 50 per cent of my community actively volunteers. This is 40 per cent higher than the national average. My community gives so much and asks for so little.

        I represent a community of champions.

        Congratulations to the mighty Narraweena Hawks on their volunteer grant. Founded in 1956 and with over 200 players today, the Narraweena Hawks are one of the biggest and oldest rugby league clubs on the Northern Beaches. The benefits of sport to our young people are clear and the Hawks are worthy recipients. The volunteer grant will provide support to cover necessary hiring costs, training costs and the purchase of major appliances. Congratulations to the president, David Mastroianni, and the Narraweena Hawks.

        My electorate is home to one of the largest Tibetan communities in Australia, with over 2,000 local Tibetans. The Tibetan Community of Australia, New South Wales, provides much support and their grant will help in the purchase of computer equipment and will assist with other costs. Congratulations to the president,

        Each year, under the Turnbull government's Local Sporting Champions program, I am able to present 36 $500 grants to elite junior sports people to help them and their family cover the cost of them travelling to and competing at a sporting event. In the last six months, I have presented 22 of these grants and, at Champions of Mackellar, I was proud to be able to recognise Mia Rolfe, an upcoming swimmer, Nanki Soin, an ascendant sport climber, and Liam Spinks, an elite junior baseball player. Congratulations, Mia, Nanki and Liam.

        In mid-May, I called for nominations from my community for my inaugural Champions of Mackellar award. I was inundated with over 100 nominations. When poring over all nominations, there was one particular nomination which stood out, not because you would read about it in the paper but because you would not. Our Champion of Mackellar is a volunteer for Easylink, which is a not-for-profit community service keeping the vulnerable and potentially isolated connected. Working from a run list, our champion routinely picks up an average of 15 passengers from their homes, plans a scenic drive, arranges a picnic afternoon tea, and then returns them home. Our champion is committed to building the capacity of Easylink for the benefit of customers and others. Congratulations
