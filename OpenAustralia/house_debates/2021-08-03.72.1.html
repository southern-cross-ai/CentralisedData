        . Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is creating a stronger Australia by enhancing national security to keep all Australians safe?

         I thank the member for his question. I acknowledge his strong interest in national security and the work that he has done to make sure that Australians are safe and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know that COVID-19 is not the only challenge to our safety and security in a rapidly changing world, the world in which we now live. That's why our government is making sure that our national security agencies have the resources and the legislative powers to protect Australia's critical infrastructure, our businesses, our families and, indeed, our way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over successive budgets, we've delivered record funding to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         , the ACIC and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
          AUSTRAC
         </a>
         . Importantly, we're also ensuring that they have the legislative backing that they need to make real gains in the fight on crime, on organised crime, on terrorism, on countering foreign interference and on improving community safety. It was just a few months ago that we saw the enormous success of the AFP's Operation Ironside, which took out a significant cross-section of the Australian criminal underworld, and that success was predicated on enabling legislation that we introduced in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government has a very strong track record on national security. Earlier this year, we passed crucial legislation to improve security at our airports and seaports to prevent criminal infiltration of these vital entry points to our country. We have also put in place laws that will allow us to enter agreements to access data held offshore. This will fast-track the time taken by police and intelligence agencies to obtain essential overseas-held dataâ€”and it doesn't stop there. We have a range of bills before the parliament, including for giving police and intelligence agencies more powers to tackle the insidious criminal activity taking place on the dark web, for new extended supervision orders for terrorist offenders, and for the ability to protect our critical infrastructure from both physical threats and cyberthreats. I welcome the support of those opposite for these important national security bills, as they come before the parliament, because now more than ever before we all need to make sure that we are working together in the national interest.
