        [by video link] While the member for Solomon is, basically, freestyling in the Antarctic Territory there's a very important 10th Aboriginal Economic Development Forum happening in his own territory. These are key stakeholders from business, government and the non-profit sector committed to progressing Aboriginal economic develop in

        , starting today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sharing knowledge is critical. We need to look back over the last two decades and ask ourselves what both sides of government have achieved in Aboriginal self-determination, predominantly from economic independence. I think they're very important questions that we raise in Alice Springs, starting today: What is this work, as we define it? How far away should it be from country, where there is unquestionable connection? We need to know that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australia
        </a>
        ns are getting their share of economic activity in their regions, particularly that those opportunities are spread across all households, fairly and evenly, rather than just being enjoyed by one or two. We need to make sure that economic opportunity is to all age groups, not just working-age healthy adults. We shouldn't lose, for instance, those over the age of 40 or 50 as being too late to engage in the global economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This connection to country is extremely important. We understand the need for that connection, but it doesn't mean being trapped on country. We need to be asking questions about at what point business can exist in remote communities, particularly service provision that traditionally, between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , hasn't been monetised necessarily. We know that in the mainstream around half of all employment is service provision. In the notion of global engagement, Indigenous Australia will have an increasing role, walking down both pathsâ€”the traditional Indigenous path but also the global economic one. These are vitally important, and goods and services will be showcased in Alice Springs over the next couple of days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The big question is: where can this all lead? What will Indigenous communities look like in 10 or 20 years from now? Can we initiate a genuine socioeconomic conversation that preserves the best of Indigenous Australia but gives them a chance to do these things: have four out of five children not vulnerable, completing and enjoying school; and four out of five adults, at working age and healthy, engaged in the real economy outside of government jobs. These important questions are ones well worth hearing the answers to in Alice Springs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Ken Wyatt and, particularly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        government have done some exceptional work, both in Nhulunbuy, in East Arnhem Land, and down in the Barkly to trial some new models. We have to admit that much of what we've done hasn't worked. Now is the time for new ideas and to engage Indigenous Australia in making them reality.
