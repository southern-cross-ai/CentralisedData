        parkrun is an international phenomenon. At present there are 210 parkrun locations within Australia. These events are free, organised by local volunteers and inclusive in that they are accessible for young or old, fit or unfit, male or female, regardless of ability or disability. According to the parkrun international site there are 1,074 events worldwide in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy,

        The central idea behind parkrun is very simple: it is a weekly, timed five-kilometre run or walk over the same course each week at the same time, without obligation or cost. Such is the popularity of parkrun that many cities have multiple parkruns. At present Tasmania has parkrun events in Launceston, Hobart and Devonport, with Georgetown to commence shortly, as well as events elsewhere in the state, notably Windsor, in my electorate. I ran my first parkrun at Launceston on 23 February 2013. I have now run 139 parkruns, including 133 at Launceston, three at

        There are many obvious physical, as well as mental, health benefits from undertaking parkrun. Not only is there a very clear correlation between physical exercise and mental health, but the social aspect of parkrun is significant. As a regular at my home parkrun and also a visitor to other parkruns, it is interesting to note that the atmosphere of a parkrun event is welcoming and inviting. Each event will welcome visitors and first-timers and, in particular, people who arrive early, so as to talk amongst themselves, or who will cheer later finishers across the line and attend coffee after the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is very important to note that parkrun is not a competitive event in the sense of a race. parkrun can be an individual challenge in that an individual might be motivated to better their time so as to produce a personal best. However, every regular parkrun attendee knows that the event is non-judgemental in that no-one is expected to perform at a high level, or indeed to run. As a consequence you will often see people who will walk rather than run just to support someone who might be injured, or who is a new participant or a child. The inclusive nature of the event is also emphasised by the fact that elite runners will sometimes walk the course or be seen walking with family or a dog or with a pram just in order to enjoy the social aspect of the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the event is put on by volunteers, all participants are encouraged to volunteer three times each year, and participants are encouraged to thank volunteers as they run or walk around the course. Volunteers also offer encouragement to participants. Launceston parkrun started four years ago with 92 participants, and this calendar year there have been four Launceston events with more than 300 attendees each Saturday morning.

         I am sure the honourable member would be referred to as an elite runner in that space.
