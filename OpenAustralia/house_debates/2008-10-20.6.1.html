        </a>
        through parliament will mean that for the first time there will be a uniform federal system applying to opposite-sex and same-sex de facto couples when their relationships break down. The bill will end the current arrangements, which place a huge administrative and financial burden on separating de facto couples. The bill was long overdue. The Rudd government has acted swiftly to provide a simpler, less costly and fairer regime for de facto couples and their children across Australia.
