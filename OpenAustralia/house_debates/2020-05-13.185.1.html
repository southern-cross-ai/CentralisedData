       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful people in the Goldstein electorate, who, like all other Australians, have endured the difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic. I particularly acknowledge the resilience of many families and workers who have done the right thing by themselves and their community to keep us safe during a difficult time. I know a number of other members have expressed their heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the nurses and the doctors in their community. We have many of those. Many are based at the Sandringham Hospital, our local community hospital, and at the local private hospitals as well as at the nearby hospitals that are doing COVID-19 testing, including Monash and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alfred" rel="nofollow">
         The Alfred
        </a>
        . Each day, those people go to work not knowing the circumstances they're going to face. Our nurses and doctors care for and support people and make sure there is proper testing so that we can constrain the outbreak of this virus. Of course, they are not the only caring health workers who are providing an important service to our community at this time. We have many people in aged care who are doing exactly the same thing for people who are vulnerable and need assistance and support. We say thanks to them as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the many people who are working in small business and to the employers who are supporting workers at this difficult time: we know how difficult it is. Yes, the federal government has provided the JobKeeper program to assist those people and businesses that need assistance, but let's not kid ourselves and think that it has solved all problems. It hasn't. We have people who face challenges around rents, keeping payrolls going and managing their finances and their debt, particularly when they're can't open. And there are the people working in the supermarket sector and all of the retail businesses, who make sure we have a fresh food supply. One of the most important things throughout this crisis is that we remain healthy and happy and maintain our mental health. Maintaining a good diet is an important part of that process.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the teachers—as you know, Deputy Speaker, my husband is a teacher, so he's been Zoom-teaching from our kitchen table, as have many other teachers—all the work that you're doing in supporting children's ongoing education so they can go on and not have a disrupted life from this pandemic is critical. Yes, many people have had to learn to do different things and they've had to learn to be flexible in a circumstance that they weren't necessarily trained for. We're greatly appreciative of their efforts in doing the right thing by the next generation so that they can go on and prosper and succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a lot of community based organisations that have also shown their mettle and how important they are to the social fabric of our community. To the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Eira" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Eira
        </a>
        and Bayside support services, we thank you so much for everything that you have done. Of course, there are many days when I walk down the shopping strips of our community and the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes obvious. Walk down Centre Road in Bentley, Hampton Street in Hampton, Martin, Bay and Church Streets in Brighton and of course the Sandy Village and Beaumaris Concourse, amongst many others, and you'll see how difficult and challenging life can be when people are faced with isolation and difficulty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people are also facing the challenge of isolation in their own homes. I know people are getting frustrated, and part of the challenge is finding the balance in making sure we get the measures right and making sure that you understand the rationale for the measures that our states and the Commonwealth are taking to ensure we put healthcare needs first. That is not going to be an easy task now and it's not going to be an easy task going forward. It requires patience and resilience. So if you need support and assistance, don't be afraid to reach out. Make sure you build a sense of social connectedness with others. Use it as an opportunity to exercise, to maintain your physical and mental health, and make sure you connect with your loved ones, because they're an important part of surviving this pandemic too.
