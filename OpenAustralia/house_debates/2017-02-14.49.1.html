        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday in question time, the Deputy Prime Minister ridiculed anyone who received preferences from the Greens political party. Given that the WA Nationals have now retaliated against the WA Liberals by cutting a deal to preference the Greens political party ahead of the Liberals, does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by the answer he gave in this place yesterday? Is he now determined to just ridicule himself for the sake of consistency, and every other member of the WA National Party?

          I welcome the question from the member for Watson. I always thought the member for Watson might give me a question about water. He is actually the shadow water minister, and the whole time there he has never asked me one question about water—not one! You would think he might about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—you would think that he might ask me a question. Not a chance! All we get is a stand-up, pogo-stick comedian coming to the dispatch box to talk nonsense.

         <p>
          But what I do know about polling, and I do know a little bit about polling, is that I know about Mr 22 per cent over there—22 per cent: that is what they give him! They give the Leader of the Opposition 22 per cent. And I know the member for Grayndler: you are one of our biggest supporters, aren't you? You are watching us. We are doing a good job for you, aren't we? You are getting ready. You are getting ready—you are lining them up.

          The member for Sydney does not like me saying this. Do not worry—you will be next! If the Leader of the Opposition fails, you will be next. You are gone—you will sit back there. The member for Grayndler will come to sit up here and the member for Sydney will go over there. It is all going to happen!
         </p>
         <p>
          There are a couple of others back there—you there might come forward. The member for Whitlam never really was here, so he will go back! It really does not matter, you can see what is happening: you are done and dusted, old mate—the Leader of the Opposition. You are done and dusted. You are all over, ever since you decided that all elections were created different and that there were certain elections that are better than other elections—

                I have to say, Mr Speaker, he is a very funny man, the member for Watson. We know what is wrong with the member for Watson: he wants to be in the story. We have not even given him a chance. But even we know that you, Leader of the Opposition, have not got a chance. You have got no chance at all.
               </p>
               <p>
                If they really want to talk about who is preferencing who, I would say that the member for Sydney is preferencing the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler is definitely voting against the member for Maribyrnong. I would say that your chances of hanging round here for another six months are around about zero.
