        I am very pleased to rise to speak about The Novus Foundation, which this weekend is hosting the Novus gala dinner to support many worthwhile causes in the electorate of Bradfield and causes supported by institutions based in the electorate of Bradfield. The Novus Foundation was formed in 2006. It is a collaboration between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Wahroonga, the McCarroll's automotive group and the San Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wahroonga Rotary has over 60 members and meets every Wednesday morning at 7.15 am for breakfast at the Warrawee Bowling Club. They support many worthwhile local organisations, with a particular focus on projects that serve young people such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYDS" rel="nofollow">
         KYDS
        </a>
        , which is the Ku-Ring-Gai Youth Development Service, StreetWork, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Citizens_Youth_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Police Citizens Youth Club
        </a>
        at Hornsby and several youth leadership training events. McCarroll's automotive is a well-known and longstanding dealer group with a number of dealerships and outlets throughout the electorate of Bradfield. It is well known on Sydney's North Shore and particularly well known for its longstanding support of many worthwhile local charities and causes. The San Foundation is a foundation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Adventist_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Adventist Hospital
        </a>
        at Wahroonga, proudly known as the San, a much-loved institution in the electorate of Bradfield and throughout northern suburbs of Sydney. It is an extremely large and successful hospital run by the Adventist church. It is a hospital which has an emergency room. It is a teaching hospital of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Sydney
        </a>
        and has advanced capabilities in many fields of medicine.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Novus Foundation came together with the intent of developing and supporting projects that are directed particularly at the welfare of young people in the district of Hornsby and Ku-Ring-Gai. Since it was established, the Novus Foundation has raised over $1.25 million for a variety of different organisations that are investing in and supporting young people. Their major event each year is the Novus dinner, and that will occur this Saturday, 7 May, with more than 500 locals expected to attend this very important charity event. This year, the funds raised at the Novus dinner will go to help the Sydney Adventist Hospital's Open Heart International volunteer cardiac surgery team and two local youth services: KYDS and StreetWork.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud to support the Novus gala dinner. I am looking forward to a good night with many other members of our community. I congratulate all involved in this project, which is doing so much to support people in Bradfield and more broadly.
