        I'd like to acknowledge and thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker" rel="nofollow">
         John Walker
        </a>
        , from Sapphire Beach, who was recently awarded a Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for his services to St. Augustine's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Parish" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Parish
        </a>
        and the wider Lismore diocese.
       </p>
       <p>
        John has been involved in the parish for decades. He is always seen to be going above and beyond to positively impact those around him and provide valuable assistance to the parish schools office. John paid a strong role in creating the parish's out-of-school-hours care service at the primary school, a service that is still running and incredibly popular. He's also offered valuable expertise to the parish schools office on numerous occasions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice, translated from Latin, means 'for the church and Pope', and the medal was established in 1888 by

         Pope Leo XIII
        </a>
        . It is the highest commendation from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Father" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Father
        </a>
        to members. In a ceremony at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        parish, Bishop Greg Homeming presented John with the award. This is a strong testament to John's continued dedication and invaluable services to the church and the community. I'd like to thank and congratulate John on receiving the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for his efforts towards the church. I know John's wife, Jenny, his daughters, Gina and Diana, and family are very proud of him.
