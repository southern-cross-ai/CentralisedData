        I'd like to congratulate the millions of Australian that have secured a COVID-19 vaccine and have shown responsibility for themselves, for the community and for the welfare of others. At this point, 4.362 million Australians have got a COVID-19 vaccine, but that means that there are many Australians that have not. All I can say is that, when we come into this chamber, our focus should be on one thing and one thing only: to encourage Australians to take that responsibility to protect themselves and others, and not to indulge in cheap politics. Of course, in my great state of Victoria at the moment, many Victorians are struggling with a lockdown. I would like to thank and congratulate the 494,037 Victorians that have got their vaccine doses, with nearly 20,000 having been administered in the past 24 hours. Finally, I would like to give a big shout-out to those people who are supporting others in this difficult time: the carers, the teachers, the nurses, the parent who are assisting children in their homeschooling. They deserve the best when they look to this parliament and to know that we are backing them, and that is exactly what the Morrison government is doing.
