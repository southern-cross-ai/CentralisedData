         Greek Australians
        </a>
        a happy Greek Independence Day. Greece and Australia enjoy a close and constructive relationship based on strong community ties. I have the honour of representing one of the most multiculturally diverse seats in Australia, and the Greek community within my electorate is one of the most active and engaged groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like many migrant communities who have travelled to this country, Greek Australians have played an important part in its success. Greece has been going through severe economic hardship in recent years, and it has been amazing to see this community maintaining such strong links with Greece and the resilience of the Greek people throughout this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although large numbers of Greeks migrated to Australia during the 1950s and 1960s, Greek Australians have been here since the earliest days of European settlement. In fact, in a true Australian story, the first recorded arrival of Greeks to Australia was in 1829 as convicts sentenced to transportation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . This migrant population has grown over the following generations, and in 2011 nearly 100,000 Greek-born individuals were recorded as living in Australia and 378,300 Australians claimed Greek ancestry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greek Australians in our community epitomise the incredible work ethic and the greatest community values that have helped to build our nation. I note that hundreds of people marched in Sydney on Sunday in celebration of Greek Independence Day, proudly displaying the Greek and Australian flags side by side. I salute the Greek community of Reid and thank them for their invaluable contribution. Happy Greek Independence Day.
