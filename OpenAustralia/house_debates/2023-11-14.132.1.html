        I want to take the opportunity this evening to update the House on what has been happening in my electorate of Chisholm and surrounds over the last few weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the great joy of attending Oakleigh Glendi, which was a two-day celebration of cultural diversity, Greek heritage, Hellenic culture and community spirit. We have a beautiful and vibrant Greek community in my electorate, and it was wonderful to welcome the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        , Andrew Giles, to the eventâ€”it was his first Glendi. And it's such great fortune to have the minister in the House this evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oakleigh Glendi was attended by thousands of people. It was a wonderful time of coming together to share delicious food, to enjoy fantastic performances and of course to celebrate Greek and Hellenic culture. I want to offer my congratulations to the Greek Orthodox Community of Oakleigh and District, and Oakleigh Grammar for organising a really wonderful Glendi.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last few weeks I've also hosted the first Chisholm Women's Health Forum. Growing evidence has shown that systemic issues in healthcare delivery and medical research mean that women often suffer poorer health outcomes. We know that women disproportionately experience delayed diagnosis, overprescribing and failure to thoroughly investigate symptoms. I was really proud to talk to my community about the work that our government has been undertaking, including establishing the National Women's Health Advisory Council. This has brought together diverse expertise to examine the unique challenges that women and girls experience in the health system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chisholm Women's Health Forum allowed the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, who attended virtually, along with Professor Helena Teede, director of the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to listen to women, hear their stories and answer their questions. An invitation was extended to every woman in my electorate of Chisholm to join the forum and to share their stories of their experiences within the healthcare system.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really want to thank everyone who came to the forum and everyone who reached out to me with their stories of the health system. Women shared stories of missed diagnoses, delayed diagnoses and of not being listened to or believed. There were some positive stories too, of medical professionals taking the time to listen to and to communicate clearly with patients about their health. I'm really pleased that our government is prioritising women's health. Once again, I would like to thank all of the women who attended and the women who shared their stories. I'm grateful, and value their participation and contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the pleasure earlier this month to open the Wild at Art Showcase at the Box Hill Community Arts Centre, in my electorate. I was really pleased to attend this event and to show my support. This year, over 6,800 children picked up their paintbrushes and pens across Australia to help raise awareness of Australia's threatened plants and animals as part of the Wild at Art threatened species competition. This was facilitated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Conservation Foundation
        </a>
        . Of the chosen pieces of artwork, 157 pieces were completed by children local to Chisholm. There were some stunning, heartfelt and very thought-provoking artworks exhibited by Australia's next generation of artists. I want to say well done and congratulations to all involved. I'm pleased to advise the House that as part of the 'Save our big backyard' campaign, which the children were advocating for, I will be championing the cause of the southern brown bandicoot, an endangered animal which used to be common in our part of the world in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Unfortunately, it isn't anymore. I look forward to supporting this worthy cause at home in my electorate of Chisholm, and in this place through my role here.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've said previously in this place, many times, that it's a great privilege to be the member for Chisholm. It has always been important to me that I take the time to listen and engage in the lives of the people in my community in a meaningful way, and I'm really grateful for every moment in my electorate that I'm able to do that. I want to thank my community for the many invitations to attend events and I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to attend my many mobile offices in the electorate, and those who have contacted my office. The engagement and support of my community allows me to be a better representative.
