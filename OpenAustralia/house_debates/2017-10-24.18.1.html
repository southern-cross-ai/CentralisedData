       <p>
        It's a great state, Queensland, but having a government that has mastered the art of being a small target and doing nothing is incredibly frustrating. Queensland pays 30 per cent more for power than any other state in this nation, and because they're government-owned power generators all the money goes in the pocket of the Premier. Then she has the temerity to hand back 50 bucks a year! It's as if you've been running a corner store and ripping off the kids for years, and then you give half the money back to the parents but keep ripping them off. This is a $1.5 billion overcharging of Queensland families.

        Now, I mentioned 'doing nothing' because there's nothing happening on our roads, either. We saw them cancelling projects when they came into government and then delaying announcements of important intersections in the city like Cleveland Redland Bay Road and Giles Road. They have the temerity to introduce it now, when the developer was begging for years to build this road, and the community begged for years to stop the disastrous crashes that we've seen at that intersection. Well, it's finally being built before the election, and it's not a moment too soon.

        This is a government who contrives to announce things just before an election. This fundamentally exposes them as a do-nothing government focused on renaming the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        with $9 million worth of useless signs, money that could have been invested in roads, and using another $11 million to consult with unions about the decision. This is a go-nowhere, do-nothing Labor government. We're begging for upgrades of our intersections, and with a change of government we will achieve that.
