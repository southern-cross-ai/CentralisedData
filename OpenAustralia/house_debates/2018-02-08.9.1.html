       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 4) 2017-2018, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018, which was introduced a moment ago, are the additional estimates appropriation bills for this financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just under $133 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, this bill would provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        with just over $27 million. This includes approximately $24 million for payments to the states and territories to implement national reforms in the non-government school sector and to help schools transition to the new schools-funding arrangements. This forms part of the additional funding for the Quality Schools reform package.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        would receive just under $16 million in 2017-18 including capital funding of around $11 million to implement three projects being brought forward to tranche 2 of the Welfare Payment Infrastructure Transformation program. This program will progressively replace Centrelink's ageing technology platform.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_National_Assessments" rel="nofollow">
         Office of National Assessments
        </a>
        would receive approximately $12 million in capital funding as part of the establishment of the Office of National Intelligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also proposes the repeal of 15 old annual appropriation acts from 2012-13 and 2013-14. This is simply a housekeeping measure, as the appropriations in these acts either have been exhausted or are no longer required.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 3 of the bill provides a list of the annual appropriation acts proposed for repeal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules 1 and 2 to the bill and the portfolio additional estimate statements tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
