       </p>
       <p>
        The Aboriginal People of Australia are the original inhabitants and the first Nation people of this great southern land Australia. Our continuing cultures and traditions are l,000s of years old and are recognised as the oldest on Earth. Although Aboriginal People come together as one nation through many different self-governing language and kinship groups with unique cultures and traditions, the sanctity of marriage between man and woman continues to be held in honour among all.

         Our Fathers
        </a>
        and Mothers are also honoured and form the foundation of our families, clans and systems, and pass down our teachings, our culture, our traditions, from generation to generation. It is therefore an affront to the Aboriginal People of Australia to suggest another definition of marriage.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_people" rel="nofollow">
         Aboriginal people
        </a>
        of Australia recognise the House of Representatives as a governing body and strongly calls upon the House to reject any attempt to redefine the institution of marriage, and in doing so, honour the sanctity of both the tradition of marriage and the spiritual implication of this sacred union.

       <p>
        from 40 citizens

        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        On indulgence: I was approached by the leaders of 70 different cultural groups to present the Uluru Bark Petition on their behalf and to make a very short statement on the purpose of the petition. It is a petition to be presented to you, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to make that statement.

        Leave granted.

        The heart of the Petition states that marriage between a man and woman is, and has always been, sacred to the oldest living culture on earth. The Petition adds that fathers and mothers—who are deeply honoured in Aboriginal culture—also form the "foundation of our families, clans and systems, and pass down our teachings, our culture, our traditions, from generation to generation."
