       </p>
       <p>
        The work will involve the construction of a new seawater reserve and osmosis plant and a capacity upgrade of the existing wastewater treatment plant. The proposed works will generate multiple benefits by protecting water security through a sustainable water source, ensuring safer, more livable communities and the continuity of economic activity. The estimated cost of the works is $18.4 million, excluding

        is proposing to undertake environmental remediation of the Douglas Shoal area within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The remediation works will address extensive damage caused by the coal carrier
        <i>

        </i>
        which ran aground in 2010, causing contamination of an area of more than 40 hectares. The proposed environmental remediation will involve the removal of rubble and contaminants that are impeding natural recovery and management and disposal of these onshore.

       <p>
        The estimated cost of remediation works is $19.4 million, excluding GST. The works will be funded from an out-of-court settlement negotiated by the Commonwealth with the ship's owners and insurers. The works must be referred to, considered by, and reported on by, both houses of parliament by the Public Works Committee before works can commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, works are expected to commence from mid-2022 and be completed by early 2024.
