        My question is to the Prime Minister. Tracy, who works in an Aboriginal cooperative, told the royal commission that she was conned into paying more than $10,000 in funeral insurance premiums for a policy that was only worth $8,000, and the dodgy company that sold Tracy this insurance used misleading marketing to trick her into believing that it was backed by the Aboriginal community. Why won't the Prime Minister schedule extra sitting weeks before the election so this parliament can stop dodgy insurers ripping off Australians?

         It's a very serious issue and it requires a very serious response. That's what the government is doing in responding and taking action on all 76 recommendations of the royal commission, and we will do so in a way that follows the proper process of getting legislation right. Now, the Labor Party have had 15 days to respond to the royal commission, and what they announced today sounds like they spent 15 minutes putting it together. The problem with the Labor Party is they never learn from their mistakes. The home insulation royal commission found and warned of 'rushed, ill-thought-through policies with catastrophic consequences'. The Labor Party have been down this path before. They get all rushed up with blood on politics and they come in here and thump their chests. But we know that, when the Labor Party rushes legislation, the consequences are catastrophic. We saw that in home insulation. We saw it last week when they rushed their bill in here and supported weaker border protection laws. The Labor Party cannot be trusted with these very sensitive matters. They demonstrated that last time when they were in government and they would do so again if they were given the chance.
