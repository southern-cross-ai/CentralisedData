        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain why we legislate one set of laws for setting superannuation entitlements, pay, termination payouts and benefits for our constituents, including two million on the age pension, and another set of far more generous laws and arrangements for setting the pay, superannuation, termination payouts and other privileges for members of parliament?

        <p>
         The question asked by the member for Calare clearly relates to the announcement I made today in relation to some proposed changes to the law concerning the superannuation entitlements of members of parliament first elected in the 2004 election and some, in some circumstances, elected in 2001. I should say that it is a proposal that has the express support of the opposition. What is happening is that members of parliament in that category are to be treated in the same way as Commonwealth public servants and indeed in the same way as members of their staff.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that it is easy to criticise any alteration which in any way enhances the remuneration of members of parliament. I do not believe that the great bulk of members of parliament in this place are overpaid. I think most people who come into this place come in with a sincere commitment to serve the people of Australia according to their philosophy. I believe that if we continue to take the populist route on this issue we will trash the gene pool of potential entrants to this parliament. I do not want to see the parliament of this nation filled with trade union officials, political staffers or careerist political figures who have had no acquaintance at allâ€”

          I want it filled with a cross-section of this nation, and I am very proud of the fact that in the last election, in 2004, an astonishing range of the abilities and talents of the Australian people entered the national parliament on my side. I defend this decision and I will be interested to hear that the Leader of the Opposition also endorses what he has indicated to me privately.
