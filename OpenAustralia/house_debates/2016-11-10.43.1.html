         I thank the honourable member for his question. This morning I was able to speak with President-elect Trump and, as I noted earlier, offered him congratulations. In our discussion we canvassed the importance of a strong American presence in the Asia-Pacific, and I underlined the importance of maintaining that strong American commitment to our region, because it has been the very foundation of the stability, the peace, the prosperity, that has flowed from that over the last 40 years. The President-elect described to me his commitment—

           to increasing investment in America's defence capabilities and, in particular, his commitment to expanding the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" rel="nofollow">
            United States Navy
           </a>
           , of such enormous significance in our region. I described to the President our government's commitment to our naval shipbuilding program, where—notwithstanding the neglect, over six years, of the honourable members opposite—we have committed to commissioning 54 new naval vessels as part of the largest naval shipbuilding program in our history. We discussed the importance of us continuing to work closely together in our region, and we recognised the importance of our enduring alliance and our enduring defence relationship. We discussed the challenges that we face globally, against Daesh. The President-elect described his commitment to eliminating ISIL, eliminating that terrorist scourge, and of course we discussed the way in which we are working together in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           and indeed around the world. We discussed the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
            TPP
           </a>
           , the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I observed to the President-elect that Australia regarded the TPP as a very important strategic commitment by the United States to the region, and we continue to encourage the Congress to ratify it. It was a very warm discussion, a very frank discussion. The President-elect, of course, is a businessman. He has been a deal-maker all his life. He will approach the challenges of his office with pragmatism and with the practicality that comes from a life in business. We will continue to work together in the cause of peace and stability. Our enduring national interests will compel that. The alliance between Australia and the United States will always be strong and will, I am sure, become stronger yet in the years ahead.
