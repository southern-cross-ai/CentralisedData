       <p>
        The past fortnight has been significant for people in my electorate because the coalition has taken another important step towards delivering a positive growth plan for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . The first commitment made in our growth plan, a very important commitment, was to deliver a purpose-built Commonwealth agency with 600 local jobs in Gosford which, in turn, will help to create even more jobs, hundred more jobs right across the coast. The Central Coast is right behind us in their determination to help us deliver this important commitment. Our local chambers of commerce, our community groups, our local residents and our local businesses are all right behind us. I thought we had everyone on board backing the Central Coast and the creation of more new jobs into a Gosfordâ€”until now. The Central Coast community and local businesses have now learnt that, while they have the support of the coalition government, they do not have the support of Labor. Just this week, the Labor opposition once again failed the Central Coast when they used this vital investment in Gosford in a bizarre swipe against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        and the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would appear that Labor want fewer jobs in Gosford, not more. In contrast, at the last election we committed to deliver 300 jobs and a Commonwealth agency into Gosford and in the budget the Treasurer announced we would double that to 600. this is game changer for the Central Coast. It reflects the hopes and aspirations of people in my electorate who want more local jobs and more opportunities so they can work in the region in which they live. Expressions of interest were called to build the agency on 16 October and I have already heard from many locals who want to get involved in this significant project for Gosford. It is important because 40,000 commuters do not have enough of these opportunities at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        For six years, Labor failed to invest in Gosford in such a significant way. In contrast, under a coalition government we are already seeing more job opportunities for people in just one short year.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, just this week, the shadow Assistant Treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Leigh" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Leigh
        </a>
        , hopelessly failed to back these 600 important jobs for Gosford. When he was asked on ABC Central Coast radio just yesterday if Labor would wind back the tax office on the Central Coast if elected, the member for Fraser was unable to give a guarantee or a definite commitment, instead saying, 'We would formulate election policies in 2016.' What does this say about Labor's commitment to the Central Coast? The member for Fraser, it would seem, is against more employment opportunities on the Central Coast, and the former member for Robertson, now a Labor senator in the other place, is strangely silent.
       </p>
       <p>
        After six years of Labor inaction, with no initiatives to boost employment on the Central Coast, do the people of Robertson really have to wait until 2016 to hear Labor's plans? Only the coalition has a positive plan for the Central Coast that means more jobs, more opportunity and a better future for our region.
