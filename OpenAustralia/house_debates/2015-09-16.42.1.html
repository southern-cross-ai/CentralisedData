        I want to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Chandler" rel="nofollow">
         William Chandler
        </a>
        from

         Centenary State High School
        </a>
        who is undertaking work experience here in Canberra. William has spent the past two days at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        and has worked with the tour guides, showing groups of students around the memorial, as well as working within the exhibits section and sorting through a variety of historical photographs and artefacts. William will continue work experience on Thursday and Friday with the military heraldry section and the education section whilst doing work experience in my office here today.
       </p>
       <p>
        When William initially inquired with the Australian War Memorial, they did not have a work experience program. As William has a strong passion for military history, he contacted me to get some advice on how to approach the department. He produced a flyer suggesting a student work experience program, which he thought would be extremely beneficial to students across the country and to the War Memorial itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within days, the memorial contacted William accepting his proposal. Throughout the week, William has gained an incredible insight into the wonderful work involved at the Australian War Memorial. The memorial has provided a wonderful opportunity for William, who has an incredible passion for our history—Australian and military—at the very young age of just 16 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the Australian War Memorial for taking William on this week and giving him this great opportunity. I also want to recognise William's initiative, and I hope that his hard work has opened the door for other students around the country in the future. William is a delightful young man and I wish him all the best in the future.
