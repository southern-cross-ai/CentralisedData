        I am pleased to inform the House that three constituents of my electorate of Moore have been recognised for their contribution to our community as part of this year's Australia Day Honours List within the general division of the Order of Australia. Kallaroo resident Lynne Bradshaw was appointed a

         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in recognition of her significant service to animal welfare at the state and national levels. A successful Perth business woman in medical technology, her compassionate advocacy for higher standards of live export and farm management standards stemmed from her love of our uniquely Australian fauna, when she first made Australia home from England more than 40 years ago. It was the goannas in her Sydney backyard that sparked her love for animals. Mrs Bradshaw first joined the

        </a>
        as a board member in 1997 and has been the president of the RSPCA's WA branch since 2004. She became the first female national president of the organisation in 2006, a role she held until 2013. Mrs Bradshaw also served on the Animal Ethics Committee for the Telethon Kids Institute from 2006 to 2017. She is also currently a representative of the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of the Department of Agriculture and Food in

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in recognition of her long commitment to social welfare. Starting in 1966, Mrs Browner joined the Scarborough Police and Citizens Youth Club as a committee member, a role she would continue until 1998. During her time as a member, it wasn't long before she would take on greater responsibility as a board member of the Federation of Police and Citizens Youth Clubs of Western Australia from 1979 to 1986. Mrs Browner was the founding president of the WA Police Widows Guild from 1972 to 1978 and remains actively committed to the services it provides in offering assistance to the wives and families of police officers killed in duty. In 1976, Mrs Browner, as a founding member, helped form the WA Police Families Advisory Council and today is a life member and continues to invest her time to be an active committee member of the council.
