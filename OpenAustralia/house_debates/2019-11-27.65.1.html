        My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday and just now the Prime Minister told the House that he had 'spoken with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        police commissioner, Mick Fuller, about the instigation, the nature and the substance of their inquiries.' How on earth was it appropriate for you as Prime Minister to speak to the New South Wales police commissioner about the substance of an investigation on the very day it was launched?

                 I said this on four occasions in the House yesterday in response to questions. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he is going to ask questions, he should listen to the answers and not sulk, as the Labor Party have been in a constant sulk for the last six months. What I did yesterday is what I told the House I would do, and then I went and did it. Out of absolute courtesy, as I should to this House, I came back into this House and fully put forward those issues and the assessment that I had taken. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the comments by the commissioner today. Mick Fuller has said today, in a doorstep interview:
