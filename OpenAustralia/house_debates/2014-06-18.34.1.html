        I want to pay tribute to an Australian team who defeated the Netherlands in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_World_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Hockey World Cup
        </a>
        . That is right, the Kookaburras took down the Netherlands. They demolished the Netherlands 6:1 in the Hockey World Cup last Sunday. It was an amazing effort and something I am sad that we have not played up enough; it has just not been a media event. But I want to congratulate the ABC, who did actually broadcast these matches for my hockey-mad family. This was a godsend. It was an amazing effort by the Kookaburras: a 6-1 win, with Victorian Chris Ciriello getting a hat-trick off those amazing penalty corners and a great win for

        , who has announced he will be retiring as coach after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —and a great effort by

        in the last minutes, with Jamie now holding the record equally with Jay Stacey for appearing for the Kookaburras 321 times; an amazing effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the Hockeyroos did not do as well, they also made an amazing effort appearing in the finals, going down 2-1, also against the Netherlands, on their home turf—if you have ever watched the Netherlands cheer on a hockey team, you would be surprised at how passionate they are about this game, as are many people in Australia.
       </p>

        I would like to end this statement with great concern about the fear of losing the three water based pitches we have in Victoria now: one at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">

        , in my seat, which is going to make way for housing, and the two at the State Netball Hockey Centre, which may go because of the East West Link. This would be a shame.
