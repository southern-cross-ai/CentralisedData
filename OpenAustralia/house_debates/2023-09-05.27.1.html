       <p>
        I rise today to highlight the significance of the 30th anniversary of the Men's Shed Association, which plays a vital role in facilitating connection, community and camaraderie in the electorate of Fadden. Since the original community shed for men was established in 1993, the movement has been integral in supporting positive health and mental health outcomes for a segment of our community who give so much without asking much in return. In the Men's Shed movement, individuals can learn new skills, work on projects, make like-minded mates and, in doing so, support one another. I am extremely proud of the efforts of Merv Holliday,

        and the team at Labrador Men's Shed, who are celebrating the anniversary with lunch tomorrow. Their community work includes a mentoring program with Labrador State School students, which has been running since 2010. Whilst I can't be in attendance tomorrow, I look forward to catching up with you all soon. Likewise, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the amazing work done by

        and the team at Oxenford Men's Shed, supporting more than 130 members, often funded by their sausage sizzles at Bunnings. Lastly, congratulations to Jeff Cheales and the team at Pimpama Men's Shed. I was there as a councillor when that facility opened, and I am proud that it serves the Fadden community all these years later. Congratulations to the Men's Sheds serving within the electorate of Fadden, and all the best for the next 30 years.
