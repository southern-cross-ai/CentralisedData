        was once asked why he held so many press conferences. Why, despite his waning health at the height of World War

        , did he feel the need to feed the chooks as regularly as he did, when all the journalists did was ask him unwelcome questions? Curtin replied, because the press is the voice of democracy.

        Peter is an award-winning Australian journalist who right now is sitting in a three-metre by four-metre cell in Cairo, Egypt. He spends 23 hours a day in the cell. He has been there for three months, charged with allegedly spreading false news. Peter and his two

        colleagues have not been presented with a single piece of evidence to justify the charges. Being an international journalist is often a dangerous job.

Being a journalist is not a crime. I take this opportunity to urge the Prime Minister and the government to do everything they can to help secure Peter's immediate release.
