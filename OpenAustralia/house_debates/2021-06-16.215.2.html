       <p>
        Today I wanted to talk specifically about people and organisations that make a massive difference to my community, my constituency and my region by their good efforts and good deeds. Being a Victorian—and a number of other Victorians are here with me at the moment—it's been a tough year and a bit for us all, particularly for those that are in Victoria at the moment. From small and large businesses to sole traders, everybody in every constituency that we represent has done it tough and has done an amazing job in seeing off the worst of the COVID pandemic. Obviously, with the state government announcing the relaxation of the recent lockdown restrictions, some hope has been provided, but what I want to talk about separate to that—and we do it on an ongoing basis—is the people that continue to provide hope on an ongoing basis to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a way I would characterise what we're doing at the moment in my project that I'm about to talk about as a light at the end of the tunnel. I want to talk about a project that was started before the lockdown. It's a project which showcases positive stories of amazing people and organisations that make a real difference in my constituency and electorate of Holt. Each week over the coming months I'll be releasing videos celebrating and highlighting the unsung heroes and organisations in Holt. The initiative under which I'll be doing this is entitled 'This is Holt:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Community" rel="nofollow">
         Our Community
        </a>
        - Our Stories'.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've posted three or four short videos that encapsulate what individuals and organisations do. The initial filming started before the second lockdown. So, if you're watching the videos and seeing people without masks, they were done before the second lockdown. I think what they do—and we hope that you enjoy these stories—is again amplify that, in a world that is seized with anxieties and fears about COVID and about what might be happening internationally, we need to remember what makes Australia great, which is each of these constituent units, these people going about their tasks, working for the good of others, not seeking a claim, not seeking any fame and not seeking support or thanks but just going about their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a lot of organisations and people that feature. I'm very proud of these people. I see them in my privileged position as a member of parliament. I want you all to see them and appreciate them for the great work they do in keeping our community working and thriving.
