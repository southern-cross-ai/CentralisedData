       <p>
        Often in this parliament we draw aside, pay tribute, give recognition and pause to remember people who have contributed to national life, state life and local communities. Tonight I draw aside and pay tribute to the life and achievements of Mrs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Edwards" rel="nofollow">
         Dorothy Edwards
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBE" rel="nofollow">
         CBE
        </a>
        , the first woman mayor of a major Australian city, who died in Launceston in March this year. Dorothy Edna Annie Edwards grew up in Deloraine, near Launceston, where her father was the local council clerk. She was educated at Launceston High School and later at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        . She studied at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics" rel="nofollow">
         London School of Economics
        </a>
        and graduated as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts" rel="nofollow">
         Master of Arts
        </a>
        . Mrs Edwards taught at Launceston High for many years. Many of my constituents remember her as an exacting and very professional teacher, in the best traditions and, if I may say, the old traditions of the Tasmanian state system. Dorothy Edwards joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Council
        </a>
        of Women as secretary of the northern Tasmanian chapter and held many offices in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCW" rel="nofollow">
         NCW
        </a>
        and its international affiliate.
       </p>
       <p>
        A special tribute was paid to her at the civic memorial service in Launceston by Mrs Mollie Campbell Smith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        , another of my distinguished constituents. Having grown up in a family involved with local government, Dorothy Edwards was incensed that the law prevented Tasmanian women from being elected to local councils. She campaigned for the Launceston Corporation Act to be changed to permit women to stand for the city council—and the law was changed in 1945. In 1949, Dorothy Edwards stood for election—the first woman to do so. Seven other candidates stood, and Dorothy Edwards was resoundingly elected second on the poll. She served as a Launceston alderman for 15 years and was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Launceston" rel="nofollow">
         Mayor of Launceston
        </a>
        from 1955 to 1957.
       </p>
       <p>
        That does not seem so long ago, but Dorothy Edwards was the first woman in Australia to head one of its major cities. During her time as mayor and alderman, Dorothy Edwards was significantly involved in the major flood prevention measures built to protect the city from a repeat of the devastation of the very well known 1929 floods. After retiring from the council, she was Commissioner of the ABC from 1962 to 1975, served on the state library board for 25 years, was a member of the Decimal Currency Committee and was Chairman of the Board of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        . She was also involved in many other community affairs. She was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President" rel="nofollow">
         Vice President
        </a>
        of the

        </a>
        of Women from 1963 to 1979 and a Life Vice President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
         National Council of Women
        </a>
        Australia. Mrs Edwards was appointed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
         OBE
        </a>
        in 1958 and promoted to CBE in 1979. She was also admitted as a Freeman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Launceston" rel="nofollow">
         City of Launceston
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The present Mayor of Launceston, Alderman Ivan Dean, and current and former aldermen of the City of Launceston honoured Dorothy Edwards with a civic memorial service at the very beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Hall
        </a>
        , where photographs of her life were shown and excerpts of a interview she recorded not long before her death were played. In recalling her as a former Mayor of the City of Launceston, I think it is important for me to say that Launceston is a very proud city. It is a historic city. It is, in fact, an early city of Australia. It was settled in 1806 and is this year celebrating its bicentennial year. I often say that Launceston is a place of proud history, spirited people and great natural beauty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I extend my sympathies to Mrs Edwards’s son, Alan, and other members of her family. They can be enormously proud of their mother’s contributions to Australian civic and cultural life and for being an important part of Launceston’s culture, its civic life and now its history. I think it is important that the House record the achievements of our great citizens, and Dorothy Edwards certainly qualifies as a great Australian and a great Tasmanian. I know that all of my Tasmanian colleagues in this place and in the other place would want to associate themselves with these remarks.
