       <p>
        Madam Deputy Speaker, how pleasant it is to remain in the chamber with you in the chair. I rise to commend the vision for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        North youth centre, the Youth Point Connect, and to stand here and publicly acknowledge those that carried the vision to fulfilment. I have said a number of times in the House that Fadden is the fastest growing federal electorate in the nation. With an electorate growing so fast there is no greater need than to provide facilities for our young people. The youth are 100 per cent of the future. They are a gift to generations we will not see. It is incumbent on us to ensure that we provide the services and the facilities that our young people need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising this, in 2003, as the northern Gold Coast population began to explode and unfold and many of its senior community leaders became concerned for the safety of the youth in the northern Gold Coast area of Fadden, the first of three public meeting were called on 10 March 2004 to discuss this growing issue. Meetings were called and chaired by the division 3 councillor, Grant Pforr. They were attended by my predecessor, the Hon.

        police station, Senior Sergeant Murray Underwood; and the now councillor for division 4 Margaret Grummitt. Other interested community leaders were also present.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 16 September 2004 a steering committee was formed to establish a youth centre in that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Paradise Point
        </a>
        , Runaway Bay, Labrador area. The body was incorporated and named the Gold Coast North youth centre with its first meeting and the board elected on 1 April 2006. Let me acknowledge the inaugural board for their vision, commitment and hard work: Runaway Bay Lions Club member Bernie Scobie is the foundation chairman, Paradise Point Progress Association’s Fred Woodley is the foundation vice chairman, Runaway Bay police officer Senior Sergeant Murray Underwood is the secretary, SAILS’ Russell McClue is treasurer, and Coomera Watersports Club’s Liz Pforr and Coomera youth centre’s Derek Venske. A number of youth representatives were also there: Youth at Risk Alliance’s Lisa Fancisco;

        </a>
        divisional councillor Grant Pforr; assistant to Grant Pforr, the committee grants and research officer Sharon Solyma; the Gold Coast City Council youth social planner Donna Matulis; and the

        </a>
        student representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grant Pforr provided divisional funding on an ongoing basis, supported by many of our unselfish community organisations who assisted with funds and time. These included the Gold Coast City Council, which provided funding and lease of the land; Stocklands donated, transported and erected two buildings on site, including covering the roof and full verandas; the Runaway Bay Lions Club; Schlenker Surveying Queensland donated $20,000; the Paradise Point Uniting Church; the Zen Property Group—the harmony unit development; the Runaway Bay Junior Leagues Club;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Paradise Point—let me acknowledge the chairperson, Ann Glenister, for her foresight in supporting the group—and Runaway Bay Shopping Village, and I acknowledge the centre management for their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        These major donors joined with the original senior community members to establish a great community youth facility in the northern Gold Coast. Grant Pforr has now pledged further funding from divisional funds, and the Gold Coast City Council has given approval for stage 2 construction to the tune of $500,000. I commend the board for their vision. I thank the chairman, Bernie Scobie, the vice-chairman, Fred Woodley, and all of the board for carrying the vision through to fulfilment. I thank the many donors who came forward to support this very worthy project. In the fastest-growing electorate in the nation, we desperately need more community facilities, and I pledge to work very hard with the area consultative committee and, of course, this government to ensure the fastest-growing electorate gets the infrastructure and services it so desperately needs.
