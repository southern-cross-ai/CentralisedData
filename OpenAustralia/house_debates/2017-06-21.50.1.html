         South West
        </a>
        Football League women's team, who created history by winning the first interleague match against the Peel Football and Netball League in Mandurah as part of the country championships. This is inspiring countless young girls, who can play what is the best game in the world. We saw some amazingly good skills, great skills, from these women footballers, playing really top-quality football. South West full-forward Bethany Bond was best on ground, and she kicked eight goals, seven before half-time. Bethany was ably assisted by captain Trish Lake in front of goals as well, who booted six of her own goals. Larisa Versaci and Kristy Larsen were fantastic in the middle of the ground and they worked hard right throughout the gameâ€”again, there were great skills on display.

        What excellent work by the inaugural coach, Teagan Smith. She has done a great job, a fantastic job, of guiding this side to their first-ever win in this type of competition. And they have only been training together for three weeks.

        women's group is in its first season, with Bunbury, Busselton, Carey Park, Harvey, Harvey Brunswick Leschenault and South Bunbury all fielding fantastic women's sides. Well done to the South West Football League altogether, and well done to the South West Football League women's team! Congratulations to you for inspiring and making history.
