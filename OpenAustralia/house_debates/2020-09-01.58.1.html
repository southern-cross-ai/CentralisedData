        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. He's a great advocate for small businesses, because he's had firsthand experience at running and operating his own business. He understands just how hard it is for our businesses. We are all aware of the ongoing impacts of this pandemic. This government has implemented, and is delivering, a number of very practical solutions that are going to help individuals, families, small businesses and communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me start with the jobs task forces that we announced this morning. These are flying squads that are going to be going into the regions that have been the most hard hit. What those squads are going to do is that they're going to look to tailor support, to develop some local plans and to help people get back into jobs as part of the road to recovery. We know that successful businesses are the keys to creating jobs in our community. Of course, JobKeeper is very central to that plan. It certainly helps businesses to keep their doors open. There are countless stories that we have all heard about how JobKeeper has been a lifeline for so many businesses and, of course, for so many workers. Just one example is a business owner called Lorraine at the Peppermint Green Coffee House in Joondalup, in the member for Moore's electorate. She says that her eight staff are like family to her and that JobKeeper has meant that she's been able to keep them over a very stressful period when she was forced to close. That business is back up and running again and, as Lorraine says, they are contributing back to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's very important to remember that, when we talk about the economic crisis, it's not just about the budget bottom line or figures on a business balance sheet; it's about people's lives. When businesses close there's an enormous toll that's taken. People lose their jobs and they fall behind on their mortgages. Families struggle with paying their household budgets and they endure emotional and financial stress. That's why the support that this government is offering is so important, because this is about supporting people at times that they need it the absolute most. What this government is doing is making sure that we are supporting individuals, families and small businesses in particular. We are making sure that Australia is clearly open for business. We are supporting those small businesses as they support their workers through this COVID-19 pandemic.
