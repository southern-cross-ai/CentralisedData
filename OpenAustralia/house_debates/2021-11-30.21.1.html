       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate an amazing Territory business, Monsoon Aquatics, which has been announced as the 2021 Australian Exporter of the Year. From 89 finalists from around Australia, this Territory company were acknowledged for the growth in their business and the growth in their exports. They sustainably harvest fish and coral for aquariums around the world. In 2011 Monsoon Aquatics became the first company to sustainably export coral, and more recently they have been engaging in a world-first program of coral aquaculture, where they're spawning endemic Australian coral with a view to commercialising this particular practice and product. It's world-leading stuff and it's a very exciting development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Huge congratulations to the director, Dan, and Brooke and the entire team at Monsoon Aquatics. This award is a direct reflection of all their hard work and effort they've put into the business since it was established in Darwin in 2008. They're now operating in three states. It's very impressive. Monsoon Aquatics was just one of seven Territory businesses which made it to the finals of the export awards, and I want to congratulate them all. We're very proud of our Territory businesses. We have ingenuity and innovation, and Monsoon Aquatics have done us proud.
