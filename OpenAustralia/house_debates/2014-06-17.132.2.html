        I rise today to speak about the passing of Leslie Ronald Zines, a great constitutional scholar and teacher. Of Leslie Zines it was said by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mason" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Mason
        </a>
        , the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … with the retirement of the eminent constitutionalist Geoffrey Sawer, Professor Zines became the leading commentator on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Geoffrey Lindell and Oliver Mendelsohn noted in their obituary in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Zines rightly belongs in the company of eminent Australian constitutional scholars before him, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harrison_Moore" rel="nofollow">
         William Harrison Moore

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Bailey" rel="nofollow">
         Kenneth Bailey
        </a>
        and Sawer—
       </p>
       <p>
        Leslie Zines was born in Sydney on 12 December 1930, the son of a Jewish tailor who migrated to Australia from Palestine. He attended state primary schools and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney High School
        </a>
        and graduated from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Sydney
        </a>
        in 1952, with first-class honours in law. In 1956 he received a master of laws from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" rel="nofollow">
         Harvard University
        </a>
        and, while attracted by the bar, ultimately found his way into the teaching profession. He believed, as I do, that law is not a set of abstract and arid rules set in aspic by past generations but develops through courts taking into account values and policy considerations. He was a tough but admired teacher over three decades at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
         ANU
        </a>
        and a great exponent of the Socratic method of case teaching.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course his best known scholarly work is
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         High Court and the Constitution
        </i>
        , which went through five editions since it was first published in 1981, a book which I am sure has been the bane of many a law student but which ended up being a fundamental text for so many Australian lawyers. He was a barrister in several important High Court cases, most notably the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Franklin Dam
        </a>
        case. Of Leslie Zines it was written in the
        <i>
         Federal Law Review
        </i>
        by Geoffrey Lindell that his style of legal analysis was best summed up in the way in which he marked Lindell's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLM" rel="nofollow">
         LLM
        </a>
        thesis. Lindell said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although difficult to decipher I soon realized that they—
       </p>
       <p>
        Zines's marginal notes—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        all signified, in relation to views and propositions I was expressing an advancing, an all important word—'why?'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This not only taught me much about the art and skill of how to supervise … but also went to the heart of the academic endeavour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to Professor Zines and to his partner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Judith Wilson
