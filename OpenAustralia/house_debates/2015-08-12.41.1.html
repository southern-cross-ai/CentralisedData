        On 5 August I was fortunate to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Prince of Wales Hospital
        </a>
        in our community to celebrate the golden jubilee of the first kidney transplant in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . This was performed at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Henry_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Prince Henry Hospital
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Little Bay
        </a>
        in my electorate in 1965. The Department of Nephrology was established at the Prince Henry Hospital in 1962 and moved to Randwick to join the Prince of Wales Hospital and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Children's Hospital
        </a>
        in 1998. It is now the longest continuously active kidney transplant service in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        . Throughout its 50-year history, the Department of Nephrology has performed some world and national firsts, including the first successful kidney transplant on a baby in the world in 1967. Considering that the previous 10 attempts throughout the world had failed and resulted in the death of the baby, this was a ground-breaking medical achievement. It performed the first live donor adult kidney transplant in Australia in 1967. In 1968, the first baby was born in Australia to a woman with a kidney transplant. In 2013, the Sydney Children's Hospital conducted the world's first adult-to-child kidney transplant with an unmatched blood type.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, the departments of nephrology at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Sydney Children's Hospital have performed 1,400 kidney transplants. They have saved many lives. I wish to pay tribute to the medical staff over the last 50 years who have been involved in this wonderful, groundbreaking medical research and performance.
