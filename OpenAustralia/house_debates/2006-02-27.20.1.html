       <p>
        Last Friday I had the pleasure of attending the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Camira Scout Group in my electorate of Oxley. As you can see, I am actually wearing the honorary scarf and woggle today in the House. I would like to place on the public record my admiration for the work of the local people involved with this group and with the scouting movement generally. The scouts aim to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... encourage the physical, intellectual, social, emotional and spiritual development of young people so that they take a constructive place in society as responsible citizens, and as a member of their local, national and international communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is very much an admirable aim, and I am very supportive of the work that these people do.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I want to acknowledge the hard work of the people in the Camira Scout Group: Mr Ken Miller, who is the District Commissioner; Mr Greg Broad, who is the Regional Commissioner; Ms Donna Harris, who is the Camira Scout Group Leaderâ€”and I congratulate her on her elevation to that position; and Ms Bonney Degen, who is the Treasurer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Camira Scout Group is a great organisation. It is doing a great job in our local community. That is why I am so very proud to be wearing this scarf and woggle today. I was presented with these on Friday night and made an honorary scout, and I will be proud to remain that for the rest of my life. The scouts make a great contribution to our local community, shaping the development of young boys and girls. There is no gender difference in scouts anymore; it is just boys and girls all together. They work very hard to make sure that Camira is a great place to live.
