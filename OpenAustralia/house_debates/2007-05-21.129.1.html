        I rise tonight to draw the attention of the House to some of the positive things that are happening in our community. We are often regaled in the media by stories about communities that are falling apart and people who spend too much time on the computer, on the internet or watching
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
         DVD
        </a>
        s as opposed to engaging in community activities. Sometimes to actually understand what communities can do we need to leave the present and go back to the past. Over this last weekend I had the opportunity to go back to the past for a retelling of the Cinderella story, which was first told by the Greek historian Strabo and dates back to the first century
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC" rel="nofollow">
         BC
        </a>
        . There have been many retellings since then.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am referring in particular to the Two Wells Melodrama Group. This group has put on 24 productions over the years, normally one a year. The beauty of this group is that it is completely community based, they are all amateurs and even the scripts of their presentations are written by the members of the cast. It is a real celebration of the community and to a large extent it is also a real investment in the community. When you go along and see one of the town doctors helping out as a waiter or some of the town dignitaries serving, working in the kitchen or on the stage you get a sense that people are really coming together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could list all the people but I will get into trouble because I am sure I will miss some. But there are a few names that I wish to mention in particular. There is the Arbon family—Anne, Hayden and Eleisha—who all played a large part in this performance and performances prior. It demonstrates a very positive aspect of families across generations who can work together on something very constructive. Bill Fielke and Mark Boon actually wrote the script and have done so for many of the productions. There are people like Kay Melton, who was not only responsible for programs, posters and biographies but also for photography and publicity as well as acting in one of the key roles in the show. You get a sense of the amount of commitment that these people put in when you realise that on the morning of the opening night performance Mark and Kay were out helping to run a riding for disabled event in a neighbouring town. They left the event and came back to help set up the hall, star in the show, help run the performance and help pack up. Then, the next day, they were back out with another riding for disabled event. It just tells of the level of commitment that many people in our community have that so often goes unrecognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention

        , the musical director. In the days when people so often rely on recorded music, he has taken the time and effort to draw together a growing group of musicians to provide the music for the melodramas. I would also like to recognise Maria Pellizzari, who looks after the catering, and Joe Daniele, who looks after the bar. Collectively, through the takings on the door, the three-course meal they provide, the bar and the entertainment, they have raised thousands of dollars over the years for the community. So it is not just the benefit of bringing people together in a celebration of the community or the enjoyment that people get out of it; it is significant to list some of the community organisations that this melodrama group has supported. There is the Gawler River Country Fire Service, the Two Wells

        . There is a list of groups and there are more on the list that have benefited from the funds raised by this group.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is appropriate that the House notes that there are still many positive aspects in our communities. We need to celebrate the commitment, the ‘have a go’ attitude of these people and the generosity of them giving up their time and making that effort. Yes, they enjoy it and they have a lot of fun but the whole community benefits in many tangible ways.
