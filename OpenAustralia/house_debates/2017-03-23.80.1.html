           <p>
            Yesterday, the member for Dunkley, the Treasurer,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Cosgrove" rel="nofollow">
             Lady Cosgrove
            </a>
            and members from both sides of this House attended an event for the launch of a new initiative put forward by Kookaburra Kids. At the event, we heard from two children who have participated in their programs, Jasmine and Ronan Duff. Their mum Karen was also with us. As everyone who was there would know, the story that these young children told was incredibly moving. The courage in which they told it was something which left a mark on everyone who was there. They told of the issues they have to confront living with a parent with mental health conditions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kookaburra Kids is a fantastic organisation which runs recreational and educational camps, activities and events for children who have a parent with mental illness. It provides age-appropriate mental health education, focusing on developing coping skills and resilience while also allowing children to bond with peers who are facing similar challenges. Most importantly, Kookaburra Kids has put up its hand to assist in the case of children whose parents are current or former ADF members with mental health conditions. Yesterday, at the event, the government confirmed its support for this important work—and I know it was bipartisan—providing $2.1 million in funding to expand their activities to children of the Defence Force.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kookaburra Kids is using the funding to develop, deliver and evaluate a pilot program for these children. It will include activity days, weekend camps and family picnics, with enhancements, where necessary, to support the unique needs of the Defence services and the ex-serving community. The pilot program will begin in

            </a>
            and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Capital Territory
            </a>
            in the middle of the year. The program will be open to kids between eight and 18 who have a parent with mental illness as a result of their military service. Most importantly, the program will be free. I thank the Treasurer, in particular, for his support of this program, because it was his initiative which first brought it to my attention, and I say, on behalf of all the House, that I know that what Kookaburra Kids will do with this money will be incredibly important going forward.

The trials that they have been through have been significant, but the support that that program offers is phenomenal. So, on behalf of the opposition, I offer our bipartisan support for this program.
