       <p>
        On indulgence: this is a great opportunity to remark in this House about the events of yesterday in Rome where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_MacKillop" rel="nofollow">
         Mary MacKillop
        </a>
        was made a saint by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness_Pope_Benedict_XVI" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope" rel="nofollow">
         The Pope
        </a>
        ’s gesture simply formalises what Australian Catholics have known for generations and completes a century-long journey of hope and aspiration for the Australian Catholic community and the Josephite order. The canonisation of our first saint is an historic event for our nation and I think a moment of joy for every Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the five million Australians of Catholic heritage, it affirms that Mary’s life of self-sacrifice has been deemed worthy of emulation and respect across the globe. For those of us who are not Catholic but respect the place of the church in our nation’s life it is also a moment of great pride, and I got the opportunity to share in that in Melbourne yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        For most people, I suspect, saints are seen as remote figures from ancient times and from very far off lands. Yet Mary was one of us. She inhabited the places we call home: Fitzroy, Penola, Adelaide,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        . She was born in this land, she served in this land and she died in this land. Now her remarkable life has become a gift to the whole world.
       </p>
       <p>
        A less likely account could hardly be imagined. Here was a young woman with relatively little formal education, few resources and no connections and yet through sheer vision and strength of will she was able to write an amazing chapter in our nation’s history. When she died in 1909 the sisters of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph
        </a>
        felt immediately that they had lost a saint and the Australian community knew it had lost a national treasure of rare brilliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        A century later Mary stands alongside all the great saints of history. Her story of bush schools and fights with clerical bureaucracy are the equal of theirs. Her wisdom and fearless integrity shine clearly across the decades, along with her good-humoured practically and egalitarian decency that so distinctively proclaim that she could have only come from one place, and that is our very own home, Australia, land of the world’s newest saint; a nation today and yesterday united in pride and joy and celebration.

        <p>
         On indulgence: I rise to echo the words of the Prime Minister and to acknowledge that yesterday in Rome the canonisation of a remarkable Australian woman is important for Catholics, for Australians and for the wider world.
        </p>
        <p>
         From the humblest of beginnings at a time when women were expected to defer,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_MacKillop" rel="nofollow">
          Mary MacKillop
         </a>
         began a teaching order that, by the time of her death in 1909, had more than 700 members teaching more than 12,000 Australian pupils in 117 schools around Australia but mostly in the bush and mostly catering to people who would otherwise not have had an education.
        </p>
        <p>
         She was a remarkably determined woman. She was undoubtedly a great educator. Therefore she is quite appropriately a role model for women and for teachers today.
        </p>
        <p>
         She performed this prodigious work because she felt called to it by God. In an era when the church and its representatives are often thought to have failed people, her canonisation is a timely reminder of the good that has been done in this country and elsewhere under the influence of Christian faith.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it is appropriate to acknowledge, even in the parliament of a secular democracy, that Australia has indeed been shaped by Christian faith, even though many of us as individuals may not share it. Therefore all Australians are entitled to share in the pride that Australian Catholics feel today.
        </p>
