        Australians have known for some time that they cannot trust the federal coalition government when it comes to Medicare and the healthcare system. But in

        </a>
        this month they are discovering that the New South Wales coalition are just as bad. On the eve of a state by-election, we have the New South Wales government rolling out plans to privatise hospitals in Shellharbour, Bowral, Maitland, Wyong and Goulburn. This is a revisitation of the failed plan to privatise the Port Macquarie Base Hospitalâ€”a plan which was such a disaster that the New South Wales government had to take it back over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the last election, Minister Skinner promised that a re-elected Baird government would give the green light to major regional redevelopments of

        </a>
        with '$251 million in investment'. The parliamentary secretary for the Illawarra said that it was a dream comes true and that he could not be prouder. At no stage did they mention that their real plan was the privatisation of hospitals in regional Australia. I have to say that the residents in the Illawarra are very sceptical about this plan, believing it will lead to increased waiting lists and reduced staffing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally, when have a tough policy to deliver you stand there and defend it; but not the Baird government. They do not even have the courage to stand a candidate in the Wollongong by-election. Well, Paul Scully will fight for the Wollongong hospitals and he will fight for the Illawarra.
