        Last week, Turkey launched an unlawful attack on Kurdish held territory in north-east Syria. Since then, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced from their homes and at least 30 people have been killed, including young children. The decision by the United States to withdraw troops from the border, giving President Erdogan a green light to invade, is set to trigger a further humanitarian and geopolitical disaster in a region that has already suffered an eight-year war.

        Despite all of this, the response from Canberra has been pitiful. Although Trump's decision has been condemned not only by the international community but also by his own political party, our government still cannot manage a single word of criticism.

They were also at a critical point in their long and bloody fight for self-determination and autonomy. But now they've been betrayed by the erratic

        , who again shows he has no regard for the consequences of his actions. The government must condemn Trump's decision, stand up to Turkey and make it clear that this illegal invasion is absolutely unacceptable.
