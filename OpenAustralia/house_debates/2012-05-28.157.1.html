        It is with great pleasure I thank a whole range of people that helped with the Brisbane 2 Ipswich Challenge yesterday, Sunday 27 May. It is a ride I initiated and this was our 11th year. All of my office put in an extreme amount of hard work to make it happen. I want to thank all my office, particularly Lisa, Lucy and Margy, Pam, Chris, Amy, all the volunteers and all the fantastic people that made it happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had over 650 riders register. The money raised goes to the Ipswich Hospital Foundation and also to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Heart Foundation
        </a>
        . It is a great way of bringing the community together and something I enjoy doing very much. For me, it not only combines a sport and a passion that I love, in bike riding, but it also brings the community together and helps a whole range of people. It is not about how fast you can ride; it is always about families and about getting people who may not have ridden in 20 or 30 years back to doing something active, something good for themselves and something good for the people around them as well.

        You could not do an event like this, as everybody knows, unless you had some great sponsors, some people who were prepared to help you out. This year's major sponsor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekisui_House" rel="nofollow">
         Sekisui House
        </a>
        , which is doing a wonderful development in the Ripley Valley, has been so supportive and made a big difference in making sure the event was a success. I also thank Komatsu, which opened a new plant in my electorate employing 350 people. They were great sponsors. They wanted very little out of this event; they just wanted to be part of it. I found that so refreshing. When I asked them what they wanted, they said they just wanted to be part of something good in the community. They thought it matched up with their ideals as well.

        There were some long-term supporters such as Springfield Land Corporation. We always ride through Springfield, and this year was the first time we stopped at the new Robelle Domain, which is one of South-East Queensland's best parks. I invite everyone to come and have a look at it; it is just amazing. Also thanks to Toscani's; Walkers; Alphapharm; Bruce at

        are good guys and are also involved with GreenEDGE cycling. They really understand what cycling can do for communities and what cycling events can bring to a community. Also a big thanks to the Westpac guys for doing the barbecueâ€”you did a fantastic job;

        supplements and sportswear; and Aussie Farmers Direct. Bring back the milko! Aussie Farmers is a local guy who decided it was better value to bring people their milk, their bread and their eggs, and now he brings fruit, veg and meat as well. The guy is wonderful. He has been a great sponsor and has great produce too. Coca-Cola were fantastic, as were Capilano honey.
