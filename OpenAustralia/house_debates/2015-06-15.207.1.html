       <p>
        I went to the last election promising to fund some mobile
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        s in my electorate and I am pleased to say that two of these units were delivered to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        Police Force and are now operational. These units were designed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory Police
        </a>
        and I have to commend them for their work. It is absolutely excellent. They are the first of their kind, mobile CCTVs that are towable by any vehicle. They are solar powered. They have a battery backup which lasts for a week. They feature a camera which can be remotely panned, tilted and zoomed. They also have two fixed CCTV cameras and one infra-red, high-definition camera.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these can be operated remotely and have the pictures viewed in live time, allowing police to react to crimes as they occur. We found, when we were inspecting the units, that they could broadcast very sudden and very ominous warnings. We were quite shocked when we had the 'Caution! You are now under police surveillance!' warning. That was enough to make a group of innocent politicians and journalists jump, so I would love to see the effect of these sounders on people who are doing the wrong thing. I am very pleased to have worked with the Northern Territory government to deliver this excellent initiative that was funded under the proceeds of crime fund.
