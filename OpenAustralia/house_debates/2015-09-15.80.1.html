         I thank the member for Forrest for her question. As she well knows, the three free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea are critical for the

           We want to grow our trade because it means more jobs and it means more opportunities for

            North Asian

           trading partners. In fact, it was through decades of strong trade with Japan that Western Australia built its iron ore and oil and gas industries.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
            South Korea
           </a>
           has played a significant role in Western Australia's prosperity, consistently appearing as one of our top five export markets for two decades.
          </p>
          <p>
           China, which already accounts for more than half of all exports from Western Australia, offers significant opportunities for the west across diverse industries and sectors, from resources to agriculture to wine to services. Western Australian businesses and workers will stand to benefit from this free trade agreement with China. Wines of Western Australia chief executive Larry Jorgensen says the China free trade agreement means:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … we are on the pathway towards having a level playing field in China with regard to our international competitors.

            John Harrison
           </a>
           , said that the agreement was 'a real game changer'. Free trade agreements with other Asian countries had 'greatly stimulated domestic job creation and opportunities for Western Australian businesses'—that was WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Deidre Willmott. She said:

             What I cannot understand is why Labor is doing everything it can to prevent

             </a>
             s and Australians from reaping the benefit of this free trade agreement. The Leader of the Opposition is showing that he puts the interests of the union bosses ahead of the interests of Western Australian workers. His readiness to sell down Western Australia's future economic prosperity should send a shiver down the spine of every Western Australian worker whose job depends on selling goods and services to our
