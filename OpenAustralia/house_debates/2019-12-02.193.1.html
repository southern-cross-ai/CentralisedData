        I'd like to acknowledge the Territorians who were honoured at the recent

         Australian Training Awards
        </a>

        To the Territory winners: Rory Milner added to his growing awards, winning the Apprentice of the Year. Well done, Rory.

        took out the runner-up position as the Trainee of the Year. We had many finalists from the Territory. Ashlee Gilder was a finalist for the Australian School-based Apprentice of the Year Award; Jacqui Culgan was a finalist for the Vocational Student of the Year Award; Raelene Collins was a finalist for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Student of the Year Award; Patricia Fawcett was a finalist for the VET Teacher/Trainer of the Year Award; and Wendy Kennedy was nominated as a finalist for the Excellence in Language, Literacy and Numeracy Practice Award.

        Well done to everyone from the Northern Territory working in the vocational education and training sector. It is so important to our future, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell. It is vital, and it doesn't help when those VET funding streams get cut, because these kids are our future. We need young Australians having these trades for the future.
