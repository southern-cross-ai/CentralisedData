       <p>
        I rise today to celebrate the life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Church" rel="nofollow">
         George Church
        </a>
        , a great stalwart of the Kojonup community, who passed away last week at the ripe old age of 96. George was a lifelong farmer and contemporary of my dad at the Narrogin agricultural school in the 1930s.
       </p>
       <p>
        All his working life, George never missed a Katanning sheep sale. Although latterly he had health issues, it was great to see him at the official opening of the new Katanning saleyards in May last year. I remember as a kid waiting for the school bus and, like clockwork, George driving past at eight o'clock every Thursday on his way to the saleyards.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a youngster, his family owned 3,200 acres on the outskirts of Kojonup, where he worked the sheep on horseback. He was a great athlete, cricketer, footballer and hockey player during his days at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Narrogin agricultural college.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1939 he joined the 25th Light Horse Machine Gun Regiment. He fought for this great country and was a prisoner of war. He returned to farm Korrinup, and married his beloved Tricia in 1957. Although having no children themselves, their farm was always full of children and laughter. They were both heavily involved in Rotary. George was a president and had a 40 year, 100 per cent, perfect attendance record, and Tricia counselled through Rotary Youth Line.
       </p>
       <p>
        A generous man to the end, he bequeathed $500,000 to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Kojonup" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Kojonup
        </a>
        towards building an aged-care and medical facility for the community. Three hundred thousand dollars sits in Rotary bequests from his family. Part of Korrinup now houses the Kojonup Senior High School and their farm. George leaves a tremendous legacy, and will be remembered as a true gentleman and a generous contributor to his community. Vale George Church.
