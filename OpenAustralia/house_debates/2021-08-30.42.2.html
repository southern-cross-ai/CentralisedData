        [by video link] Back in July, a local worker named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Smith
        </a>
        came to my mobile office at Banyo and asked me to sign a pledge of support for local Toll Group workers, who are heading to Fair Work to protect their job security, work conditions and industry standards.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday" rel="nofollow">
         Last Thursday
        </a>
        night, two hours after my home quarantine finished at midnight, I stuck by my word to Chris and proudly stood, shoulder to shoulder, with Toll workers and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        delegates at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Airport
        </a>
        as they walked off the job site at midnight to begin a 24-hour strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the pandemic, our delivery drivers and truckies have put their lives on the line to keep our country moving and to deliver food,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
         PPE
        </a>
        and vaccines. They have kept our country and our economy in motion when our brick-and-mortar shops have closed in lockdown. Instead of rewarding their workers with job security and safe working conditions, Toll is planning to sell them out in a bid to compete in a race to the bottom with exploitative models like Amazon Flex. Toll is trying to do what Qantas tried and failed to do to my aviation workers: scrap their working entitlements and engage outside workers on minimal pay and with fewer rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of my transport workers, aviation workers and all north-side workers, we know that only a Labor government would implement the same job, same pay policy that will actually improve job security for hardworking north-siders; that's what they deserve.
