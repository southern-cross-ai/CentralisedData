        I was honoured to have Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in my electorate recently for the official opening of Rockingham's first bulk-billed urgent care clinic. The new clinic is one of seven urgent care clinics the Albanese Labor government is delivering for all Western Australians. I'm pleased to report that the clinic located at the Rockingham Medical and Dental Centre is already providing much-needed care to the people of Rockingham and Kwinana and is helping to reduce pressure on our hospital and emergency departments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was really pleased to see at that opening the

         Mark McGowan
        </a>
        ; and the then candidate for Rockingham Magenta Marshall. I'm really pleased to report that Magenta Marshall has since been elected as the new member for Rockingham, after successfully securing the seat at the Rockingham by-election on 29 July. Magenta was an outstanding local candidate and ran a fantastic campaign, with her team knocking on almost 10,000 household doors and making more than 6,000 calls for the by-election. I've known Magenta for quite some time now. I know that she will work day in and day out for the great people of Rockingham. Like me, Magenta was born and raised in the community she now represents. I'm looking forward to working alongside her as the new local state MP for where I live and in the Cook Labor government, which will continue to deliver for the people of Rockingham.
       </p>

        Not only was the 29 July result a big win for WA Labor in Rockingham but also it was a massive rout for the Liberal Party of WA. Obtaining a dismal 17.68 per cent of the primary vote, the Liberal Party suffered their second-worst primary vote in my hometown since the seat's inception in 1976. They only did worse with the absolutely astounding performance of a nine per cent primary vote in 2021. The WA Libs didn't even come in second place. They didn't even scramble to second place in the Rockingham by-election. It was a damning indictment of the WA Liberals and the so-called clan faction that runs the party in the west. Will the WA Liberals ever learn that Western Australians will not put up with the nonsense the WA Liberals are going through?
       </p>
       <p>
        This by-election came after the resignation of the former Premier and member for Rockingham, Mark McGowan. On behalf of the people of Brand and also the people of Rockingham, I thank Mark for his service over 30 years to the local electorate and to the wider community of Western Australia. He has steered us through some very difficult times. I want to wish Mark and his family, who have served alongside him, all the best for the future. I look forward to seeing him at the Mike Barnett Sports Complex, which is named after the member for Rockingham before Mark. It's an important tradition in the town to support the local, much loved basketball club the Rockingham Flames, and I congratulate the Cook Labor government on supporting them with a $10 million upgrade for one of the most popular sports in the state. Flame on!
