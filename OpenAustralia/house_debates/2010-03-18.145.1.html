        Last Friday I invited school leaders from local high schools to a working luncheon. Representatives from most schools were able to attend, and another luncheon is being organised for those unable to take part in the discussion. At the luncheon we had representatives from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorokan_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Gorokan High School
        </a>
        , Northlakes High School, Lake Munmorah High School, Swansea High School, Whitebridge High School and St Mary’s High School. The purpose of this luncheon was to develop formal dialogue with youth leaders in the electorate, to learn from them what issues are important in their school communities and to provide a venue in which to share experiences. It was very edifying for me to see the level of commitment that these leaders have not only to their school community but also to the community in which they live. At the luncheon we decided that we would set up quarterly meetings with the local schools to discuss issues that were important to youth in the area and that they would act as an advisory board to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to share with the House some of the ideas that were discussed at the meeting. I would like to start by putting forward one of the activities that were undertaken by the school leaders of Swansea High School whereby the whole school community was in the high school hall and all were given pieces of paper and on their piece of paper each person had to write what they were passionate about and what they valued. Once that had been written on the paper, the paper was made into a paper aeroplane and was thrown across the hall. Every student picked up an aeroplane, a piece of paper, and read what was on it. After the exercise was completed, the school leaders sat down and composed a list of the issues. I think that is an excellent, innovative idea that that school undertook, given it involved everyone in the school community and it gave them an idea of the things that were important to students in their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that we did at the meeting was talk about the issues that were important to students in their local area, issues such as apprenticeships,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , youth connection programs, work programs in libraries and the need to have vocational courses that were important in a number of these schools. I was very impressed that the students from Whitebridge High School raised a local government issue, which was the extension of Warren Road and the impact that would have on their school community. They told me about the exercise that they had undertaken in lobbying the local council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youth centres, skate parks and other issues were raised, along with promotion of sports clubs. We then discussed what issues the representatives, the school leaders, felt were important. Sport was identified as an issue, because it improved health and happiness. It was also pointed out that good health led to good mental health. Support needs were raised, as there was a need for support for families and students within a school. The importance of the surf life saving movement was emphasised because the Shortland electorate, as I have already mentioned in previous debates, is a coastal electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students also highlighted particular subjects and areas that they were passionate about, such as trades and the environment. It was also highlighted that women’s sport did not get the same level of support as men’s sport. The cultural area was also highlighted as an area of great importance to young people. Motivation and enthusiasm amongst young people should be highlighted and harnessed. It was an excellent activity, one that I was really pleased to be involved with. I thank all the students who came along to that luncheon.
