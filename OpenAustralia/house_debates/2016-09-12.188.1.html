        In my role as federal member, occasionally I get some curly phone calls coming through to my office. I received one the other day. Obviously, being in a marginal seat, I always do what I can to help the people who make contact, whether it be about a local government issue, a state government issue or, more often than not, a federal government issue. Recently, my office was contacted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reid" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Reid
        </a>
        , who had concerns about something which is a little esoteric. Robert Reid has been in Australia for 50 or 60 years, but he came from Scotland, so he has a particular interest in things from Scotland. Robert wished to talk to me about the fact that the city of Brisbane is named after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Brisbane" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Thomas Brisbane
        </a>
        but that references to his full name,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Makdougall_Brisbane" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane
        </a>
        , a Scottish name, have been dropped. Robert was most keen to see what I could do to make sure that this Scottish connection was not dropped. I met Robert at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        at Corinda. We had a beer together and I said that I would see what I could do. I know some Makdougalls and I know they are proud of their Scottish links. Robert Reid has been in Australia since 1970. He came from a little town near Glasgow and is very proud of his Scottish connections. So I will do what I can for Robert Reid to make sure Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane's name lives on.
