        Recently I had the privilege of opening the
        <i>
         Land is Life
        </i>
        exhibition at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_West" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong West
        </a>
        branch of the Geelong library. This multimedia exhibition by Oxfam shows
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Island
        </a>
        communities in Kiribati and Tuvalu and their vulnerability to the impact of climate change. Through images of a seemingly carefree way of life, enjoyed very much in the outdoors, we are confronted by the harsh reality that climate change, most particularly rising sea levels, will severely impact the day-to-day lives of these islanders and threaten the very future of their island homes. It is a brilliant exhibition that was displayed at several sites throughout Geelong's library network. Having the library as the exhibition venue reminded me of the powerful collaborative role that libraries can play in the generation of new and creative ideas, producing events and programs that have significant cultural and artistic contributions. They are also an invaluable resource to our community and bring countless benefits to a diverse membership both socially and economically. Thirteen libraries form part of the Geelong Regional Libraries network. Together they provide a range of resources and services to a membership base of more than 92,000 people. These members made nearly 1.3 million visits to our regional libraries in the 12 months to last year, and the library membership base is diverse, because social inclusion and equal learning and participation opportunities are a strong focus. People of all ages and backgrounds are encouraged to join and participate. Whether it is author events, preschool story times, writing workshops or community education lectures, members and the broader community are encouraged to participate and experience the enjoyment that comes from learning and discovering something new.

        Our libraries stock more than just books, though these are of course their core business. There are also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
         DVD
        </a>
        's, magazines, newspapers and broadband internet access in every library, and this access gives members information and materials to support their studies and personal development or simply to enrich their leisure time. Our libraries create a safe and welcoming environment where everyone, whoever they are, whatever their circumstance, has an opportunity to learn, participate and feel positive about their presence and contribution. Libraries connect individuals, often through providing social or collaborative conditions, or purely through the sense of community created by the library environment. There are areas for community groups to meet and work or communicate and, in addition to building a more connected and collaborative community, there are economic spin-off's as well. A recent study of Geelong Regional Libraries found they generated nearly $7.50 of economic benefit for every dollar invested and provided 168 jobs for people across the region. I was simply delighted to see that last week the Regional Infrastructure Fund committed $10 million to the Geelong library system, particularly in the upgrade of the heritage centre, which is so sorely needed. Another function of our library system is that it is the custodian of much of our most important history, and this money will secure our history for decades to come.

        Diverse, creative and supportive community education is essential to building an engaged and empowered community, and our libraries play a central and vital role. This speech was prepared by Zac Power, a work experience student with me.
