        I rise to become a personal recruitment agency for one of my constituents, Mr Barry Chappell, who contacted me last year but unfortunately 90-second statements were cancelled. He is having trouble getting a job. He is 52 years old and has been unemployed for nearly three years. Some of you might have seen him on Channel Seven's
        <i>

        </i>
        on 24 April last year. He has made over 600 job applications. Unfortunately, he rarely gets an acknowledgement. He does not receive any benefits. He has two bachelor's degrees, a postgraduate certificate and three master's degrees, covering accounting, economics, law, policing, intelligence and counter-terrorism. He has completed nearly two years of an arts degree in Australian and Asian politics and history, and many of his subjects relate to the Asian century. He said in his email:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All I hear from politicians from both parties is rhetoric. I want work!
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, I am doing my bit for you, Barry, to make sure that your plight is publicised. He said he is very tired of being unemployed. He wants to work. He is obviously very skilled and probably not suitable for a labouring job, but, if people have anything to offer Barry, who is in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, they should contact my office and I will do what I can to make sure we put you in contact with Barry. I know he is listening in to this now and he is keen to make contact with as many people as possible. As he said, he is a bit concerned about people only having rhetoric, but obviously, Barry, I am not an employment agency; I am only able to mention your name here.
