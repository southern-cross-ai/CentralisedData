       <p>
        I congratulate all of those who participated in the annual Rockingham Kwinana Chamber of Commerce Regional Business Awards on Saturday, 26 August. Speaking to the more than 200-strong attendees at the awards dinner I reflected on my childhood in Rockingham, where my mum and nan owned and ran the Family Traders drapery store on Railway Terrace in Rockingham. This small business was remembered by many in the room on Saturday night, who were gathered because of their own business commitments in our community.

        Once again, the Rockingham Kwinana Chamber of Commerce organised a fantastic event where excellence in the local business community was recognised. I would like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , my fellow Rockingham Beach Primary School graduate, Tony Solin, for making such an excellent event happen. The business of the year winner was Malibu Podiatry, and Glen Sell was named business person of the year. The microbusiness winner was the very popular Shoalwater Physio. The Rockingham Beach Cup, an amazing horse race along the beautiful Rockingham foreshore, an outstanding community event, was honoured with the outstanding corporate community event awardâ€”no surprises there. Organised by the

        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Beach
        </a>
        , the inaugural event of the Rockingham Beach Cup was such a success in 2016 that an even bigger and better expanded event is planned for next year. I congratulate the Rotary Club of Palm Beach for all their efforts over many years in Rockingham. The young businessperson of the year prize this year went to Scott Patrick of Be Media, and both Sharon Robertson and Robyn Patterson won judges' commendation awards. There were numerous other winners on the night and countless nominees, who reflect the strong and vibrant business community that is growing up in the electorate of Brand.
