        I rise to discuss the reluctance of Labor, whether state or federal, to invest in regional Queensland ahead of one of the biggest resource booms that Queensland and our nation have ever seen. The Surat and Galilee basins, both within the boundaries of Maranoa, are a significant boost to the economy and we will potentially see a massive boost in population growth. A Deloitte Access Economics report, the 2020 growth outlook study into the state's minerals and energy sector, reveals that the Surat basin—that is, Dalby, Miles, Chinchilla, Roma and Wandoan—will need some 5,500 new resource sector workers by 2020, not to mention the population boost that will be necessary to staff the supporting industries. Also, forward projections found that the figure of 5,500 would at least triple when support workers are counted, and 55 per cent of the workforce is expected to comprise non-resident workers. That brings in the question of fly in, fly out workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        What have the state and federal Labor governments done to prepare for this growth? With more than half the workforce expected to live outside of the resource communities, how will people be encouraged to relocate to the region? Where is the investment in the liveability of our region to attract young families into the community so that they can have the same support that you would expect in the capital cities—or indeed on the

        , where you live, Mr Deputy Speaker?
       </p>
       <p>
        Our roads are in a terrible state of repair. We are still waiting for the second range crossing to be constructed, and yet every day the volume of traffic is increasing exponentially to bring in the materials to build the mining infrastructure. But we are not seeing the other elements being developed: the liveability of our communities and the road infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where is the investment in the community services? In the Galilee Basin, for instance, Barcaldine does not have a day care centre, which is essential if young families are going to be attracted to a community. As we know, both parents these days are more likely to work. So if they cannot have these facilities in their communities the young families leave the west—and yet this is where the great wealth of our community is being generated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking with local medical centres it is easy to see how the growth in the resources sector is impacting on our health services. In fact, some people in parts of the Maranoa electorate have a rate of preventable mortality of 1.8 to two times the norm. This figure is from a recent study. That is an appalling situation because of the lack of access to these services. I have heard reports recently from medical centres in Dalby that new patients are waiting up to eight weeks to see a doctor. This has serious flow-on effects, because new patients presenting with urgent medical problems have to be seen by doctors at the hospital where services are already stretched. It is time that the Labor government invested money from royalties in the resource sector in the liveability of our communities.
