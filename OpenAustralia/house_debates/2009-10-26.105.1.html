        I rise tonight to pay tribute to a distinguished Australian, Charles Copeman AM, who last week was inducted into the mining hall of fame in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The Australian Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame, in partnership with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        Billiton, hosted a dinner in Perth last Thursday to honour the five inductees, of which Charles Copeman was one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Charles Copeman was a director and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of an Australian mining company, Peko-Wallsend Ltd, which in 1983 took over a public company,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robe_River" rel="nofollow">
         Robe River
        </a>
        Ltd, which held 35 per cent of the Pilbara based Robe River mining and shipping joint venture. It was one of the largest iron ore producers in the world but was unprofitable as a result of being massively overmanned and dominated by union activism, which resulted in restrictive workplace agreements that Peko assessed would not be endorsed if brought before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Industrial Relations Commission
        </a>
        . Charles Copeman was and is a man of courage who determined to see the company become profitable, and that meant getting rid of 284 restrictive work practices, such as the infamous shortage of ice-cream flavours and, more seriously, not permitting the use of mechanical rope-handling machines for loading ships of up to 250,000 tonnes but instead requiring the ropes to be manhandled. This was both costly and unsafe.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1986 Charles Copeman and Peko-Wallsend stood up to the unions and, with great courage, stood fast in an heroic battle to rid the industry of bullyboy union rorts, profit-destroying strikes, unfair Industrial Relations Commission orders and a management intimidated by the unions. A mammoth five-week strike ensued, and the president of the iron ore mining unions association, Mr Jack Marks, claimed publicly that the aim of the strike was to destroy Peko. The strike was finally resolved with no tangible gain to the unions; the mines had continued to operate. At the end of the strike, it became apparent that the strikers did not have a monopoly on the means of production and, of the nine matters taken to the Industrial Relations Commission on appeal to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian Supreme Court
        </a>
        , Peko won eight and could, in Charles Copeman’s words, live with the ninth. Robe River had first doubled and then tripled production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other companies in the Pilbara remained nervous and only followed the need to reform slowly. They were fearful of the unions and of negative publicity. But one by one they realised that they could not ignore the need to embrace reform in industrial relations.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Court
        </a>
        ’s state government reforms. BHP took until 1999 to realise that it too had to reform its management and move to individual agreements. Once reform was embraced, profits, productivity and production all rose markedly. The reform process continued until 2008, when the current Labor government turned back the clock and dealt unions back in.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the legacy of Charles Copeman cannot be wiped out. His stand was a watershed; it toughened management and began the road to reform. To quote
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Wood" rel="nofollow">

        carved out a space in which the companies could begin to open the dialogue between management and workers without the interference of the arbitration system and the unions.
