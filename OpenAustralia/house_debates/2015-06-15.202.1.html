       <p>
        Yesterday I was privileged to attend the birthday party of Thelma Spencer. It wasn't just an ordinary birthday party. Thelma Spencer turned 108. The party was held at the 16 Foot Sailing Club and Thelma walked into that club unaided. She lives independently at home with her son, whom she has lived with since she was 65 years of age. Recently, Yasmin Catley, during the state election campaign, knocked on her door. Thelma came to the door and said, 'Excuse the way I'm dressed. I was just repairing the washing machine.' This is an 108-year-old woman who is vibrant, physically active and has a very keen intellect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thelma was born in Redfern and she is very involved with her family. She had 30 members of her family surrounding her yesterday at the 16 Foot Sailing Club. I felt very privileged to be able to visit her there and be part of her special day. I know that my colleague Yasmin Catley, the member for Swansea, visited her on Friday and enjoyed many stories and a long talk with her. So, congratulations, Thelma, on reaching the age of 108â€”something that not too many people do, and certainly not too many people reach that age being as fit and healthy as Thelma. Happy birthday, Thelma.
