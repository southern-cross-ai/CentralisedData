        On Sunday, I was again privileged to join our local Bangladeshi community at Mascot Public School for their Good Morning Bangladesh morning tea, raising funds for the Cancer Council. This event has been going since 2001 and, over time, they have raised over $150,000 for cancer research and treatment. Local political leaders and community leaders came together with our Bangladeshi community to raise money for the Cancer Council, but also to celebrate multiculturalism in our community. The wonderful colours of traditional dress and the fantastic dishes such as roti, paratha, curries, tangy chotpoti, pea soup, masala tea and, of course, Bangladeshi sweets were flowing quite freely. The event was attended by around 400 people and raised $8,000 again this year.
       </p>

        It was particularly pleasing to see members of the family of the late Dr Abdul Hawke, who unfortunately passed away earlier in the year but was instrumental in establishing the Good Morning Bangladesh morning tea and organising it every year. I pay my respects to his family. I once again thank Azad, in particular, Sirajul Haque and, in particular, Sheik Rahman for their efforts in organising this wonderful eventâ€”a great celebration of multiculturalism, raising funds for a great cause.
