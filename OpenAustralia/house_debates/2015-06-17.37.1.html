       <p>
        I wish to pay tribute to a great man, Victor Maxwell Boardman, a constituent in my electorate of Macarthur, who sadly passed away at the age of 93 on Sunday. Vic lived and worked on his family dairy farm on the outskirts of Camden his entire life and became a noteworthy and trusted advocate of agriculture in the Macarthur region. Vic displayed his lifelong passion and commitment for the local community by contributing to the Camden Show, the Camden Historical Society, the Oaks Historical Society, the Vintage Car Club and the Crank Handlers Association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vic is well known for his extensive historical knowledge about early Camden, the Oaks and surrounding areas as well his hugely popular 'drovers camp', in which he served exceptional damper and billy tea to the public at the Camden Show for the past 25 years. In 2006 Vic was presented with the Agricultural Societies Council of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        award for his contribution to the Camden Show Society over fifty years. In 2014, he received a Senior Volunteer Award at Macarthur's 2014 National Volunteer Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few months ago, I visited Vic at Carrington Centennial Care to have a chat and to see how he was going. I fondly remember that sunny morning when I sat there with Vic's daughter, Ruth, and Vic opened up about his life, and this gave me a great insight into a truly remarkable man. It is a day I will never forget.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to Vic's wife, Joan; their four remaining children, Ruth, Max, Kevin and Rex; and their entire family and friends in the community. Rest in peace, Vic. You will always be loved and remembered by your family, friends and community. You were truly a great man.
       </p>
