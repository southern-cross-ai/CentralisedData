         I thank the member for Flynn for his question and note that we were there last week, at Gladstone port—a very deep port, a very industrious harbour. Indeed, we were there announcing $5 million for the Auckland Hill precinct upgrade and $5 million for the hydrogen knowledge hub, and that wouldn't have happened but for the

        <p>
         The member asked me about economic recovery. He asked me what we're doing on infrastructure projects, and there are many. The infrastructure budget today is $110 billion. Just as importantly, that is supporting 100,000 workers. The budget tonight will support an additional 30,000 workers. Shovels in the ground, excavating, building and doing—that's what we want, that's what we're getting and that's what we're delivering. As the Prime Minister has just said, there are more people with a job in Australia today than there were prior to the pandemic, and that is something of which we all should be very proud.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of our new investments being added to the infrastructure pipeline over 10 years include $2 billion for the

           He's a recidivist, Mr Speaker! There is a $2 billion investment to deliver a new Melbourne intermodal terminal in Victoria. There is $400 million more for upgrades to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Bruce Highway
           </a>
           , and, having travelled on it last week, I know those upgrades are going to save lives. There's more investment for Metronet in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , the Truro bypass in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

           and national network highway upgrades in the

           </a>
           . I was near there yesterday. As Zed Seselja and I were there, the motorists were honking at our press conference. I know they were delighted—not just about the upgrades that we're doing in the

           but acknowledging our work right across this wide, brown land.
          </p>
          <p>
           We're getting on with creating jobs, with putting in the investment and with making opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Every state and every territory has benefited and will certainly benefit into the future with the announcements that are going to be made precisely here tonight, at 7.30. I look forward to it. The Treasurer is going to make some more exciting announcements about infrastructure and about regional Australia—because it's been regional Australia that has helped to carry this nation through the pandemic, in agriculture and in resources—to make sure that Australia continues to have those investments and those opportunities into the future.
