       <p>
        I rise to give due praise to the young people of the Fisher and Fairfax electorates who came together recently for a Constitutional convention. The question was, 'Should there be a bill of rights?' At the outset, I should say that I asked for a show of hands and, not surprisingly, the young people overwhelmingly at the start of their convention decided that they wanted a bill of rights. What is so brilliant is that they came with open minds, they also came with inquisitive minds. By the end of the day, they decided that Australia would be better without a bill of rights. They came to that conclusion for two reasons: because of the effect it would have on federalism and states rights, and because of the experience with American gun laws. In particular, John Howard's Aussie gun control laws would not have been possible with an American style system. I thought they were very interesting and very mature observations.

        I particularly want to congratulate the three candidates who will be coming down to Canberra next week for the national convention. They are Adam Cass, from Meridian State College, Josh Henshaw, from Burnside State High School, and Jaymin Pratt, from
