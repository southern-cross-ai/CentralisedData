        I rise to speak on and recognise some of the truly remarkable community organisations in my electorate of Ryan, providing support, friendship and inclusion to local residents with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first organisation, with which I recently met after attending their open day, is eWaste Connection. Established by local constituent Monique Lowndes, eWaste Connection is providing skills, support and friendship to their participants. eWaste Connection partners with the Shed West Men's Shed, local schools and other community groups to dismantle and recycle electronic waste including old computers, televisions or obsolete electrical equipment. By partnering volunteer mentors with individuals with disability, eWaste Connection is assisting people with disability to participate in meaningful work. Through this interaction, individuals gain real world experience in work and developing social skills, while reducing the amount of electronic waste being disposed of as landfill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another wonderful organisation in my electorate is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntyre" rel="nofollow">
         McIntyre
        </a>
        Centre. The McIntyre Centre, located at Bellbowrie, does amazing work in our community by providing weekly therapeutic equestrian sessions for around 200 young people and children with disabilities. Established in 1964, the centre provides a range of activities and support services for these young people and their families and also receives incredible backing from the community. It was estimated that in 2014-15 more than 10,800 hours were contributed by volunteers to the successful running of the centre. With figures like this it is no wonder the McIntyre Centre is always on the lookout for more volunteers to assist in grooming and feeding the horses, lesson assistance and the sorting of donations for McIntyre thrift shops whose profits help fund the therapeutic sessions. The McIntyre Centre is an integral part of our community and draws individuals from all parts of Brisbane. They continue to enhance the lives of these special young people and help them and their families thrive in these programs. Acknowledgement must also go to the countless hours of volunteer support provided by many dedicated locals who simply want to give back to the community and see the smile on someone else's face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was delighted to officially open
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
         HELP
        </a>
        Enterprises' new office at Mitchelton. HELP provides innovative employment and training models to support job seekers with disability. I am very proud to have such an enthusiastic organisation with a dedicated commitment to disability employment services in my electorate of Ryan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, there are some people who would not give the slightest consideration to these organisations and those of similar ilk. But for those with disability fortunate enough to participate, these community organisations are providing hope to what are challenging lives. It is not just about recycling e-waste or riding lessons; it is offering support and inclusion to those in our communities with disability.
