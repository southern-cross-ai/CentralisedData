        Veterans Shed in Glenelg North. The shed is a wonderful haven for veterans and ex-service personnel, where they can go to discuss their concerns, past trauma and welfare issues in a safe environment, whilst also doing really good work for the community. I have had the honour of visiting the shed on a number of occasions and I know that everyone in my community is incredible grateful to Barry and his volunteers for the wonderful work that they do to support veterans in our community.

        Another Local Hero Award went to Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club female boat crew members Diane Donaldson, Katrina Meehan, Stephanie Wyatt, Dayna Blyth and Ken Screen. During a training session three kilometres offshore, this boat crew of volunteer surf lifesavers rescued a fisherman who had fallen out of his moving boat and wasn't wearing a life jacket.

The other citizens of the year were Geoff and Lis Bartlett, who were recognised for their five decades of service to the Blackwood Hills area and community through the Blackwood South Neighbourhood Watch and Blackwood Action Group. I would like to take this opportunity to personally recognise Geoff and Lis for their award. They're very dear friends of mine, they are incredible community volunteers, and I was really, really pleased to see them finally recognised for their tireless work for our local community. The Community Event of the Year went to the Mitcham City Brass band—and, everyone in the community, if you haven't already seen them, please do; they are absolutely brilliant.
       </p>

        All of these honours recipients, whether recognised nationally or locally, are dedicated members of our local community, and I wish to express my sincere gratitude to each and every one of them for their contribution to our community and our broader society through all the wonderful volunteer and professional work that they do.
