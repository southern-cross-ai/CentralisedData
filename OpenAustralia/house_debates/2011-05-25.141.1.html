       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the efforts of a number of residents in the Lindsay electorate. Last week I joined with local business and community leaders at the Lakeside Restaurant at the Penrith Lakes to acknowledge the efforts of the Nepean Youth Accommodation Serviceâ€”its board, management, staff, members, volunteers and sponsors.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYAS" rel="nofollow">
         NYAS
        </a>
        , which began in 1989 as the Penrith Youth Refuge, is a community based not-for-profit organisation that provides accommodation and support to young families and young people in my region who are homeless.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past three decades, NYAS has been making sure that young people can access crisis and transition accommodation services, as well as all of the complementary support that vulnerable young people need. I have long been a supporter of the fantastic work that NYAS does in my community and it was an honour to attend their inaugural members dinner.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the manager of NYAS, Joe Magri, and his dedicated staff and volunteers for the commitment they have brought to the service. I would also like to recognise the chairman, David Keegan, and the dedicated members of the board: Ken Buttrum AM, Carole Kelaher, George Rabie, Michael Rosano, Gary Askwith and Cliff Foley. NYAS works in close partnership with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Mission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to deliver its programs but it also receives a great deal of financial and in-kind support from local businesses and individuals, and it relies on a team of passionate volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The members dinner was also an opportunity to hear from Gerald Dalziel, Melanie Coates, Shane Rollings and Rebecca and Andrew Armodoros. These are some of the young people who have used NYAS services and who have benefited greatly from them. In some cases, they are now in the process of turning their lives around. It was a pleasure to hear their stories and be involved in this important local event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of an outstanding young person in my local community: Miles Stepniewski, who recently received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout Award

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        which was hosted by the Governor and

        </a>
        , Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir. The Queen's Scout Award, the highest award in scouting for venturers, recognises the good character, leadership and community involvement of the Venturer Scout. Recipients of this award must have demonstrated leadership, development, personal growth, community involvement and participation in adventurous activities. It was a great privilege last Sunday to join with other community leaders, Miles's proud family and friends, and members of the scouting fraternity to acknowledge his achievement. Apart from his efforts as a Venturer Scout, Miles has also demonstrated his commitment to the local community through his work with other young people at the Glenmore Park Anglican Church. I congratulate Miles on his achievements. He is a great role model for other young people, and I wish him all the best in the future.
