        I rise to congratulate Berowra Christian Community School on celebrating its 30th anniversary. I had the privilege of attending the school's thanksgiving service on 30 October, when 300 members of the school's community came together to celebrate this milestone. It was wonderful to be part of such a strong and committed community.

        A small K-6 school in a beautiful bushland setting, Berowra Christian school has a strong philosophy of open communication and collaboration in delivering children's education. Based on a solid foundation of pastoral care and responsibility to children, the school's teaching and learning experiences are designed to nurture the unique talents of each child. This approach has been rewarded with outstanding academic results in recent years and happy, involved students who are excited about their school.

        Berowra Christian school is a great example of the Liberal philosophy of providing parental choice in education. The school delivers high-quality education in the Christian tradition, with a nurturing environment that families value. I wish to acknowledge the great work of the Berowra Christian school's Parents and Friends Association, their president, Lys Karagun, and the hard work of Jeni Hayes, who has brought together the 30th anniversary celebrations. I also acknowledge the excellent work and leadership of the school's principal,

        , and former founding principal, Stephen Spies, who retired three years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The enthusiasm, commitment and dedication of families and staff, past and present, is evident and to be commended. I am very much looking forward to visiting the school again in December for their end-of-year presentation and thanksgiving evening. I wish Berowra Christian Community School a very happy 30th birthday.
