        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Today is the 75th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Alamein" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of El Alamein
        </a>
        , and next week we will see the 100th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Beersheba
        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House on what the government is doing to commemorate these two significant events?

         I'd like to thank the member for his question. I know of his deep and abiding interest in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Beersheba
         </a>
         . Today marks the anniversary of the second of three major battles that occurred around El Alamein in Egypt between July and November 1942, where the Australian forces suffered almost 6,000 casualties over a period of five months. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Alamein" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of El Alamein
         </a>
         proved to be the turning point of the war in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          North Africa
         </a>
         , where Rommel and his panzer army were repelled and the Axis forces were subsequently driven from the continent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier today, 23 veterans of the campaign attended a reception in their honour, and later today they will participate in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Last Post

         ceremony at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         . I know the opposition will be represented at that as well. It will be an honour to welcome these veterans to the War Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein. To give you an idea of the mettle of these men, one of my constituents, Max Hammond, was going to come to the War Memorial today, but unfortunately—he's in his mid-90s—he had a heart attack two weeks ago. But he came into my electorate office today and wanted to apologise to the government because he wouldn't be there. Obviously, the message that I gave back was that he didn't need to apologise. It is we—all of us, and every Australian—who need to thank him and all those veterans who served in North Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
         Next week we will also commemorate the centenary of the charge of the Light Horse at the Battle of Beersheba in what now is Israel. It was one of the great cavalry charges. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Light Horse
         </a>
         attacked the enemy lines defending the town of Beersheba. About 800 Australians from the 4th and 12th Light Horse regiments were involved in the charge, suffering 31 deaths and 36 wounded. They captured more than 700 Turkish soldiers and secured a vital water source for Allied troops in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Some members of this parliament will travel to Israel next week to commemorate this significant battle and the service and sacrifice of the Australians who participated. During the Centenary of Anzac period, I ask all Australians to pause and reflect on the service and sacrifice of the Australians and all those who have served. Lest we forget.
