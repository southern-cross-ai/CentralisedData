        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         The Speaker
        </a>
        has received a message from the Senate transmitting a resolution agreed to by the Senate on 25 July 2019 relating to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1)That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p>
        (a) notes:
       </p>
       <p>
        (i) that Mr John Ryan AM, and Ms Barbara Bennett
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        , are recognised for their long and distinguished public service careers,
       </p>
       <p>
        (ii) that however, as key decision makers of public service institutions which will be the subject of investigation and examination during the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, they have significant and unmanageable conflicts of interest which are highly likely to jeopardise the integrity of the Royal Commission,
       </p>
       <p>
        (iii) that over 60 disability organisations have called for the resignation and removal of these two individuals as commissioners for the Royal Commission,
       </p>
       <p>
        (iv) that these organisations have created a set of six criteria to guide the government in the appointment of replacement commissioners,
       </p>
       <p>
        (v) the 1500 individuals who have signed a petition calling for both Mr Ryan and Ms Bennett to step down—many individuals and advocates from the disability community, including former People with Disability Australia President, Mr Craig Wallace, have said they will not give evidence to the Royal Commission should these individuals remain, and
       </p>
       <p>
        (vi) that it is essential that disabled people, their families, and their organisations have confidence in the processes and recommendations of the Royal Commission; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) calls on the Federal Government to immediately remove Mr Ryan and Ms Bennett as Commissioners, and replace them with individuals who meet the positive criteria set out by the disability community.
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) That a message be sent to the House of Representatives seeking its concurrence in this resolution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Copies of the message have been placed on the table for the information of honourable members. I do not propose to read its terms, which will be recorded in the
        <i>
         Votes and Proceedings

        and
        <i>
