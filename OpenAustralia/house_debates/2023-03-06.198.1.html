        Artarmon Public School is a large primary school located in the heart of my electorate. It's community is typical of

        , with many students having at least one parent who was not born in Australia and many others speaking a language other than English at home. In years 5 and 6 alone, there are 440 students whom I recently had the pleasure of meeting when I spent an hour talking to them about all things federal politics. At the end of my time with them, I left them with some homework. I asked them to let me know: if you were me for a day, what would you prioritise? I received thoughtful and articulate responses from over 100 students because, as it turns out, these guys know exactly what to prioritise.

        These young Australians are concerned about climate change and its impact on sea levels, wildlife and the increasing frequency and cost of natural disasters. They are concerned about pollution, plastics in our oceans, waste management and recycling. They are concerned about local infrastructure and getting the right balance between development and housing needs and public green spaces. They are particularly concerned about the plight of refugees and about racism. Given their backgrounds, many of them relate strongly to experiences of others and they are openly perplexed about our country's detention policies and what they say about our sense of humanity.

        I feel heartened to know that students so young are so engaged with their community, and I thank everyone at Artarmon Public School. You are truly among the best of us. and I am proud to speak for you.
