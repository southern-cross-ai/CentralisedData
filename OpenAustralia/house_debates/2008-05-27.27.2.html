        That the Speaker’s ruling be dissented from.

       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I stood before this House to have the call to move a subsequent amendment to call on the Prime Minister to guarantee to this House and to the Australian people that, under the government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuelwatch" rel="nofollow">
         Fuelwatch
        </a>
        , petrol will not go up by more than 1c. Now the government is closing us down and stopping a debate on fuel after it came into this place and moved a motion outlining for the very first time the details of its Fuelwatch proposal. This clearly illustrates—

           The question before the House clearly illustrates that you, Mr Speaker, have failed to take into account that I had the call in the first place so that we could go on to debate this government’s hashed-up proposal for

                I was referring specifically to standing orders, Mr Speaker. In those standing orders there is the opportunity for a member to move a further amendment, as the Prime Minister did in this debate, and there is subsequently an opportunity for further members to move amendments. The Leader of the House and the Prime Minister sought to close us down on fuel. They are trying to close down the Australian people when it comes to petrol prices. We will not be silenced.

                   Mr Speaker, section 87 of the standing orders is about dissent motions. I am moving a motion of dissent from your ruling. Specifically,
                   <i>
                    House of Representatives Practice
                   </i>
                   allows us to engage in a debate and to move an amendment to the debate. Do you know what? We have the hypocrisy of the government in relation to matters of accountability and transparency. What they do is try to close us down. We are defending Australian motorists and the Labor Party are trying to close us down. They are trying to close us down!

                        I have outlined it, Mr Speaker—section 87, dissent from the ruling of a Speaker. Section 87 allows me to argue the point. I have made the point again. What happened was that—and let us be very clear about the procedures that occurred immediately before this dissent motion—firstly, this opposition, the coalition parties, moved a censure motion against the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister scurried away to write up what would be

In the interim, after the first vote about omission had taken place, I came to this dispatch box and I sought the call. You gave me the call. I was moving a further amendment calling on the government to guarantee that under their Fuelwatch plan the price of petrol would not increase as a result of that plan. In the interim you provided the call to the Leader of the House, and under that situation you gave him the call in which he sought to close the debate. We disagree. We are moving a motion of dissent from your ruling. You should have given me the right to outline the motion and debate a motion. That is our view. We want to have a debate on fuel prices and so do 21 million Australians.

                                               , on page 309, outlines the process of how you move an amendment to a proposed amendment. The problem that those members opposite have is that because, when it has been moved to omit words in the main question in order to insert or add others, no amendment to the words proposed to be inserted or added can be moved until the question that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question has been determined. That was determined and then, in accordance with standing order 81 and in accordance with the agreement between the government and the opposition about two speakers each, the debate was closed. Coming up we have, from the member for Cowper, an MPI debate on petrol with three speakers each. There are three more speakers on this item. But what we want to do is vote. We want to vote on FuelWatch because we are for it, and we are not sure whether they are.

It needs to be enforced against the Leader of the House, who is plainly making a political point, not debating the actual motion before the chair.

                                                  A dissent motion is pretty serious. You move it when you think that the Speaker has made an incorrect ruling, when you think standing orders have been breached and when you think House of Representatives practice has been breached. We on this side of the House, when we sat over there, took our obligations seriously in terms of dissent resolutions. There have already been more dissent resolutions this term than there were last term. There have been more dissent resolutions in relation to your rulings this term than last term, and we are only six months into the new government. You have to take—

                                                     </i>

                                                                 </a>

He had not even completed moving the amendment, let alone got to the stage where the Speaker would actually propose the question to the House. The Leader of the House intervened and sought to immediately close it down. I would argue, therefore, Mr Speaker, that he acted prematurely, before he had a right to actually put that motion to the House. He should have listened first to the member for North Sydney moving his amendment and then waited for you, Mr Speaker, to propose the question to the House. That had not happened. He intervened immediately to deny the member for North Sydney the ability to even complete the motion he wanted to bring before the House.

                                                                 It was an important matter. We have been debating the question of FuelWatch. The government had put forward an amendment to our original proposal; that had been approved by the House. Then we were proposing an additional amendment. That was a perfectly normal and correct procedure. But the reading of this additional amendment, proposed by the member for North Sydney, was not even completed. He was going to challenge the government in a really practical way to stand behind their commitment that no-one would pay extra for petrol. This amendment would have put the government to the test about whether they really believed that FuelWatch was going to work or not going to work. But he was not even given a chance to complete moving the amendment. The members of the House are not aware of its contents. Members of the government, who would have had the opportunity to put their votes where their mouths are over recent times, did not even get to hear the amendment. The Leader of the House may not have been aware that some of his members were probably interested in the commitment that this amendment would have enabled, but they were not even given the chance. The amendment had not even been completed by the member for North Sydney, let alone got to the key stage which triggers standing order 81—namely, that the Speaker then puts the question to the House.

The procedures were truncated in a way that denied the member for North Sydney his right to actually put his motion and then for you to put it to the House. So, when the Leader of the House intervened, he was indeed out of order. He was acting ahead of the opportunity that the standing orders provide for the closure of the question.

                                                                 In that regard, Mr Speaker, I believe in this instance your ruling was not correct. Whilst I have every respect and admiration for the way in which you are fulfilling the role, on this occasion there was an error. The opposition is seeking to correct that error and to give all members a fair go and, in this instance, to give the member for North Sydney the opportunity to move his amendment.

That is what occurred. I do not know what part of standing order 81 the opposition do not understand, but again for the benefit of those opposite the standing order says:

Indeed, the member for North Sydney did not raise one substantive argument in defending his position to move a dissent from your ruling. There is a reason why the member for North Sydney did not advance one substantive reason for moving that motion of dissent. It is that there is no reason. This standing order is unequivocal, and every Speaker who preceded you in this place has upheld standing order 81 and the principle that when a procedural motion is moved—in this case by the Leader of the House—the Speaker has no option other than to put that procedural motion before debate continues. That is the only position left to the Speaker, and it is outrageous that the member for North Sydney chose to audition himself for the position of Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. The same goes for the member for Warringah. The two of them were getting up, trying to steal the grab that is going to be on the television news tonight.

You actually accepted that as a procedural motion. You accepted the meaning and the definition of standing order 81. You accepted it not only because it is unequivocal in its wording but also because it has been upheld by Speakers who preceded you as what happens when a procedural motion of this kind is moved in this chamber. The fact is that the member for North Sydney understands that and he chose to move otherwise.
