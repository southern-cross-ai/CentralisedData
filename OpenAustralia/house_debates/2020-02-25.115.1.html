        I rise today to congratulate those in my electorate who were honoured on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year by their appointment to the Order of Australia. These awards and honours highlight that, as Australians, we are all part of something greater than ourselves. I'd particularly like to recognise Professor Bruce Robinson—one of five Australians to be awarded the highest honour, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Companion of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        —for his eminent service to medical research and national health care. Professor Robinson's distinguished career includes his time as the dean of the

         Kolling Institute of Medical Research

        and his current contribution as chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
         National Health
        </a>
        and

         Medical Research Council
        </a>
        and the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce. I thank him for his service to our community, which he continues today as a practising endocrinologist and as a director of various medical research organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Time doesn't permit me to outline the extensive contribution of all the recipients from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        , although I would like to mention two others in more detail. The first is Sister Monica Cavanagh, the congregational leader of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_St_Joseph" rel="nofollow">
         Sisters of St Joseph
        </a>
        , who received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . I know she would see this award as recognition for the work of all the sisters, who today carry forward the work and ethos of their founder,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_MacKillop" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary MacKillop
        </a>
        . They represent the very best of the selflessness and dedication of all who are called to the service of their faith and church. Their leadership in areas like education, supporting the vulnerable and helping Indigenous communities and through their overseas missions is just inspiring. It has been a great pleasure for me to get to know Sister Monica and all those who have followed the path of St Mary of the Cross in North Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to mention
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hackett" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Hackett
        </a>
        , a resident of Artarmon, as his lifework represents the very best of community service. His OAM was awarded for his volunteer work with so many organisations, including the St Vincent de Paul Society, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">

         Wayside Chapel
        </a>
        and the Leichhardt Rowing Club. He has done all these things without the expectation of any recognition because service to others is just something he believes is the right thing to do. It is people like Paul Hackett who make our community so strong. I was pleased to acknowledge his work a few years ago at my own North Sydney community awards, although I suspect the OAM will have a slightly more prominent place on his mantelpiece.
       </p>

        They are joined in my electorate by
