        My constituency question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Could the minister update the House on the government's $1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package, including $25 million for one of Australia's most important tourist attractions, the iconic, the majestic, the awe-inspiring

         I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I am not surprised to hear those opposite cheering the member for Corangamite. She is a very popular local member, and I note her commitment to securing funding for that iconic touring route the

         The Turnbull-Joyce government is focused on delivering a $50 billion infrastructure investment program right across Australia—in our cities, in our major regional centres, in our rural and remote communities. We do that because we recognise that investing in good infrastructure not only can change people's lives but it can save people's lives. Too many people are dying and too many people are being seriously injured on our roads. Tragically, as of today 257 people have died on Victorian roads this year. The total last year was 226. Every death, obviously, is one too many, and that is why we are investing in safer roads right across Australia, in projects like the Great Ocean Road.
        </p>

         I was pleased to be with the Prime Minister last week in Melbourne when we announced a $1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package, and part of that package was $25 million for the Great Ocean Road through our $345 million regional roads package, which will see projects completed right across Victoria. The projects in the member for Corangamite's own seat involve safety measures around the recent landslips and rock-falls which have—

           impacted severely on this most scenic of all coastal routes. The member for Corangamite has been very active in calling for the Victorian government to match that $25 million, and I am very confident that the Victorian government will come on board and yield to her campaign and support us in that regard. I commend the member for Corangamite for her advocacy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I heard the member for Wannon cheering as well, and I want to recognise the work that is going to occur in his electorate on the

           upgrades. There is work also along the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Hamilton Highway
           </a>
           and the

            Geelong Ring Road
           </a>
           . There is planning for the duplication of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Midland Highway
           </a>
           between Geelong and Bannockburn.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, there are projects right across Victoria which are going to be made possible through the Prime Minister's announcement last week. We are getting on with the job of delivering the infrastructure that Victoria needs. This government, under the Victorian $1.5 billion infrastructure package, is also delivering $220 million for the Murray basin freight rail project. The member for Mallee has been a very strong advocate for that project. There is $500 million to go towards the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
            Monash Freeway
           </a>
           upgrade, bringing a total of a billion dollars to go on reducing congestion on that route. The members for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
            La Trobe
           </a>
           , Deakin, Aston and Chisholm have all been strong advocates for improvements to that congested route. There is $350 million for the upgrade of the M80 Ring Road. And, as I mentioned, there is $345 million for rural and regional roads. One of the signature projects will be the $97 million for the Echuca-Moama bridge, for which the new member for Murray has been a very strong advocate.
          </p>
          <p>
           So this is a good deal. It is a good deal for Victorians and it is a good deal for the Victorian government. I am sure they will come on board and match that $1.5 billion.
