       <p>
        Colleagues, it gives me great pleasure today to talk to you about one of the most lovely things about north-east Victoria—the contribution that our migrant communities has made. Today, I would particularly like to acknowledge the Italian community and the work that they have done in the area around Myrtleford.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the enormous pleasure welcoming Italian Ambassador His Excellency Zazo and his wife to Myrtleford a few weeks ago. I would particularly like to thank all the community for gathering as we celebrated

        Colleagues and friends, what I would particularly like to do today is acknowledge one of the leading lights in my community who has such a close relationship to Italy—that is, the Hon.

        . Tim is going to be joining me for dinner tonight with the Italian ambassador. I would like to take this opportunity before the House to thank him for the fantastic job that he has done post being member of the parliament to build relationships between Australia and Italy, and the Vatican, and to keep mentoring young politicians like me to help me do my job. I acknowledge his wife Judy and thank her for her terrific partnership.
