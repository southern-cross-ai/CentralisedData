        This may well be the most important 90-second statement that I make in this place. A recent Morgan poll revealed that most Tasmanians already know that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the best interests of not only Tasmania but also the country. Seventy-four per cent of Tasmanians support this agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        This agreement could not have been written any better for the Tasmanian economy and for Tasmanian workers. As a state that relies on the quality of its produce and its advanced manufacturing production, we know that trade agreements that result in our products getting to market more cheaply will boost the Tasmanian economy and create more jobs. But, like Labor of old, who were always willing to sacrifice the Tasmanian economy on the altar of Greens preferences, it is now trying to whip up a fear frenzy in order to block the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, denying Tasmanians economic opportunity. Tasmanians, though, can see right through this tactic. It is a throwback to Labor's protectionist history of the 1900s. And Tasmanians, I have to say, are far too sophisticated to fall for the weak argument of Labor and the unions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those opposite may take Tasmanians for fools, but we understand the benefits that will flow from this agreement. Whether it is tourists and students or Chinese businesses wanting to invest in our state, it means a growing economy and more jobs. Those opposite need to get behind this China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and give Tasmanians a fair opportunity.

         I also rise to talk about the jobs for Australia agreement—the free trade agreement with China. In my electorate four years ago we exported zero citrus to China; now, one company in my electorate is the biggest exporter of citrus to China in Australia. In the space of four years it has grown from nothing to 10,000 tonnes. The export of table grapes has grown from zero shipping containers to four shipping containers to 334 shipping containers to 1,000 shipping containers. This is translating to jobs for Australians: people who lay out irrigation technology, people who market things, people who pick fruit, people who prune fruit trees and vines, farmers who spend locally—this is a jobs for Australians agreement. And we know that, when you grow the market of 1.3 billion people, and when you can take the products that Australians produce that China wants, Australians benefit. But do not forget: if we do not sign this agreement, this will have dire consequences because

         is fast positioning itself to capitalise on our citrus markets. We sent 10,000 tonnes in 2015, but there is no doubt that, if this agreement does not go through, we may lose that market and there will be many Australians who will not have a job. The Labor Party need to stand behind Australian jobs and sign the free trade agreement and get this legislation through the House.
