        I call on the member for Dobell to join with me in expressing her concern about the cuts that have taken place in this budget, directed towards youths. On the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        there is a very high level of youth unemployment and the actions of this government in cutting the support services to young people, to help them get jobs, is enormous. In this budget we have seen Youth Connections gone, and they provided a vital central service on the Central Coast. They will close on 30 June this year.

        It is interesting hearing the member taking credit for the jobs and skills training centre that was funded under the Labor government—quite a controversial project. It is really interesting to see the member standing up in this House taking credit for something that her side of parliament has absolutely nothing to do with. This budget is going to be really hard on young people. If they lose their jobs they will be there without any income support whatsoever.

          Right—go for it, member of Dobell, because the chair is not going to provide any protection whatsoever to me whilst I speak! Youth Connections on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
           Central Coast
          </a>
          has provided a lot of support for young people, particularly for disadvantaged young people. Add to that the Schools Business Community Partnership Brokers Program, which fosters a whole-of-community approach to support young people as they learn and develop. It is something that the member to Dobell obviously does not support. I would also like to add that this government has ripped money out of the budget by moving away from the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program. Once again, this is something that the member for Dobell obviously does not support.

           <p>
            Obviously you do not, member for Dobell, because you are voting and supporting the money being ripped out of the budget.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Member for Dobell, it is a very extreme thing to remove a member and I certainly do not want to have to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a job seeker experiences difficulty finding employment, this is what the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program was about. They helped with free job preparation, free industry training and connection with employers. Great programs. This government is handing out punishments to unemployed youths. It is not providing any support whatsoever to help them find jobs.
