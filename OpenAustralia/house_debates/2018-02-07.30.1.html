        To many people Dean Ferris is an Australian champion motocross rider who has travelled the world; to us he's a homegrown inspiration, proving that with hard work and dedication you can conquer the world. Dean grew up on a property near Kyogle with his parents, Christina and Peter; his brother, Leeon; and his sister, Veronica. It was on this property that he learned to ride motorbikes from the very young age of four. His love for motorbikes and motocross only grew as he got older and fulfilled his childhood dream of being a professional motocross racer. In 2017 Dean secured his second consecutive Australian motocross championship, where he also made history as the most successful Australian motocross national rider ever, when he won nine out of 10 rounds. He has also won a motocross grand prix, being one of only four Australians ever to do so. He has been all over the world, both representing Australia in the Motocross of Nations and racing for factory teams in Australia,
