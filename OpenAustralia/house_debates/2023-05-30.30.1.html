        Congratulations to Midcoast Hearing from Taree, which was recently named champion of Health Improvement Services at the Australian Small Business Champion Awards, the most prestigious national recognition for Australian small businesses.

        I'd also like to give a great shout-out to Angus Gill, a very talented young Australian country music star who's just completed his Departure and Arrival tour with his final concert in his hometown of Wauchope. Angus has won a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Guitar" rel="nofollow">

        of Pindimar, who was recently crowned the level 9 under-15 Australian champion at the Australian Gymnastics Championships on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        . Josh was sidelined for much of 2022 with a back injury, but he wasted no time in recapturing his form when he returned to training and winning this championship. He also funds his own travelling costs to training and competitions by recycling bottles and cans through the Return and Earn scheme. Well done, Josh, for your determination to succeed against all odds, and all the best for your future.
