       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of launching the inaugural Ryan Community Service Awards. Volunteer organisations and those who work within them are the backbone of the Ryan community. I have been privileged to travel around the electorate and present awards to the outstanding residents who have been nominated by local organisations for their contributions to our community. I sincerely thank these volunteers for their tireless work to make Ryan a better place to live, work and raise a family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I start by acknowledging Mr Andrew Bolton. Andrew has been the main driver behind remodelling the top sports field of St Ignatius School in Toowong, a process to which he dedicated over four years. He has been heavily involved in designing the field, based on the specific needs of the children, and has overseen its construction daily. Andrew is a deserving recipient of a Ryan community award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just down the road from St Ignatius School, Mr Ron Archer has long been involved in the West Toowong Progress Association, helping to establish the West Toowong Bowls Club, a project that he has been leading since the 1950s. Over these decades, Ron has been a driving force in building an outdoor bowling green for the club and overseeing the move from a solely indoor venue to an official competition location for the Royal Queensland Bowls Association. Ron has continually strived to take initiatives to improve the club, whilst maintaining its heritage and uniqueness, a trait which attracts members not only from the local area but from all over Brisbane. The West Toowong Bowls Club would not be the success it is today without Ron’s tireless dedication to the progress association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another deserving recipient is Mr Dennis McKee. Joining the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenslopes_Private_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Greenslopes Private Hospital
        </a>
        team as the volunteer welfare officer in 2008, Dennis has always shown compassion and integrity, continually putting others’ needs above his own. Dennis has never sought recognition for his efforts, and his unassuming and humble nature has endeared him to his peers and veterans, earning him the utmost respect of the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Bill Beeson also falls within this category. For the past three years Bill has voluntarily taught seniors in north-west Brisbane basic computer and internet skills. He teaches eight classes over two days, 48 weeks per year. Bill’s commitment to our seniors is highly respected and appreciated, and I am proud to recognise his dedication and initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Marion Thomas is another example of a selfless individual using her skills to serve the community. Mrs Thomas uses her talent for music to play piano for residents at various aged-care facilities around The Gap, on top of her commitments as an organist for The Gap Uniting Church. Mrs Thomas is an active member of The Gap Amnesty International Group, and helps raise funds and awareness for international care agencies. In the past, she taught literacy programs in the prison system, and she continues this support through her membership of The Gap Uniting Church Mission, Outreach and Community Services leadership team. Mrs Thomas’s unwavering compassion, care and support for those in need is a trait that I truly admire, and I take great pleasure in recognising her efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to collectively recognise the volunteers of the Wesley Breast Clinic. For many years, these volunteers have acted as conduits of communication between the patients and clinical staff. They perform various duties as part of their voluntary work, from the simple comfort of providing tea and coffee to patients to being a supportive ear to any patient or family member in need. In so doing, they create a welcoming and less stressful environment during a difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The calibre of the recipients of this year’s awards was truly outstanding. The nature and skills of volunteers around Ryan are as diverse as the individuals are dedicated, and I offer my continued encouragement and support to community organisations throughout Ryan.
