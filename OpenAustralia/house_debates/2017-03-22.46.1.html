       <p>
        There are many passionate and connected communities in my electorate of Robertson, including the families who live in beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoca_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Avoca Beach
        </a>
        . Earlier this year, members of the Avoca Beach community approached both their federal and state representatives with a petition calling for improved safety at a busy pedestrian crossing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortly after, I was invited via Twitter to join local Avoca Beach residents, including Jodie Skellern,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         Susan Thomas
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Roberts
        </a>
        , Jenny Roberts, Dessa Cook, Natalie Parkes, Assaf Mawad,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Thomas
        </a>
        and Pauline Mawad. Jodie told me that her concerns about the crossing included that often drivers simply do not see the crossing, particularly during the early morning and late afternoon, when the sun shines right through the windscreen into their line of sight.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also heard from dozens of people through my Facebook page, such as Virginia who said she works at Avoca and regularly sees near misses at the pedestrian crossing. Karen agreed it was a dangerous crossing, saying she actually had a near miss as a pedestrian herself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to advise the House that almost 1,000 signatures later, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        is now recommending a number of safety upgrades. The recommended works include zig-zag warning lines on both sides of the crossing to slow traffic on approach, additional signage, the addition of no-stopping zones near the crossing and the repainting of the crossing itself. The council says that the work is set to be completed within a few months.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to recognise Susan and Jodie for their important commitment to this project, as well as each and every resident who signed this petition. I would also like to thank the council and the state member for Terrigalâ€”
