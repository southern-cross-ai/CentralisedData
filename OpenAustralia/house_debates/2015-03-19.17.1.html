         <p>
          The federal opposition is determined to ensure that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe. As well as defending our nation's security, Labor also strongly believes in the importance of upholding the rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation living under the rule of law. That is why the amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 that are being introduced are so important.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill that was introduced into this House on 30 October last year had a number of significant shortcomings. Labor recognised that the bill could not be allowed to pass in the form it was introduced and insisted that the bill be sent to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
          </a>
          with sufficient time for there to be comprehensive scrutiny of the bill and public hearings. As a consequence of the intelligence committee process, 38 significant recommendations for improvements to the bill were made. The government has accepted all of them.
         </p>
         <p>
          I join with the Minister for Communications in thanking all members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, particularly the chair, the member for Wannon, and the deputy chair, the member for Holt, for the joint work that was done, under some time pressure, to produce very significant improvements to the bill. I am sure the member for Blaxland, who with me was added to the committee for the purpose of this inquiry, would endorse those comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Significant recommendations that were madeâ€”all of which are now to be found in the amendments before the Houseâ€”which are directed at better safeguarding the rights and privacy of Australians under the proposed scheme include: specifying the dataset required to be retained in the bill itself, rather than in regulations; limiting access to telecommunications data to enforcement agencies specifically listed in the bill; authorising ASIC and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
           ACCC
          </a>
          to have access to telecommunications data to assist those agencies in the investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime; requiring telecommunications companies to provide customers access to their own telecommunications data upon request; requiring stored data to be encrypted to protect the security and the integrity of personal information; prohibiting access to retained data for the purposes of civil proceedingsâ€”for example, preventing its use in copyright infringement lawsuits; requiring a mandatory data breach notification scheme to ensure telecommunications companies notify consumers if the security of their telecommunications data is breached; increasing the resources of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to strengthen oversight of the mandatory data retention scheme; and, importantly, a mandatory review of the data retention scheme no later than four years from the commencement of the bill.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would say in summary that these amendments are critically important to making this bill what it should beâ€”a bill that will help our law enforcement and security agencies to make Australians safer but without compromising our rights and freedoms that we, as citizens of democracy living under the rule of law, must also defend. I want to reiterate what I said in this House about the context of this bill.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention" rel="nofollow">
           Data retention
          </a>
          is not new. Telecommunications data has been retained for many years in Australia, but it has been occurring in a largely unregulated manner by private companies across Australia. And the data that has been retained by private companies has been accessed under the current legislation, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, by a large number of agencies, hundreds of thousands of times a year. However, while access to this data is often vital to their operations, technological changes and changing business practices of telecommunications providers mean that less data will be retained by some companies in the future. Given this context, Labor has approached this bill and the negotiations over its amendments as an opportunity to regulate and improve the efficacy of data retention for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes while at the same time introducing safeguards that will greatly improve the transparency and accountability of both telecommunications data and access to that data.

           On the government's own admission, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 is a serious bill that alters the balance between government and individuals when it comes to their right to privacy. It also, on the government's own admission, gives new powers for collecting information in a way that it has not been collected before and to an extent that it has not been collected before to effectively be stored now in one place or in several places and then be able to be accessed by a range of organisations. And on the government's own admission it is important that this bill, according to them, passes this parliament. So, given how serious this is, and given that, according to the oppositionâ€”who apparently has done a backroom deal with the government that they are now deigning to let everyone else seeâ€”there are a number of significant concerns with the original bill that needed to be amended, and given in the light of that that we saw for the first time a handful of minutes ago 30 pages of amendments with 74 separate amendments, and given the seriousness of this bill and what it will mean for individuals, what it will mean for people who use their smartphone and the internet without being suspected of having committed any crime whatsoever, then I ask the minister: will he defer and adjourn this debate to allow the parliament enough time to consider 30 pages of 74 amendments that have been seen by other members of this chamber for the first time a handful of minutes ago? Or, will the minister insist that this be rushed through now, without the chance for members of the crossbenchâ€”and who knows who else has seen it within the other partiesâ€”having the opportunity to scrutinise it? Will the minister insist on these amendments being passed right now, even though we have had only a handful of minutes to look at them? I ask the minister: will you adjourn this debate to allow the parliament sufficient time to scrutinise these amendments? The minister may say, 'Well, some of these amendments came out of the PJCIS report, so they shouldn't be news to anyone.' I would say to this that it is up to the parliament, surely, to work out whether what is in here matches what is in that committee's report, and we should have the opportunity to do that. I ask the minister whether he will adjourn the debate to allow us time to do that.

            , which reported in considerable detail on 27 February. The honourable member has had ample opportunityâ€”and I know he has a keen interest in this areaâ€”to read that report and to discuss it with his colleagues in the Greens. It has been the subject of considerable publicity and debate. The amendments we are debating right now are a faithful implementation of a detailed report that has been widely debated and read for weeks, now, and the honourable member really should have no difficulty in dealing with these issues today.

            <p>
             As I said in the second reading debate on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014, this is complex and controversial legislation, and that is why it was appropriate that it be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security for proper consideration and proper investigation. The work the committee did demonstrated that the legislation in its original form is not good enough and that there do need to be substantial changes to it. And we do believe that the recommendations the committee made are faithfully represented in these amendments before the House now and that they substantially change this legislation. We believe that in its original form the legislation gives too much power to the Attorney-General to decide what metadata should be kept and who should have the rights to access it and does not provide sufficient oversight over the use or potential misuse of this legislation. Therefore, we made 38 substantial recommendations in all, which are represented in something like 74 amendments that will be considered by the House now in two tranches.
            </p>
            <p>
             In particular, it is recommended that the definition of metadata, or the dataset, should be in this legislation rather than left to regulation. That provides real certainty for telcos about what they should keep and what they do not have to keep. It is also recommended that it should be the parliament that decides which agencies should have the right to access this metadata, and that it not be left to governmentâ€”to the Attorney-Generalâ€”to decide by regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is recommended that the data itself should be encrypted to provide a higher level of security.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is recommended that people should have the right to access their own data. This has been unclear in the past. It will be clear now because of this amendment. Once again, I just want to recognise that Telstra quite recently announced that it would do this, as of 1 April.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is recommended that we establish, for the first time, a data breach notification system, so that if your data is hacked into you will be notified of it. The former Attorney-General, my friend
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
              Mark Dreyfus
             </a>
             , introduced legislation to do this in the last parliament. On the prorogation of parliament, that lapsed. Now, because of this recommendation and the government's agreement to implement it, that will happen as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Extra resources are recommended for the Ombudsman. Oversight here is critical. If you give law enforcement agencies more power it is important that you also equally increase the oversight of those powers. The Ombudsman said that they are very able to do this work, but they need additional resourcesâ€”about 12 additional staff, which will require about $2 million in the first year and about $1.65 million thereafter. We recommended that that occur, and the government has agreed to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also recommended that for the first time the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security should have the same sorts of powers that its equivalents in the United States and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             haveâ€”the power to conduct investigations into the operations of national security agencies in respect of this legislation. This will now be possible for the first time. It is an important first step in the implementation of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Faulkner" rel="nofollow">
              John Faulkner
             </a>
             reforms. His proposition, introduced into the Senate, was that this committee should have those powers with respect to national security agencies generally. We think that is an important reform, which we will continue to press for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, there is the issue of costs. This is important because this is not an inexpensive scheme. This is expensive. The PwC work shows a wide arc of potential cost between about $180 million and over $300 million. That work focuses on capex; we do not have specific details yet on opex. In the committee's work, we made the point that it is very important that, in the funding model that is developed, the government has special consideration for small
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">
              ISP
             </a>
             sâ€”sometimes very small businesses that might have less capacity to implement this scheme than your Telstras of the world, or Optus or Vodafone. Quite legitimately, the Australian telco industry, represented by Communications Alliance, wrote a letter recently to the minister and to the Attorney-General asking that the government provide industry, the parliament and the wider community with a degree of certainty as to the size of the government's planned contribution and the planned methodology for apportioning those funds between
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSP" rel="nofollow">
              CSP
             </a>
             s of differing types and market shares. I think this is a valid point. Industry will bear a significant proportion of this cost. The minister has indicated that the government will bear a substantial proportion of the cost, but a significant proportion will still be borne by industryâ€”big and small. I seek the assistance of the minister in providing more information in this regard.

             </small>
             <p>
              I expressed a number of concerns yesterday in the substantive debate. I have no interest in traversing ground already travelled on. On the issue of cost, the minister is well aware of the concerns I expressed yesterday, and I re-express them today. They have also been given voice by the shadow minister. There are a number of things in relation to this. As the shadow minister for communications, the member for Blaxland, just indicated, the type of system changes that will be required by this legislation are significant. This will require a great investment, particularly when you consider the smaller providers. They do not necessarily have the resources of larger players to be able to accommodate these requests.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, some of the amendments that have been put forward in the processâ€”that have rightly been reflected on in in a very positive wayâ€”will require a greater degree of encryption, and that will require different standards. Some of the smaller players do not necessarily adhere to those standards, and they are rightly concerned.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have also had expressed to me in the last few weeks a concern from smaller players. They say to me, 'The Attorney-General's Department believe that consultation with Telstra and Optus should represent all that is required when it comes to talking to the telecommunications sector.' The Attorney-General's Department may rightly point out that there is an industry working group and a lot of views are canvassed by that. I understand and appreciate their point, but it would be remiss, at this point in time, to ignore the argument that has been put forward by smaller players that says: 'Telecommunications consultation should not just be limited to Telstra and Optus. The smaller players should be taken into account.'
             </p>
             <p>
              They feel that, in the course of this legislation being considered, their views are not being taken into account. That is a serious concern. If these costs do impact on them in such a way that it puts serious pressure on their operating future, that is of great concern, because they are providing the type of things that consumers wantâ€”competition and pressure on some of the big players to provide better service because of the existence of competition. I am very concerned that those smaller players will face an uncertain future as a result of the inability or the unwillingness of the government to actually spell out what will be done in terms of covering the up-front costs, the capex, and the ongoing running costs, the opex.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know the minister is very alive to these issues, but I have to say the fact that there has not been greater certainty in terms of what costs might be covered is of concern. I also appreciate that the minister has only just got the PwC report, which I understandâ€”and he can correct me if I am wrongâ€”has not been widely discussed with the sector. It may be the case that it has and I am not aware of it, but I am told that that report has not been discussed in detail with the sector and there has not been a walk through. That is of concern. That certainly needs to be addressed.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do appreciate that the government is trying to work out, based on the PwC work and the consultations with the IWG, where they will land on this. I would certainly urge that there be greater certainty. I know this matter will be debated in the other place, and it would be beneficial if the government were able to spell out where its thinking is on that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would also hopeâ€”and this was expressed by the shadow ministerâ€”that greater support can be provided for the smaller players to accommodate these changes. It may be the case that Telstra and Optus are in such a strong position with their systems that they can accommodate the transition relatively easily. But certainly I would hope that greater support is extended to those smaller players in meeting the capex, the up-front cost of establishment, and that there is some sort of signal given for opex as well. Overall, again, I know that the minister is alive to these issues, but I am concerned that we have had no signal given. The government made some big expenditure decisions yesterday on other matters that totalled $300 million, yet on this matter there has been no signal given as to what will be done to help those smaller players. I urge the government to give that signal and provide greater certainty to the sector.

              <p>
               I will respond very briefly to the member for Chifley. This matter of costs is dealt with in recommendation 16 of the joint committee. The government is committed to paying a substantial portion of the capex, the implementation costs, for this data retention scheme. I made that very clear in the second reading speech. We will take into account each of the seven factors identified by the committee. They include, firstly, providing sufficient support for smaller service providers that do not have the same massive capital budgets that Telstra or Optus do, for example. Obviously operating costs once the system is set up will be reimbursed on a cost recovery basis, as is currently the case.

                   <p>
                    Thank you. We just heard from various speakers, including speakers leading the charge from the opposition, that this is complex legislation and that the amendments that are being debated here came out of significant and lengthy examination by some people in this parliament of what is already a complex piece of legislation. Presumably the amendments are similarly complex. Despite that, we are being asked to vote on dozens of amendments on complex legislation, having seen them all for a matter of minutes and without the opportunity to even read them. You could not have even read through this sheet of amendments in the time since it was circulated let alone digested the amendments or formed a view about whether they adequately reflect the concerns coming out of PJCIS.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If this is something that, as the minister says, has been canvassed over several weeks on topics out there in the public realm that could have been discussed then these amendments could have been too. These amendments could likewise have been circulated with sufficient time in advance if that is how long they have been on the table and known. Why have they been kept under wraps until now? The minister and the opposition are essentially saying to us: '
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
                     Tony Abbott
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
                     Bill Shorten
                    </a>
                    have done a handshake deal. Just trust us that these amendments do what we say they do.' On an issue as serious as giving security agencies additional rights and powers over people's smartphones and internet records, they are saying, 'Just trust us, because we did a deal last night. Even though we have been talking about this for weeks and even though the report has been out for weeks, we would not deign to circulate these amendments to you so that you could form a view on them. Just trust us.'
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That is not the way a parliament should be run at any time. It is especially not the way a parliament should be run of when it comes to serious questions like these that everyone has admitted are serious. But it seems that the government and the opposition want to shotgun this through this place without any opportunity to consider these amendments. Our objection to that is strongly noted. If they want to do that, it says a lot about what they consider is the role of this place and what they think of the public, because the public have not had a chance to digest these amendments but their representatives are being asked to vote on them after a handful of minutes to consider themâ€”not even enough time to read them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Perhaps I can ask the minister for some detail about something that we do know about. Something that has been raised during the course of the debate is the question of civil suits. That was raised by the PJCIS as well. It has been said by some that this new regime will not give any information that will allow someone to be prosecuted for downloading
                    <i>
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones" rel="nofollow">
                      Game of Thrones
                     </a>
                    </i>
                    . Let's assume that that is right. Given the limited time to go through all of this, who knows whether that is true. You have Tony Abbott saying, 'Trust me.' Given as Labor reminds us continuously that you cannot trust the Prime Minister to say one thing before an election and then mean it afterwards and you cannot trust the Prime Minister's budget, why on earth would anyone trust him on this? Labor is prepared to, but we are not.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Let's just focus on this question of someone who downloads
                    <i>
                     Game of Thrones
                    </i>
                    . The minister tells us that such a person will not be prosecuted. What if a media company or someone else wants to sue that person? What if they want to sue someone for downloading something? Or what if they want to sue them about something completely different? What if it is not related to that? What if it is a suit between a company and an individual or a company and another company? Given that there will now be a massive honey pot of information that is going to be kept, can the minister tell us whether in these amendments or in the legislation there is rock-solid, shieldlike protection against anyone ever having this data disclosed in the process of a civil suit?

                     . The effect is that service providers are no longer permitted to disclose telecommunications data either in response to a subpoena, a notice of disclosure or a court order or as a witness in civil proceedings where the data has been kept solely for the purpose of complying with the proposed new part 5-1Aâ€”that is, the new data retention regimeâ€”and the data is used or disclosed by the service provider only for that purpose; for a limited range of defined public interest purposes, such as to prevent a threat to life or to assist the telecommunications industry ombudsman in the consideration of a complaint; or for a purpose incidental to one or more of those purposes.

                     address records resolved to the account holders' names, and that is done for a whole variety of civil suit reasons. All of that is available now and there is no limitation on it whatsoever. So, in fact, the bill and the amendments that we are talking about now, which flowed from the committee's work, actually restricts the access of civil litigants to information of this kind.

                       I thank the honourable member for his inquiry. There is no requirement in the bill or the amendments that the data be stored inside Australia, although that is obviously a matter of some controversy that is, as I understand it, going to be considered further by the committee. It may well be the subject of an amendment in the Senate. Of course, the honourable member is talking about the lack of consideration of these amendments, but there is another place in which his party is quite amply represented, so there is plenty of scope for this legislation and his party's concerns to be dealt with. So, yes, there is no provision that requires the server hosting that data to be physically located in Australia.

                        On the last point that was raised by the member for Melbourne, the issue of where data stored under this mandatory data retention scheme is actually physically stored is a concern to Labor. It is something we raised in the course of the deliberations of the committee, it is something that has been raised publicly by a range of interested parties and, indeed, it is something that was commented on publicly by the former Director-General of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                        </a>
                        , a very eminent Director-General of ASIO,

                         David Irvine
                        </a>
                        , just in the last few days, with David Irvine expressing his own view that it was appropriate for data that is stored under this scheme to be stored in Australia. I think he described himself as a 'cyber nationalist', but certainly expressing the view that it was not appropriate that the storage of data be governed by some other country's sovereign legislation but not be governed by our own. It is something that was not appropriately able to be dealt with directly in this legislation that is before the House, because there has been, under a process commenced by Labor in government, a process called the telecommunications sector security reform, which will come to a conclusion. In his second reading speech, at the commencement of parliamentary consideration of this bill, the Minister for Communications noted that that process was coming to a conclusion and is likely to be completed before the end of the implementation phase of this data retention scheme. Labor's view is that this is an important matter, but that it is something that is more appropriately dealt with as part of the larger reform known as the telecommunications sector security reform. That was a reform investigated, commented on and recommended on by the intelligence committee in its report in 2013. It will cover a much wider range of matters concerned with telecommunications sector security than simply the question of storage of retained data. Nevertheless, that telecommunications sector security reform process is the right place to deal with this legislation, and following on from that is the right place to deal with the question of location of storage. Labor intends to keep a very close eye on that process and, when that matter comes before the parliament, we will certainly be insisting on onshore storage of data retained under this scheme.

                         There you have it. You ask a couple of questions about amendments that you are given with a couple of minutes notice and it turns out that one of the issues raised by the PJCIS about location of data is not, in fact, dealt with in these amendments. The very serious question about whether all of this information that is collected is going to be stored in Australia under Australian laws or whether it is going to be stored somewhere else is not even dealt with. We have just been asked, not a few minutes ago, to be assured by the minister and the opposition representatives that everything that has been dealt with is covered in these amendments. I ask a couple of questions and it turns out that it is not. And who knows what else we would find out if we went through every one of these line by line. But we are not given the opportunity to do that because we are asked to vote on it straight away. But the very simple and serious question that people have been on notice about for a while, 'Where is this going to be stored and what are the protocols around it to ensure that it is stored safely?' is not even dealt with in here, despite us being assured a moment again that it will all be okay. And that is exactly why we are not willing, and nor should the parliament be willing, just to be a rubber stamp for a back-room deal that has been done, because who knows what else is in here.

                           Another question, and it turns out there is not even anything in this legislation or these amendments to ensure that the data gets destroyed. Who knows where it is going to be kept and who knows how long they are going to keep it? There is nothing to say it is going to be destroyed. We are being asked to take this on faith and on face value with a few minutes' notice and to rush it through the parliament. What an appalling way to conduct such a significant piece of legislation! I ask, in another vein, when it comes to legal professional privilege, what protections will there be to ensure that a government agency does not get access to emails, or the content of emails or metadata that may be subject to legal professional privilege?

                            The answer to that very simply is that the metadata dataset does not include the content of emails, so the honourable member is labouring under a misapprehension on that point. It is an issue that does not arise.

                             It follows from that that if you contact a lawyer to seek information, the metadata that signals that you have contacted your lawyer to seek advice is presumably metadata that is going to be caught and the government gets access to that. The government will know you have sought legal advice about something or have spoken to a lawyer. Is that how this legislation operates?

                              The honourable member should be aware that the fact that you have had communications with a lawyer is not subject to legal professional privilege. The advice is what in most circumstances is subject to legal professional privilege. The fact that you have telephoned your lawyer at a certain time or a number that is in fact belonging to your lawyer is information that is held by telcos now. It can be accessed now. But the content of the telephone call or indeed the content of an email is expressly not coveredâ€”it is not retained by the telco at all and it is expressly not covered by this legislation.

                               It is apparent from a few moments' questioning that this set of amendments does not automatically implement every recommendation of the PJCIS or address the concerns that have been raised. We find out within a couple of questions that there are no restrictions on where the data is kept or impositions around the destruction of that beyond what the minister has just added. We are not prepared to take all of this on face value. The short period of time we have had to digest this limits any prospect for sensible debate in this place. I repeat the request that, given that we have just found out about the issue of data storage and destruction, for example, the minister reconsider pushing this legislation through this afternoon and give us further time to digest the amendments so that we can find out what else is in there and whether, in fact, the legislation gives effect to the recommendations.

                                I would say in respect of the remarks that have been made by the member for Melbourne that this set of amendments directly and faithfully gives effect to the 38 substantive recommendations made by the intelligence committee. One of the concerns that I have had throughout the debate about this proposed data retention scheme is the number of misconceptions and myths that have been put about about both the legislation and what might be involved, even after a lengthy report of the intelligence committee was delivered on 27 February.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The member for Melbourne and anyone else anywhere in Australia who is interested in this topic has had almost three weeks to read that very lengthy report of the intelligence committee. I am assuming that it is not intentional, but the comments of the member for Melbourne might have left the impression in respect of the two topics that he has chosen to ask questions aboutâ€”restrictions on where the data is to be kept and the destruction of retained dataâ€”that in some way the amendments that have been brought before the House do not give effect to recommendations of the intelligence committee. The fact of the matter is that the intelligence committee did not make a recommendation in respect of restricting where the data be kept. It did in the body of the report discuss the issues raised, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Those issues are a real concern expressed by members and expressed publicly by this side of the House, by Labor, that retained data should be stored in Australia. Certainly, the intelligence committee accepted that there is an ongoing process called the telecommunications sector security reform, which is going to deal with not only that question of where retained data should be kept but a whole range of other questions to do with telecommunications sector security.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                On the question of the destruction of retained data, there is detailed consideration in the intelligence committee's report of the existing provisions of the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
                                 Privacy Act

                                which have been part of Australian law for many years that require private companies that are keeping personal information of Australians to keep that information for no longer than they require it for the business purpose for which they have collected it, and the same obligation applies to governmentâ€”that government is not to keep personal information of Australians for longer than it is needed for the purpose for which it was collectedâ€”and at the end of that period it is to be destroyed or all personal identifiers removed from it.

                                I make those points because I would not want it thought that, in respect of either of the matters that the member for Melbourne has chosen to ask questions about, the government's amendments have not dealt in any way with the recommendations in the committee's report. Indeed, both those matters are going to be dealt with and kept very much under review and carefully attended to by Labor. Thank you.

I commend these amendments to the House.

                                    The warrants will be issued by an independent issuing authority which, in the case of the enforcement agenciesâ€”typically the policeâ€”will be a judge, a magistrate or a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and, in the case of ASIO, will be the relevant minister, the Attorney-General. That independent issuing authority must be satisfied that the public interest in the issuing of the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source. These tests recognise that journalists have a duty to protect their sources' identities and should take care to do so, but the legal protections that flow from that duty are not absolute. The protection can be overruled if other public interests outweigh the public interest in protecting a source's identity.

                                    In relation to metadata specifically, journalist's privilege has never prohibited the police from investigating criminal offences committed by a journalist or their source, by using investigative methods that do not involve direct compulsion of the journalist themselves.

                                      A critical matter of concern to Labor was the potential for the bill, in the form in which it was introduced by the Abbott government, to stifle freedom of the press. A number of working journalists and their organisations have expressed legitimate concerns that the data retention scheme as proposed by the government would compromise the anonymity of journalists' sources. Labor have been clear that we share the concerns expressed by journalists. The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister, making clear that Labor believe that the relationship between journalists and their sources should be protected by warrant and that this important matter needed to be progressed.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Although the Attorney-General suggested several times this week that the concerns of the journalists were misguided, at one stage describing those concerns as 'a red herring', the government has agreed to Labor's demand to put in place a warrant system to protect journalists' sources. Labor has been working to negotiate a warrant scheme to protect freedom of the press, and I am pleased that the scheme has now been agreed and is the subject of this group of amendments before the House.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The key aspects of the framework to protect journalists' sources are as follows. Agencies seeking access to retained data will be prohibited from accessing telecommunications data to identify a journalist's source unless that agency obtains a journalist information warrant. There will be a statutory presumption against issuing a journalist information warrant. Agencies must establish that the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist's source, having regard to matters including the extent to which the personal privacy of individuals would be interfered with, the gravity of the matter in relation to which the warrant is being sought, the extent to which the information being sought would assist the agency seeking it to perform its functions, whether the agency has made reasonable attempts to obtain the information sought by other means, and any submissions made by the public interest advocate.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      This last point is of particular importance and I will say a little bit about the public interest advocate, because the public interest advocate will play a critically important role in the protection of journalists' sources. The public interest advocate will speak for the matters of public interest that are to be taken into account in any decision as to whether or not to issue a journalist information warrant. The amendments provide that the Prime Minister 'shall' appoint a public interest advocate. For the avoidance of any doubt, the government has committed to appoint a public interest advocate, because that advocate, as I have said, central to the operation of the warrant system to protect freedom of the press in the context of the data retention scheme. I must say that I am a little puzzled about the government's choice of the word 'shall', given that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel's

                                      </i>
                                      says that 'must' should be used in preference to 'shall' because 'shall' is ambiguous. If there is any doubt created by using the word 'shall', let me remove it by saying that this legislation will oblige the Prime Minister to appoint one or more public interest advocates.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The public interest advocate is to be notified whenever an application for a journalist protection warrant is made. The public interest advocate is charged with responsibility to, in effect, stand in the shoes of the journalist and argue the public interest issues relevant to preserving the confidentiality of a journalist's sources in relation to a particular warrant application. Labor expects that the public interest advocate will be a very senior lawyer or lawyers appointed within the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio, similar to the existing arrangements for the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. If a warrant is issued, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Ombudsmanâ€”depending on which agency has obtained the warrantâ€”and the

                                      must be notified as soon as practicable. The intelligence committee will be empowered to order the IGIS or the Ombudsman to provide a briefing on the issuing of the warrant. I commend this scheme for journalist information warrants, which will provide protection in respect of journalists' sources and thus provide some protection for freedom of the press, to the House.

                                       These are important amendments which have resulted after a lot of hard work after a lot of disagreement. As the member for Isaacs said, this is an area where the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security could not agree. Labor members argued that a warrant was necessary for law enforcement and security agencies to get access to a journalist's metadata for the purposes of identifying their source. Liberal members did not agree. We believe that it is important that a warrant should be required, because we believe that journalists are special, that journalists are different.

                                       As I said in the second reading debate, the privacy of journalists' sources is integral of the freedom of the press. It is why shield laws exist for journalists. It is important, because sometimes it is journalists who are investigating law enforcement. To this point, the United Kingdom recently passed legislation enacting a code of practice, which will come into effect before their election, to create a warrant based process before law enforcement can get access to a journalist's metadata for the purposes of identifying their sourceâ€”and they have done it for good reason. Work that has been conducted in the United Kingdom has identified where law enforcement access to journalist metadata has been misused and has identified that this is a necessary check.

                                       We accept that journalists are a special case because, for example, in investigating a leak, determining who spoke to whom may be more important than what was said, but the same argument does not apply to other sensitive professions.

                                       Thankfully, finally, the Prime Minister backed down on this on Monday. He did that after a letter from the Leader of the Opposition on the weekend that said, 'We will listen very carefully to the evidence that is to be given tomorrow at a hearing of the committee by the chief executive officers of

                                       As I said on Tuesday morning, we also believe that this warrant must not be just a tick and flick. After a lot of hard work, we have got amendments in this legislation which I believe now meet that test. I draw the House's attention to two key elements of this warrant process. The first is the establishment, for the first time, of a public interest advocate, and the second is a standard that the judge will need to be satisfied of before they can grant a warrant. In respect of the first, the establishment of a public interest advocate, as the minister and the shadow Attorney-General have said, this creates an independent voice in the court acting for the public interest, and it is a critical part of making sure that this is not a tick-and-flick approach. It is based on the public interest monitor system that exists in Queensland and Victoria. It has existed for 20 years in Queensland with respect to listening device warrants and for five years in Queensland with respect to phone taps. It would be a senior barrister in private practice that would fulfil this role.

                                      <p class="italic">
                                       (b) the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the source in connection with whom authorisations would be made under the authority of the warrant â€¦
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       This is the key test that the judge needs to be satisfied of and provides an assurance that this is not a tick-and-flick warrant process.

                                       <p>
                                        I have a comment and a question for the minister. I am the first to agree that journalists should have some level of protection. They should have some certainty that they can keep their sources confidential, particularly when it comes to national security articles they might be working on. In fact, the minister would remember that, early in the 43rd Parliament, I progressed successfully the so-called shield laws to give journalists greater protection as far as ensuring that they could keep their sources confidential.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        The issue here is not so much that journalists need extra protection; the issue is why don't other people have greater protection? For example, why would we say that it is important for a journalist to keep private the name of a source, but yet it is not important for a lawyer for instanceâ€”or perhaps a judge or a medical professionalâ€”to keep private the fact that he or she had a communication with someone? Some in this place would even argue that a priest should be able to reliably keep confidential the names of the people that they might deal with. What about members of parliament, who might be approached by someone in the community on a very, very sensitive matter? That member of the community would feel that their identity must be reliably kept confidential.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        The point is that there are lots of people in the community who have an equally legitimate need to have their identity kept secret in certain circumstances, for very good reasons and for reasons equally as good as a journalist. In fact, in my personal opinion, I think warrants should be required for the security services to access metadata in any case, for any person. We know that already the security services are accessing metadata hundreds of thousands of times. Every time they access metadata, they are effectively searching someone's private property. We accept in the community that, when it comes to the search of private property, it is entirely proper that the security services should get a warrant if they are going to go into someone's house or search someone's property. So why is this different?
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        As I made perfectly clear in my speech to this bill in this place yesterday: this is a missed opportunity. It is a missed opportunity to examine the need to give protection to all members of the community. I can see no good reason why this bill should not require warrants for any access of metadata, for any purpose, for any person. Yes, that would slow things up. I accept that that would make it more difficult for the security services. But the point that I made yesterday, and I make it again, is that because it would be a bit more difficult, because there would be a bit more of a tension in the process, the security services would be reluctant to just ask for information at the drop of a hat. The number of times that metadata is accessed would fall dramatically because the security services would find it, frankly, an embuggerance. They would focus just on the people that they really need to focus on, and they would not be accessing metadata on a whim, which I have no doubt occurs at the moment. Because at the moment and if this bill becomes law, for everyone except journalists, it will be just so easy for any security service officer to pick up the phone, ring up Telstra, Optus, Vodafone or whoever, and ask, 'What have you got on Harry Bloggs?' There will be next to nothing to put any sort of impediment in the way of that going on.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        By the way, I do not accept the minister's answer that there is no, and should be no, protection or confidentiality when a lawyer speaks to a client or someone who might be a client, but that is not the point here. The point here is that we accept that journalists should be able to keep private that they are in contact with someone, surely that should be extended to lawyers. My question to the minister is: what is so special about journalists that only they get protection, not lawyers, not doctors, not members of parliament, and not priests perhaps, as would be view of some people? Why can't we all have protection?

                                         , who was answering this very same question, as the member for Blaxland referred to earlier, and who made the point:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         We accept that journalists are a special case because, for example, in investigating a leak, determining who spoke to whom may be more important than what was said, but the same argument does not apply to other sensitive professions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The important point there is that the privilege that attaches to lawyers' advice, or the privilege that attaches to a priest's discussion with someone who is making their confession, attaches to the content, and the content is not dealt with here. We are literally only talking about the metadata, whichâ€”relevantly, in the circumstances we are talking about nowâ€”would indicate that telephone A called telephone number B at a particular time. There is no privilege attaching to that at all. There never has been.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         This issue is that journalists have a special role in terms of their need to protect their communications with informants, otherwise they cannot do their work. I can say more about the extraordinary qualifications and virtues of journalists but, given my previous occupation, that might be seen as self-serving.

That could be every bit as important, and just as relevant, as the case of a journalist. Let's say someone rings me up or rings you up and reports wrongdoing. You or I would stand up in the chamber on the next sitting day and take the opportunity that this place provides to ventilate those concerns. Shouldn't that source be protected in the same way as journalists' sources would be given protection?

                                           If there were an investigation of a crime that required examination of metadata that might include telephone records between a member of parliament or somebody else, that information is available now and is being accessed now. The rationale the member is advancing in that example would basically mean that the whole system of access to metadata would grind to a halt. We have special protections in this bill for journalists, given their special role.

                                           I do not want to overdo the lavish praise for journalists and journalism but we cannot get away from the fact that the work journalists do is as important as anything the honourable member and I doâ€”or any of our colleagues do. It is absolutely critical in their ability to access information confidentially and to protect their sources. I repeat that it is the journalist's job to protect his or her sources and they should take every care to do so; and their employer should ensure that they take care to do so.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           There is a vital public interest in ensuring that we have a free and robust press. We all feel the lash, from time to time, and we all feel we have been mistreated and misunderstood, but we will not have a democracy without a free and fearless and independent press. So it is very important to recognise that journalists sit in a different situation.

                                            I am sorry, Minister, that I am labouring this point. An observer might think it a bit self-indulgent that members of parliament are talking about the need for greater protection for members of parliament, but I am only using the example of you and meâ€”or someone in this placeâ€”because I think it is a very helpful way of understanding a flaw in the bill.

                                            The amendment acceptsâ€”and I agreeâ€”that journalists have a very important role to publicise wrongdoing. I agree with you. It is legitimate that journalists should have protection. But in what the government is trying to achieve here, with the support of the opposition, the logic is breaking down somewhere. If we agree that journalists should have protection so that they can effectively publicise wrongdoing, then surely my standing up here and ventilating a concern expressed to me privately by a constituent about, say, misconduct in a Public Service department, is equally important. And that source of information surely should have the same protection as the source who might go to a journalist instead.

The chances are that someone, somewhere is going to ask who made a call from a DVA number to my number today. I am sure you can see what I am getting at. It is an example. Why shouldn't the source of information in DVAâ€”in that exampleâ€”have just as much protection as someone who might have gone to a journalist?

                                             The honourable member poses a good question. He poses it in good faith, as we all accept, but you have to draw the line somewhere. We have drawn the line with respect to journalists because they are in a very special category. The job of journalists is finding and publishing information that people do not want to have published. I think that one great newspaper man at some time said that the definition of news was something that people in power do not want the public to read. So that is a very special situation that journalists are in.

                                            <p>
                                             The point the honourable member is making is a perfectly reasonable question to ask.
                                            </p>

                                             The government has chosen to deal with journalists in this very specific way. No doubt this debate will continue, but it is very important that this legislation be passed. We really do need to get on with it. This issue has been knocking around for some years now without resolution, and the government is committed to getting this legislation passed. The police and

                                             are very anxious that it be passed, but it will still be debated, of courseâ€”assuming it is passed in this House todayâ€”in the other place as well. But I thank the honourable member for his very thoughtful question nonetheless, and I hope he finds my answers at least somewhat satisfying.

                                              Following on in part from the answer just given, whatever may be said about the first set of amendmentsâ€”given that they arose, we are asked to understand, out of the PJCIS and that that had been ventilated for some timeâ€”the same cannot be said about this second set of amendments. It may be that, if we have the opportunity to understand these amendments, they are worthy of support because they make a bad bill slightly less awful than it currently is. But, given that we have just been given 15 or 16 pages worth of amendments that we are told are designed to offer some protection to journalists, I ask the minister again: in respect of these, given that this was not an agreed outcome of PJCIS and was not, as the minister has urged us to accept with respect to the first set of amendments, something that has been out there in the public domain for a long period of time, surely we should have the opportunity now to go and test these amendments with journalists, with people who represent journalists and with free speech advocates before all of us sitting in this parliament are asked to vote on them. That surely should be an uncontroversial proposition: that we now have time to go and consider these amendments which have just come out of the blue today. I ask the minister to please adjourn this debate so that we can go and seek advice about whether these amendments give journalists the kind of satisfaction that they are seeking.

As I said earlier, it is very important that we get on with this legislation and get it passed. It will, of course, be subject to debate and consideration in the other place, the Senate. As far as this particular set of amendments is concerned, these are straightforward and very readily comprehensible. The honourable member, famous for his quick and agile intellect, has had no problem in understanding them. The structure is very clear.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               I would think there is only one real issue of contention with the media sector, which I have spoken to and which we have consulted with intensely. I want to thank journalists againâ€”for example,
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Oakes" rel="nofollow">
                                                Laurie Oakes
                                               </a>
                                               , the elder statesman of the press gallery, has been very eloquent on this matterâ€”and, of course, their union and the employers themselves and the editors. I thank them all for their contribution. Many of them made an argument that, before a warrant of this kind was issued, the journalist should be given prior notice so that the journalist could appear, either personally or with counsel, to oppose the issuing of a warrant. That would be a massive, radical change to the way in which warrants are issued and would have implications and create a precedent that would go well beyond this case, so neither the government nor the opposition supported that. But, apart from that, I think this provides answers to the concerns of the media organisations and, based on my discussions with them today, they have broadly welcomed it.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               So I really do put to the honourable member that he has more than adequate time to deal with this. We often have to deal with things quickly in this House. Sometimes people think the wheels of government grind very slowly, but on occasions we have to crank it up and get things done. We are here to legislate, not just go round in circles on issues, and we have been going round. I make no criticism of anybody, but this issue has been kicking around for years, and we are bringing it to a resolution now. It is a great credit to the Prime Minister for his energy in making sure that this matter is brought to resolution, and I also pay credit to the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues the member for Isaacs and the member for Blaxland for their cooperation with us this week in getting these amendments resolved.

                                                I thank the minister for his flattery but, with respect, we have 30 pages of amendments, and we have been on our feet and in this chamber debating the first 15 pages, so the suggestion that during that time we have had enough time to read, consider and form a view on the last 15 pages is just fanciful, and I suspect the minister knows that. Given that we are doing this on the fly, with no time to seek advice or consider it, let me ask the minister a couple of questions about how this is intended to operate. I see in proposed section 180L that there is reference to the minister issuing a warrant with respect to the journalist. I am wondering if the minister can explain who that minister is and what the minister's role in respect of issuing warrants is under these amendments.

                                                 I thank the honourable member for his question. The minister, as I am sure the honourable member is aware, is the minister responsible for the organisation, which is

                                                 , and that is the Attorney-General. Under the existing law, the minister is responsible for giving warrants to ASIO when ASIO seeks warrants. I am sure the member for Denison is very familiar with all of this given his background. So the process with respect to ASIO has the issuing authority as the ministerâ€”that is, the Attorney-Generalâ€”and with respect to the

If you are on the public interest advocate panel, I suspect you would spend a long, long, long time waiting for the opportunity to make a submission in respect of a warrant application relating to a journalist to the Attorney-General. It is a rare occurrence even with the police, but a very rare occurrence with ASIO.

                                                  The minister has touched on an issue which I seek further clarification on. In his submission, the member for Blaxland saidâ€”and I believe he was speaking on behalf of the oppositionâ€”that the amendments that have been secured would require anyone who wanted a warrant with respect to a journalist to approach a judge. He used the word 'judge' repeatedly. He said it is the judge who issues the warrants. So you would have a chance, as a public interest advocate, to argue in front of a judge that warrants should or should not be issued. I am after clarification as to whether that is in fact right. Are the member for Blaxland and the Labor Party are right in saying that, under these amendments, all of these warrants will have to be argued in front of a judge, or whether the effect of 180L is that some of them will not have to be argued in front of a judge and will in fact be argued in front of the esteemed Attorney-General.

So that it is clear: the requirement for journalist information warrants, which is the term, where they are sought by the organisation, which is

                                                    â€”and there may be other security agencies; I just do not know, because I did not have time to read these amendments in detailâ€”are wanting to seek a warrant for something that a journalist is doing, and it may be that the journalist is perhaps talking to someone in a government department who is raising concerns to them about potentially even the minister himself or herself as the case may be, that process does not get argued out in front of a judge. What will happen if a journalist is talking to someone and ASIO wants to know a bit more about it is that, in a closed process, ASIO would go to the minister, who may in a future government be the minister that the journalist is actually investigating, and it will never be argued in front of a judge. All that will happen is that this new public interest advocate will have the right to make a submission to the Attorney-General, but that otherwise it will never come in front of a judge. Is that correct? And is that the intention of this amendment?

If that is right, I wonder whether it is up to them as to whether they want to stand up. I wonder whether the Labor Party agrees with that or whether they have been sold a pup, because that is pretty significant and it is not in accordance with what I understood from previous submissions from the opposition side to be the level of protection accorded in these amendments. In the short time available to us, that is one question which we have been able to point to. Can the minister explain under what agency or under whose control the public advocate will be, within the government department. Can the minister also explain who they will report to and how much funding this public advocate will get.

                                                       The short answer, as the honourable member knows, is that
                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                                       warrants have always been issued by the minister, so there is absolutely no change from that practice. The change in respect of accessing metadata, a warrant relating to a journalist and his sources, is that a warrant is needed at all. So, from the perspective of the honourable member, as a I divine it, this is a considerable improvement. If his objection is that the minister, the Attorney-General, should not be issuing warrants in respect of applications by ASIO then that is a much bigger question that relates to the whole range of warrants that the organisation may be seeking. As far as the role of the minister vis-a-vis ASIO and warrants is concerned, this is very much status quo.

                                                           It is an English word, and it describes an occupationâ€”a very important occupation. It is not defined in the act. Assuming it was ever controversial, perhaps some day a court could look at it. The reference, of course, is to a journalist working as a professional in a professional capacity, so I think that it is very well understood. I do not anticipate there being any problems arising. Some issues of interpretation of words arise even when you try to define them elaborately. I think that it is a very well understood term.

                                                            I wonder if, in that respect, whether it includes a blogger because we have heard on several occasions from this government, including from the minister, about the transformative role of the internet in journalism. In many respects I agree with the minister. There are now many people who would say they are performing activities as journalists, which are similar to the functions that used to be carried out by journalists, but they may not be in the employ of a media organisation. They may be doing freelance work. It might be that they are in the employ of someone else, but that someone is not considered to be a traditional media organisation.

                                                            A very real question will now arise because although, historically, we might know what a journalist isâ€”yes; it is an English word and I hope most of the words in this set of amendments are English wordsâ€”and it has been clear, historically, what a journalist is. But there is now a very real question in the context of a bill about what happens on the internet. In the context of a bill that is about surveillance of metadata, surely it is something that ought to have been considered in that contextâ€”whether people who do things online as bloggers, and the like, count as journalists. That has certainly that has been agitated for more broadly. It is certainly something that has been raised by journalists, amongst others. I do not think that it is at all fanciful to ask the question about whether someone who is publishing solely online in the form of a blog, and who might not be in the employ of someone else, would count as a journalist. I wonder whether that has been given any thought in the preparation of this, or whether being a journalist is perhaps comparable to being in the

                                                            I ask the minister to explain with respect to bloggers in particular. Will bloggers be counted as journalists for the purposes of this? If they are not, what that means is apparentâ€”the full force of this legislation applies to a blogger. A blogger is someone who would be conducting most of their activity online and, you would argue in many respects, most of their journalism. They would be doing that online, so a blogger is certainly someone who wants to maintain the security and privacy of their communications with others in same way as a journalist would.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            They are, in fact, less likely to be in the same vein as those the member of Denison referred to, who you would have a phone call with and communicate with by the old means. They are much more likely to be conducting their activities online and, as such, are more likely to be caught within the remit of this legislation. For them, it is probably even more important that they be covered. Given that these amendments have been moved apparently with some significant thought and preparationâ€”even though we have not had the courtesy of seeing them in this parliament and being able to consider them for any extended period of timeâ€”surely this question of online-only journalism ought to have been considered. It is something that has been raised in the public debates. If the minister's response is, 'Some of these issues have been canvassed publicly over several years, so surely we are in a position to move on'â€”well, this is something that has been canvassed in the years gone by, and especially online. I ask the minister the simple question: does a blogger count as a journalist?

Does that mean that they have to be in the employ of someone else? For a blogger to count as a journalist, does that mean they have to be a member of a registered organisation? What if the person who is the blogger operates in a number of other capacities and not just as a journalist?

                                                              Given the minister's answer, and given that, at the end of the day, some very, very serious consequences hang on thisâ€”namely, whether or not your activity online, and who you speak to or do not speak to, is going to be kept for two years, which might be of great significance to someone who is an investigative journalist and who does it in the course of being a bloggerâ€”there ought now, at least, to be some clarity as to whether or not that person counts as a journalist.
                                                             </p>

                                                              If the minister's answer is, 'If you are doing it in your professional capacity as a blogger, then you count as a journalist', can we have some clarity about what counts as a 'professional capacity'? Let's give some examples: someone who is in the employ of another organisationâ€”are they acting in their professional capacity? Someone who is not in the employ of another organisation but this is their sole means of staying aliveâ€”are they acting in a professional capacity? Someone who does it not because they are getting paid but because they believe in what they are doingâ€”is that someone who is doing it in their professional capacity. As the minister suggests, do you have to be otherwise employed as a journalist and someone who blogs, or can you be someone who is not separately a journalistâ€”in the employ of the

Some very, very important questions hang on this, so, given the reference from the ministerâ€”

If we were to give this bill precedence over the 90-second statements, we could deal with the bill before question time, but, if the honourable member wants to keep talking about the definition of 'journalists' for another half an hour or so, we can allow 90-second statements. It is really a question of whether the honourable member wants to run down the clock or not. That is the issue.
