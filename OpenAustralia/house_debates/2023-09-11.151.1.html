        Sport and the connection that it provides are important in a young person's life. Less than a decade out from the Brisbane Olympics, the Queensland Labor government has slashed funding to grassroots sporting organisations. I'll continue to advocate for sporting clubs in Petrie, including to support the work of three great sporting clubs in the electorate: the Redcliffe Tigers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC" rel="nofollow">
         AFC
        </a>
        , Aussie rules; Padres Baseball Club, which includes softball; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Power" rel="nofollow">

        football club, or soccer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Redcliffe Tigers AFC, which had its youth presentation over the weekend, is a rapidly growing club. I want to congratulate rising star Allyson Hay on her achievement, along with the other boys and girls who have had a great season. Ninety per cent of players are local. The Redcliffe Tigers

        club have been working hard behind the scenes to develop plans to upgrade their current facilities to accommodate their growing needs, especially for female teams. I promised funding under a re-elected coalition government at the 2022 election to deliver much-needed women's change room facilities. Labor promised nothing. A commitment of $1 million would enable the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        city council to deliver the change rooms sooner, supporting women's sport. I asked for support by the signing of a petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Padres Baseball Club, currently in their preseason, are looking out for juniors and seniors wanting to join the club across their baseball and softball programs. The programs are growing rapidly, and they also need an upgrade. A million-dollar commitment from the federal government would include the demolition of the existing softball clubhouse, a concept plan estimate, and the design and construction of new district-level clubhouses, amenities, first aid offices, internal storage and food and beverage rooms that would give them an income-producing asset. That could be delivered through the council as well. We've already put a lot of money into this club in the past, including from the former federal coalition government and the Moreton Bay city council to upgrade lighting, but more needs to be done, so I would ask you to sign my petition for the Padres.

        The Peninsula Power football club is a force to be reckoned with in the region, with many teams currently playing in the finals. The men's over-45s, with my name as a sponsor, recently won, which was great. It is important that we secure facilities for Peninsula Power as well. We've previously upgraded their sporting clubhouse at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ" rel="nofollow">
         AJ
        </a>
        Kelly Park, but there is more to do. They need a lighting upgrade as well, because I think they'll make it to the A-League one day. They're that sort of club. They're the strongest in the region and ranked very highly throughout the country. Thank you to all the volunteers at Peninsula Power for what you do. In the lead-up to the Olympics and with the success of the Matildas, who came fourth in the World Cup recently, more people will join football, so I'll keep advocating for those three clubs.
