       <p>
        I would like to contribute to statements on this matter moved by the Prime Minister last week on Vietnam
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans Day
        </a>
        . In doing so, I mention the wonderful service held in the electorate of Casey on Sunday prior to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam Veterans
        </a>
        Day, Sunday, 14 August. It was a service organised and hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        Vietnam Veterans Day Combined Service Committee. It is an initiative of the Vietnam veterans community, the Outer Eastern Sub-Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, many of the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        s within the Yarra Valley in outer eastern Melbourne, including Healesville, Lilydale, Upper Yarra, Warburton and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Glen" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Glen
        </a>
        , and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Service" rel="nofollow">
         National Service
        </a>
        man's Association. I know the Croydon RSL were also represented at the service, which was held in the Lilydale main street on Sunday morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to the members of those RSLs who were there. I want to pay tribute to those Vietnam veterans from each of those RSLs and from surrounding areas who came to that service. The service was larger than in previous years. I make mention of that because I think it is the hope of all of us in this House that the importance of this day continues to grow. Vietnam Veterans Day is a time to reflect on so many matters associated with that long conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken on a number of occasions before in the House about some of those issues. I particularly reflect, as many members would, on the issues surrounding the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        and the failure to award medals and appropriate citations after that battle. I do so having known one of the great heroes of the Battle of Long Tan, Cliff Dohle, now deceased, who was a helicopter pilot in that battle. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table is very familiar with the details of the battle and with the story of Cliff Dohle, who passed away a short while back. He performed a pivotal role on the day. Cliff and his wife retired to the Yarra Valley. Getting to know Cliff by meeting him in my electorate office and hearing those stories firsthand is something I have spoken about before. It is only natural that on each Vietnam Veterans Day I think of Cliff and reflect on the Battle of Long Tan.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also a time to candidly reflect on how we as a nation treated returning Vietnam servicemen. Former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister John Howard
        </a>
        told the parliament back in 2006 that the entire Australian community failed the servicemen when they returned from Vietnam. All of us know that that is right; that some of those servicemen returning from Vietnam were treated disgracefully and appallingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we celebrate Vietnam Veterans Day, it is a time to remember their contribution and those who lost their lives, and to think of those men who are now taking leadership roles in our RSLs. It is a time to reflect on the past, but equally a time to look to the future. I know that both sides of the House will agree that they are performing leadership roles at so many levels within local RSLs as, with the effluxion of time, we wave goodbye to so many of the World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
         Korean War
        </a>
        generation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some progress has been made on the issue of the Long Tan medals; I would really like to acknowledge that to the House. It was a difficult issue to try to address many years after that conflict. On Vietnam Veterans Day, we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War and the more than 500 who lost their lives in that conflict. We say thanks as a nation for their contribution. We say 'well done' for the contribution that many continue to make in leadership roles within local RSL clubs.

        <p>
         It is a great honour to speak in this debate. I thank the member for Casey for his fine remarks and his recognition and acknowledgement of the importance of Long Tan Day, and more generally the importance of recognising the contribution of our Vietnam veterans to the Australian nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is hard for us to understand that over a decade 60,000 Australian men served in Vietnam and of those, sadly, 521 were killed in action or died as a result of their wounds, and over 3,000 were wounded. It is very difficult for those of us who sit in a place like this and who have never worn an Australian uniform—whether it is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         , Army or Navy—to understand or appreciate what that actually means. Yes, the war in Vietnam was an unpopular war and, yes, almost half of the Australian men serving there were national servicemen, many of whom did not elect to go. But they went and they went to carry out government policy. This was a choice of government and government, as we know, is the voice of the people. Although we might not understand or even be able to imagine the horror of this conflict, our forebears in this place bear the responsibility for having sent these men to war, so we wear that responsibility. We have to understand and appreciate what actually happened and the depth of sorrow and anguish that results from decisions to send people to war and to see and to know what the long-term implications are of an effort such as this where we lose 521 brave men.

         at which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were both present. The Prime Minister gave what I thought was a very fine speech. It was a cold wintery morning, very unlike anything that would have been experienced in Vietnam, but many came to pay their respects to the fallen and remember and pay tribute to the service of so many of our fellow Australians.

         held fast against a large enemy force in the battle of Long Tan. This battle on 18 August was one of the most significant engagements by the Australian forces during the war. There were others. But the importance of this bloody engagement cannot be underestimated—108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers fought a pitched battle against an estimated 2,000 determined
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">

         and Vietcong enemy at a rubber plantation near Long Tan. On this terrible day 18 Australians were killed, the most killed in any one engagement of the war in Vietnam.

        <p>
         To recognise their extraordinary gallantry in action, veterans of Delta Company were presented with the unit citation of gallantry by the Governor-General, Her Excellency Mrs

          Oruzgan Province
         </a>
         in Afghanistan between 20 January and 30 October 2010. It was indeed a proud and very special moment for all involved to see the younger veterans and our Vietnam veterans together on parade and receiving recognition together for their service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian service in Vietnam spanned over 10 years and we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of Australian service personnel during that entire period. These battles in Vietnam were difficult battles. They were close pitched and intense, fought in difficult conditions. Our service personnel fought in the Anzac spirit, with great courage, conviction and valour.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is worthwhile pointing out that a number of years ago we still had four
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIA" rel="nofollow">
          MIA
         </a>
         s in Vietnam. We have discovered where those MIAs have been. We have recovered their remains and we have brought them home. So their final resting place is in the holy soil of Australia, their home. Sadly though, as we well know, in times past as a nation we have not recognised the service of our veterans from this war as we should have. Vietnam
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Veterans Day
         </a>
         provides the nation with an opportunity to pause and reflect, to remember the service of our Vietnam veterans and pay tribute to those gone before, and to learn from our past so that we may better look after our ADF personnel of today and the future. This is not the time to talk about what we need to do for our current serving personnel but we need to do more.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am a child of this generation when the war was deeply unpopular here at home. I knew people who were conscientious objectors. I knew people who were national servicemen who went to war. I knew people who were injured by that war, either mentally or physically. Sadly, as they get older, sometimes their difficulties increase. We have yet to come to terms and really understand the depth of hurt which many of these men carry with them today and appreciate what that means for us. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure as with previous ministers for veterans' affairs, I speak on behalf of the nation when I say to these veterans that, despite your experiences of the past, we are absolutely committed to providing the best we possibly can for your welfare and for your health and that of your families as you get older.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that in this country we are living longer and for the many people with challenges that remain, with demons which they cannot expunge, we will work with them to help them get on top of them—and we will. We will continue to do what others have done before. But the message here is very clear to us: as I said at the outset, we in this place bear a special responsibility. It is governments that send people to war. We wear a special responsibility towards our past veterans and today's veterans. We cannot do as was done in the past and ignore their pleas and ignore their needs. We need to accommodate them and work with them to satisfy them. I am committed to doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
         This day last week was a special day for Australian veterans who served in that war, and for their families. For so many, the families are the ones who bore the burden of the hurt and many still do. We have a special obligation to defence force men and women and their families. Whatever their service, we need to continue to diligently apply ourselves to making sure that they get the very best we can offer.

         <p>
          With parliament sitting last week, regrettably many of us were unable to attend services in our own electorates. Nonetheless, it should be recorded in this place that, particularly in an electorate like Dickson, we have a vibrant veterans community and they are people who stand very proud for their service, for the loss and sacrifice that they and many of their friends have endured over the course of their service. We salute their service, not just here but right around the country at those ceremonies last week.
         </p>
         <p>
          The 18th of August this year marked the 45th anniversary of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
           Battle of Long Tan
          </a>
          . With all such anniversaries there has to be a lot of reflection but even more so on this 45th anniversary of the gallantry of those who fought in the historic Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. It was a battle which was recognised by the presentation of the Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry by the Governor-General,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Bryce" rel="nofollow">

          at Enoggera, Brisbane, home of the 6th Battalion of the RAR. I understand that was a very moving ceremony. All of us have over the years heard different stories from veterans in our community about their recollections passed down to them, about the Battle of Long Tan. The youngest Australian to die in that battle was just 19 and the oldest was only 22 and, as I understand, from listening to somebody recently, over half of those killed were Queensland national servicemen. They are men whose bravery will never be forgotten.

          These are all people of considerable talent and they have all in their own ways made considerable sacrifices. Not only have they made a sacrifice; their families have of course made significant sacrifices as well. At the memorial service at Black Duck Cottage last Thursday morning, Mr Farrelly was the guest speaker. I was given a copy of his speech. I found it quite moving and I want to contribute a little of his speech as part of this debate today. I want to quote him to allow the House to gain an understanding of the quality of the speech that he presented and also the message that he wanted to deliver. The speech reads as follows:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Australian military troops served in the Vietnam War from 1962 through to 1975. It was the longest conflict that Australian servicemen and women fought and served in during our military's short history. It is without doubt also one of the most controversial of wars that any country served, and divided a nation that led to riots and divisions that remain today. It has left a lasting legacy that will take several generations to finally put this part of Australia's history to rest, and during this time it continues to provoke arguments that rekindle and revise the merits of this conflict.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          During this period 521 Australian servicemen were killed in Vietnam. In excess of 3,000 servicemen were wounded, whilst some 60,000 military personnel served. Many of these doing two and sometimes three tours of duty. To be able to put troops into the country and to keep our numbers up to the required quota,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Service" rel="nofollow">
           National Service
          </a>
          was made compulsory for young Australians. Any male aged between 17 to 21 and born during a certain month were balloted. National Service evoked controversy from all sides of politics and civilian life and ultimately led to some of the most violent clashes between rioters and police this country has ever seen.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Australia has since recovered all of its war

          's in operations that defy the massive procedures undertaken to achieve this remarkable feat. Using old memories, maps, co-ordinates given during battle and the ever changing landscape a few dedicated Australian people have painstakingly traced and tracked our war dead and ceremonially returned their remains to their Australian families.
         </p>
         <p>
          These people continue their work in Vietnam but now assist in the search for the remains of

          servicemen who died and were buried in the field. At the war's height more than 500,000 American servicemen were in country, where their losses exceeded 60,000.
         </p>
         <p>
          Peter's speech goes on:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          As Australian troops began the main withdrawal in September 1971, those who had returned home earlier found themselves ostracised by friends, the RSL, and even the military which had sent them there in the first place. There was no support from the military; the RSL did not want to know us, and in some instances families did not welcome them home. Increasingly ex-serving soldiers became loners, and sought refuge with other like-minded veterans where they could relate to each other without fear or condemnation. From this the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia was formed which united the veterans and unified them into a cohesive and powerful veteran voice. They remain the choice of many service organisations today.
         </p>
         <p>
          The speech went on for a little bit beyond that in most eloquent words and closed in this way:

          and the 45th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. A day when Australians remember all those servicemen and servicewomen who served, suffered and died. A day to reflect and commemorate not only fellow Australians but our American and New Zealand comrades in arms and a time to reflect on the misery of the

          people that this war ultimately inflicted. To those servicemen and servicewomen who perished in South Vietnam and to those veterans who have since passed, rest in peace my friends. We do remember you all. Lest we forget.
         </p>
         <p>
          They are powerful words; they are words that speak very strongly for a generation of families who were disproportionately affected by what was a terrible war. It is not a pretty picture of our history, and the way in which people were ultimately treated for their presence in Vietnam, both at the time of their engagement and on return from their engagement, shone an even poorer light on the behaviour of some in this country.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I said in my opening remarks, we have a very strong local veterans community. Over the course of the last 10 years I have made it my business to befriend and support wherever I can many of the veterans in our local community. I know that in the area of Kallangur, which is on the border of the electorate of Longman, Wyatt Roy has embarked on a similar process. We want to continue to help and assist those veterans and those families who still suffer many of those wounds, particularly mentally, today. We want to make sure that we continue to provide support wherever possible to those families and to the generations that follow, 'where the pain is still felt most surely,' as Peter mentioned in his speech. I close with the mission statement of the Vietnam Veterans Association, which is: 'To assist all veterans, dependants and their descendants in all matters relating to their health, welfare and wellbeing'. We can all be proud of their ongoing service. To the veterans in the Dickson community, I say thank you.

           Day is a day for all Australians to pay tribute to those who served in the Vietnam War. The day is commemorated each year on the anniversary of the

            Battle of Long Tan
           </a>
           , one of the most significant Australian actions of the Vietnam War. This year marked the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. This battle occurred on 18 August 1966 and during this battle 18 Australians were killed—the most killed in any one engagement of the Vietnam War—and 24 were wounded. In the years since it was fought, many people have said the battle has achieved a symbolic significance for the Australian military in the Vietnam War which is similar to that of other battles Australians remember, such as the Gallipoli campaign, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
            Kokoda Track
           </a>
           and the Battle of Kapyong. Indeed, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War remains the longest in duration of any war in Australia's history. It lasted from August 1962 until May 1975. Although the Australian commitment was predominantly Army personnel, there were also significant numbers of civilians as well as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Air Force
           </a>
           and Navy personnel. According to the Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans, almost 60,000 Australians served in Vietnam and 521 Australians died as a result of the war, with over 3,000 wounded. Of the 521 Australian who died in the war, 496 were

           personnel. The involvement of Australian forces in Vietnam was a gradual escalation, taking place over many years, and our forces battled against extremes of terrain and climate, through dense jungle and monsoonal conditions. They faced a very well-organised force.
          </p>
          <p>
           We must never forget the service and sacrifice of those very brave Australians; they fought with such great courage and valour in the face of adversity. As many speakers have commented on today, when those Australian troops came home from Vietnam they returned to a nation that was really divided in its view of the war and, mostly, they were not welcomed home by a grateful nation in the same way as troops returning home from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">

            II
           </a>
           were welcomed before them. For many of the surviving Vietnam veterans, time has not always healed the physical and psychological scars that resulted from their service, and often their families share this physical and emotional burden. It is important to acknowledge that the aftermath of war has been difficult to deal with, and we should recognise the contribution that veterans' families also have made. That is just as vitally important. In acknowledging the very difficult time that many of our veterans had when they came home, it is important to realise, too, that the veterans of the Vietnam War did not receive an official welcome home parade until 1987. That was a significant period of time later and was an issue, understandably, for many of those veterans. It is for this reason, and of course for so many other reasons, that on 18 August each year Australia as a nation recognises, remembers and honours the veterans of the Vietnam War.
          </p>
          <p>
           My electorate of Richmond has one of the largest numbers of veterans throughout the nation. It has been my honour to meet and work with many of them over the years and to see their great commitment in so many ways. I note that many of them are veterans of the Vietnam War. As other speakers have mentioned, with parliament sitting last week, many of us were not able to attend local events. One of my staff members, Jodie Bellchambers, attended the event of a Vietnam veterans group in my electorate and she laid a wreath on behalf of the Commonwealth. Peter Crockett, a veteran, a lovely man whom we all refer to as 'Davy' Crockett, has organised this event for many years. It is held at South Tweed Sports club, which has supported the veterans group. The club has a lovely memorial garden, and the service is held there every year. I certainly would like to commend Davy for organising this very important event. I know there are many events locally and throughout the nation. It is important that we continue to have those events so that we can take the time to remember the service and sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also like to note that the Governor-General marked the day last week on behalf of the nation with the presentation of a unit citation to

          </p>
          <p>
           In concluding today, I would like to quote from Paul Keating's speech at the funeral service of the Unknown Australian Soldier on 11 November, 1993. The Unknown Australian Soldier was a casualty of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            First World War
           </a>
           , but I believe the sentiments translate to all our veterans from all wars, who have made such sacrifices in the defence of our nation.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           For out of the war came a lesson which transcended the horror and tragedy and the inexcusable folly. It was a lesson about ordinary people – and the lesson was that they were not ordinary. On all sides they were the heroes of that war; not the generals and the politicians but the soldiers and sailors and nurses – those who taught us to endure hardship, to show courage, to be bold as well as resilient, to believe in ourselves, to stick together.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Unknown Australian Soldier whom we are interring today was one of those who, by his deeds, proved that real nobility and grandeur belongs, not to empires and nations, but to the people on whom they, in the last resort, always depend.

            has relevance in terms of my own life experiences as I am of that vintage. As young men and women, we grew up at a time when Australia was committing to the Vietnam War and to the conflict there. We know of some of the events that occurred over a period of time but the footage we saw on television for the first time covered the conflict from its beginning to its end. From those images, we had a sense of some of the challenges that Australian service men and women were experiencing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over 60,000 Australians served in the Vietnam conflict. Sadly, 521 paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and its interests. Some 47,000 Vietnam veterans are alive today and it is for them, their fallen comrades and the families affected that we remember them specifically every year. There are many Vietnam veterans in Hasluck. I often believe that, as members of parliament, we have an incredible privilege in meeting, working and talking with the service men and women who served in many fronts and in many campaigns on behalf of this country. Service men and women when called do not ask; they serve. I have had the privilege and honour to meet with some of these men in my first year in office. The pride with which they acknowledge their service, the regret they express at the loss of life and the frustration of their treatment on returning home from Vietnam makes me truly humble. The pictorial representations that were so strong in those days have etched in my memory the way we treated some of our servicemen returning home from that conflict.

            . In 1966, 18 young Australians died and 24 were wounded in what would become the stuff of legend. I remember the headlines in the local papers that were common in Perth at that time. I particularly remember a cartoon—and I am sure it was drawn by

           <p>
            Most of these men were not regular soldiers. Many of us of a certain age will remember the controversy surrounding conscription and the drafting of Australia's young men into the armed forces. At Long Tan, conscripts faced off against some of North Vietnam's toughest soldiers and they held themselves and their country in high regard. As a result, a long overdue Unit Citation for Gallantry was awarded last week to D Company of the 6

            . I honour their courage and am pleased that this nation finally recognises the true sacrifice our armed forces made in this decade-long conflict, which shaped the sixties and the seventies. I have friends who served in the Vietnam War and each one has a different story to tell of their service. Some received devastating physical wounds, but all of them were wounded emotionally and mentally in some capacity. It has taken Australian society a long time to understand and acknowledge issues such as post traumatic stress disorder and the impact they have on returning soldiers and their families. I would like to think that we have learnt from these lessons and are prepared for our troops returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. But more needs to be done.
           </p>
           <p>
            I held a recent forum with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Michael Ronaldson. Veterans from the conflicts of World War
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
             II
            </a>
            , Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Iraq and Afghanistan came together to talk about their issues. The recurring theme was one of helplessness that our Vietnam veterans felt on return, especially for those who were physically incapacitated as a result of their service, and the impact that that has had on the quality of life. It was very interesting listening to the stories that they shared with us of both their pride of having served their country and the frustration they have for what they termed a 'continuing war', whilst retaining recognition for the rights and entitlements that they were seeking for both the physical, emotional and mental impact that that war had. Certainly, their shared stories brought back to me memories of three people in particular: Peter Keilor, who comes from the town of Corrigin; and two brothers, Peter and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stone" rel="nofollow">
             David Stone
            </a>
            , who are twins, who also served in Vietnam. All three, as I remember them, went away as strong young men. They returned, but Peter lost his limbs, having stood on a mine. David and Peter shared some of their stories but never shared the detail, but certainly indicated their pride in having served.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to thank Senator Michael Ronaldson and the shadow minister for defence, Senator David Johnston, for making it such an informative day for all those who attended, especially those veterans who were in attendance. I am sure that we are all proud of these men because they, as service men and women, fought to ensure that the freedoms we have and we will always enjoy are endured long into the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am equally as proud of the Returned and Services Leagues that call Hasluck home. The Gosnells
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
             RSL
            </a>
            is a very vibrant group of returned servicemen. The Bellevue RSL and the Kalamunda RSL all represent their members well. I enjoy the camaraderie of the discussions that I have with them on issues that they raise. Issues about ex-Vietnamese servicemen now dominate their agenda, and the coalition continues to work hard to shape appropriate policy in this area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earlier this year I held a Saluting Their Service ceremony in my electoral office. I was fortunate enough to be able to present several Vietnam War veterans with a certificate acknowledging their efforts in this brutal conflict. What was really warming, and it quite touched me and my staff, was not just sitting there, listening to them as veterans swapped their stories, their experiences about the challenges that they still grapple with but being able to contribute to that discussion. They were all men of different ages, from different conflicts, with different experiences but, from their perspective, they were all Australians who served their country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again, I want to acknowledge the 60,000 service personnel who served in Vietnam and sacrificed so much in the name of this great country. Our armed forces do not choose where they fight, but they fight when called upon and they must always be honoured and respected. It is the foundation upon which this nation was built. I want to acknowledge their contribution and ask that we never forget what they have given us. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

            <p>
             It is an honour to speak on this issue today and it is a day when we recall not just the events of this very significant battle in the Vietnam War but commemorate the entire service of our men and women in the Vietnam War. It is in that spirit that I would like to draw attention to the range of experiences of the people who served in and survived that conflict. Those who came back injured, of course, are often forgotten among the stories of the casualties who did not come back, those who were killed in action. But those who did come back suffered horrendously in relation to the disabilities they acquired. In that conflict so many more survived to live on than in previous conflicts because the battlefield service of our medical services was so good in Vietnam. But they lived with horrendous injuries nevertheless. In fact I was recruited by Brigadier Billy Rolfe, who lost both legs in Vietnam and still went on to make a great deal of his life afterwards. He became a brigadier in the Army, he was a well-known rugby fanatic who coached teams, and he went on and got himself a law degree as well. He was typical of that spirit, the veteran who was not going to be defeated by such horrendous injuries. Quite often in the past those injuries would have led to death in the battlefield, but so many Vietnam veterans did come home to fight that battle.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those who did not come back to the Army there was a real problem. They went back to a community that, in large degree, either ignored or vilified them. There was either apathy or actual aggression. Both sides of politics let these veterans down. For them it was particularly tough. To endure the things that they had had to endure and to perform their duty in the way they had had to perform it and then not to have support from their community was particularly psychologically devastating. I think we have all learned the lessons of that period. In the case of veterans who now return from conflicts such as Iraq, where there was also controversy, everyone across the spectrum has learned that you do not take out these issues on the veterans. It is the political masters who have to answer for making such decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think those who came back and stayed in the Army had an easier time because they were respected and admired within the Army for their service and for what they had accomplished. The Army that I joined—in terms of the key ingredients, the key bones and sinews and intellect that drove our organisation during my early service—was shaped and driven and influenced by that core of Vietnam veterans that fleshed out the entire organisation. I benefited enormously from the training that I received from those veterans. The training that they provided me helped me survive through the deployments that I went on to serve in, but the whole organisation benefited. The received wisdom that was passed down through the generations that have served since is still there in our Army and it has enabled us to serve well in similarly complex operational environments—these counterinsurgency environments. When we went to Somalia with the 1st Battalion,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Australian Regiment
             </a>
             , the very first thing Lieutenant General David Hurley, who is now our
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Chief of the Defence Force
             </a>
             , said was, 'Well, this looks to me like a counterinsurgency type of environment.' And he went on to apply all of those intuitive things that he had learned at the hands of the Vietnam veterans who had trained us. I pay tribute to all of them who put me through the mill at Battle Wing in Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, where of course most of those Vietnam veterans also did their predeployment training to go to Vietnam.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I think they coped better when they were in the Army, in an organisation that valued their service. But then there were the families of those who came back who did not have that support. The families certainly endured a great deal in living with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and we should really acknowledge all that they went through over the many years that they had to cope with those psychological issues and other, physical, issues that their family members came back with. Their support for their people and their sacrifice on behalf of this nation as well, not only for those who lost their lives but for those they had to support, is certainly something that we should acknowledge as well as part of the commemoration of this day. We do need to have a better understanding of the day itself. It took a long time before we really appreciated the full strategic and tactical importance of this battle.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Company" rel="nofollow">
              Delta Company
             </a>
             , only a company-strength unit, took on two manoeuvre units of the enemy—the Vietcong 275th Regiment, which itself was composed largely of regulars from the north and the famous, or infamous, D445 battalion of local force Vietcong. So two large manoeuvre units confronted a subunit, the Delta Company, of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. As has been pointed out, they were vastly outnumbered. One thing that strikes you as you read about this battle, or if you see the transcripts or hear the recordings of the radio telephone traffic that took place during the battle, is that you really appreciate the professionalism of these soldiers. Through the incredible stress of what was going on, they maintained their discipline and their professionalism in directing the fire support that they received was first class, and was what actually saved the members of the unit who were able to survive the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
             In that respect, I pay tribute today particularly to the

              New Zealander

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Artillery" rel="nofollow">
              Royal New Zealand Artillery
             </a>
             —and to the service that Captain Morrie Stanley rendered that day. Morrie, unfortunately, passed away on 16 September last year. He was a tremendous professional but also a really fine man. He had tremendous empathy for the soldiers whom he was trying to support. You can see that if you watch the very fine documentary that the Foxtel company produced on this battle. I am so glad that we have that oral history of Morrie, since he left us last year. It was a poignant moment for other veterans of the battle who were able to see him in hospital and hand over to him the decorations that we were able to obtain in recognition of what this battle actually meant.
            </p>
            <p>
             This battle for appropriate recognition was a long-fought battle, particularly by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith" rel="nofollow">
              Harry Smith
             </a>
             , on behalf of his soldiers over many years. It was only recently that we understood that the efforts of Delta Company in fact saved the 1st Australian Task Force, which at that time was still establishing itself. This was a concerted effort by the enemy to annihilate the task force. Not only did Delta Company and the supporting elements achieve the success that they did and defeat that objective; also, through the overwhelming casualties that were caused to the enemy, they really devastated them to the extent that they were not able to mount such an effort ever again in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuoc_Tuy" rel="nofollow">
              Phuoc Tuy
             </a>
             province. As a result, we were able to contribute to other efforts elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             This battle for appropriate recognition is something that is a bit of a shame on this country. I am so pleased that we were finally able to bring that to conclusion. Certainly, we know that the quota system, the system that applied at the time, really denied some of the key players of that battle the recognition that they deserved, such as Harry Smith whose award recommendation was downgraded. So we were able to give him the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Gallantry" rel="nofollow">
              Star of Gallantry
             </a>
             and, similarly, second lieutenants Geoff Kendall and Dave Sabben had their decorations upgraded to the Medal of Gallantry. Subsequent to that, we established the Honours and Awards Tribunal, which looked after a few other unfinished business elements of the battle, such as in relation to Cliff Dohle, one of the Iroquois pilots awarded the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross" rel="nofollow">
              Distinguished Flying Cross
             </a>
             for his efforts, and of course the overall awarding of the Unit Citation for Gallantry to Delta Company. They were of course, back in 1968, acknowledged by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
              President Johnson
             </a>
             with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Unit_Citation" rel="nofollow">
              Presidential Unit Citation
             </a>
             , which I know the unit wears with pride.
            </p>
            <p>
             An element of controversy was the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">
              South Vietnam
             </a>
             ese intention towards Delta Company. I was able to get together with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ham" rel="nofollow">
              Paul Ham
             </a>
             , the Vietnam War historian, to get to the bottom of this issue. We were able to uncover diplomatic traffic that clearly indicated that it had been the intention of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">
              South Vietnamese
             </a>
             government to award the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gallantry" rel="nofollow">
              Cross of Gallantry
             </a>
             with Palm Unit Citation to that unit. At the time the Australian government rejected that offer and instead members of the unit were given dolls by the Vietnamese, which as you will appreciate did not quite reflect the significance of their efforts. So we were able to clarify that and the members of the unit were awarded that Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation as well. We have managed to clear up a lot of unfinished business from the years when this was a running sore for people like Harry Smith. I know Harry was not able to get to the award ceremony on 18 August that the Governor-General attended, but Harry has been acknowledged by all his soldiers for the massive effort that he has put in over the years on their behalf. Harry, we really salute you.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been a real privilege for me to have known and had many conversations with Harry, as it has been for me to have known so many of the veterans of this battle—guys like Bob Buick, who I spoke to on the phone only a few days ago. I met many of them at the famous Sporties Bar at 6
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
              RAR
             </a>
             when I was playing rugby for 6RAR. We won the premiership and these veterans would always turn up to Sporties and share their stories with us—a great bunch of blokes; fantastic people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Probably the most poignant and satisfying moment of my time in politics has been the mission to Vietnam that we went on to bring back the remains of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Herbert" rel="nofollow">
              Michael Herbert
             </a>
             and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carver" rel="nofollow">
              Robert Carver
             </a>
             , the last two of our service people missing in action in Vietnam, members of No. 2 Squadron, Magpie squadron, flying Canberra bombers. I went over there with a good friend, Alan Curr, who served with both of them, and with me in Timor. It was an incredibly emotional experience travelling over there with the families and veterans of the unit to bring our last two back. In effect, it is mission accomplished, in that we did not leave anybody behind.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, dealing with the Vietnamese authorities really brought a lot of issues home to us. They were so welcoming, generous and warm hearted in how they received us and the families. It was a tremendous experience, but the poignancy of it was emphasised by the fact that they still have 300,000 of their own missing in action from that war. It is a great source of pride to me that today Australians are assisting the Vietnamese to locate those who are missing in action in battlefields that we served on, and that we have the records and the technical capability to assist them. This is one of the things that is forming a wonderful bond between our two countries now. Something beautiful has actually grown from this horrendous experience. Thousands of Australian students travel to Vietnam, and many Australian tourists as well, and many Vietnamese come to learn and study in Australia. So a wonderful bond and thread has grown up—and also amongst the veterans of both sides in the dealings they have with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, how we address the situation with the mental health issues that they face is something we have been trying to move on with. I am very pleased that we have had the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training program, which we have put $1 million towards, and that we have introduced the comprehensive mental health 'lifecycle' package. This fell out of the improve mental health studies that we instituted, and $92 million has been allocated for the implementation of both those studies. These are some of the things that need to be done to respond to the issues that emerge from these conflicts, and a lot more is still necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will finish by talking about the importance of maintaining the lessons from that war. All of my career has been basically in a counterinsurgency style environment, and all of those lessons that were taught to us by those Vietnam veterans remain relevant today. I am really pleased that finally we have managed to institutionalise that cultural and historical experience by now creating the Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence, which is based out at Queanbeyan. This takes the lessons that we need to learn from counterinsurgency and emphasises that the types of environments and conflicts we are facing in Afghanistan are not just military. They are social, economic and political issues and they all have to be addressed at the same time and meshed with a cohesive strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Having recently spent a week on the ground in Afghanistan, I am delighted to see the impact of that strategy. That reorientation of our approach is really starting to take effect marvellously on the ground in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruzgan_Province" rel="nofollow">
              Oruzgan Province
             </a>
             , which is recognised by the other contingents in Afghanistan and by the Regional Commander South, who has emphasised that Oruzgan is the model that others should emulate if they are to achieve success in Afghanistan. So the spirit, the experience and the service of these veterans from Vietnam lives on in what our troops today are doing on the ground in Afghanistan. I salute what they gave to me and what they gave to the country. It is a proud tradition, a proud record and a proud experience which we should continue to honour in every way possible.

              , just said, the Vietnam War left a lot of scars. Today is not the day to apportion blame to individual groups or political parties but, rather, to recognise that there was unacceptable conduct in our nation by some of our own people, who treated the Vietnam veterans abysmally when they returned from that conflict. Some of the veterans have told me that shortly after they got home they were advised by the military to get into civvies and not go out in their uniform—these fellows were not quite discharged, but they were back in Australia—for fear they would be abused and spat on. That really is a dreadful indictment on all of us. I put myself in that category. It was against that backdrop that those who fought in Vietnam, particularly those who fought in some of the seminal battles, like Firebase Coral and Long Tan, were never properly recognised. In fact, in the case of

              , Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall—whom the parliamentary secretary just spoke about—their honours, recommended at the Battle of Long Tan, were actually downgraded. What a disgrace; what an utter disgrace.

              The 45th anniversary was an opportunity to put that right. We have not been really good at acknowledging some of our heroes, and it is good that we now have a tribunal looking into the cases of people—even of people from the Second World War, like

              . Just imagine that young man going down and firing his machine gun as the waves came up around him! He would not leave his post. It is the stuff of legend. We recently celebrated the death of the White Mouse and her contribution to the war effort. She was the most decorated woman of the Second World War. She was one of ours, but it took us 60 years to acknowledge her effort. The 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan was a time to put some of the ghosts to rest, to put some of our bad attitudes away and to recognise the Battle of Long Tan for what it was.

              I had the honour of being paired with Minister Warren Snowdon and going to Brisbane to see the parade. And what a moving ceremony that was: the whole 6RQR on parade at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoggera_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
               Enoggera Barracks

              ; the

              , Lieutenant General Morrison; the Governor-General; and, most particularly, of those who served at Long Tan there were over 80 soldiers, and widows. When you allow for the 108 who were there and the headquarters people, there were probably 120 in all—Harry Smith says probably about 120—and 80 of them could be there on that day to see the unit honoured. What a phenomenal day it was. The drill was impeccable, the music was perfect and the overlay was these 80 veterans. They have this ceremony where the troops march in open order through the ranks of the serving troops, and seeing them marching through the ranks brought the crowd to its feet with applause.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other thing that struck us was that the Governor-General placed a wreath on the cross. We have different memorials for different activities in our history. If you go around Australia you will find that most of the memorials to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tobruk" rel="nofollow">
               Battle of Tobruk
              </a>
              are in the shape of the memorial that was built in the cemetery at Tobruk. If you go to Vietnam War memorials, you find that quite a lot of them are in the shape of the Long Tan cross, which is a roughly hewn cross with a circular panel, not quite a Celtic cross—I think all the honourable members would know what I am talking about. One of those crosses is at Enoggera Barracks, where the wreath was laid.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mentioned Harry Smith, who was to be awarded the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSO" rel="nofollow">
               DSO
              </a>

               Military Cross
              </a>
              and then upgraded again to the

               Star of Gallantry
              </a>
              , which is the equivalent of the DSO. But the awards for Dave Sabin and Geoff Kendall were downgraded from military crosses to military medals and then upgraded again to the Medal for Gallantry. Dave Sabin had never received his and it was presented to him by the Governor-General, and the Unit Citation for Gallantry, which should have been awarded 44 or 45 years ago, was presented to the other lieutenant, Geoff Kendall. They both served beside Harry Smith in the battle.
             </p>

              Harry attended the Long Tan celebrations in Townsville. As a result of a recent medical treatment, he was not able to fly to Brisbane, and that was a sad thing because if it was anyone's day it was Harry Smith's. As you watched that magnificent parade, you could not help reflecting on what he did on that day. As the parliamentary secretary and others have mentioned, the Battle of Long Tan occurred by chance. A D Company, 6RQR patrol had gone out and, at around midday or early-afternoon, they encountered 2½ thousand Vietcong and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">
               North Vietnamese
              </a>
              regulars—quite a formidable force. As we subsequently know, their real target was the base at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nui_Dat" rel="nofollow">
               Nui Dat
              </a>
              , where there was to be a concert that day with
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Pattie" rel="nofollow">
               Little Pattie

              and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_O'Keefe" rel="nofollow">
               Johnny O'Keefe
              </a>
              . It would have been a light and frothy day, so just imagine 2½ thousand troops descending on that. What a bloodbath that would have been. By chance, while out on patrol, the Australians ended up in battle with this group. They were a well-equipped group, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has just said. They had artillery as well. It was on the edge of the rubber plantation and it was in pouring rain. The battle raged for three hours—105 Australians and three
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealander" rel="nofollow">
               New Zealander
              </a>
              s took on 2,500 North Vietnamese regulars and irregulars. Shocking sorts of odds. You read the battle—and we do not have time to go into every aspect of it—but for example at one stage one of the platoons was surrounded and two other platoons went out to relieve them to fight their way into their position and to get them out back to the Australian line.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then there was Morrie Stanley the New Zealand artillery officer who was lying beside Harry Smith, right at the front, in three inches of muddy water calling down the artillery that was coming from three units—Australian, American and New Zealander. That barrage was exploding in the rubber plantation and was causing devastating injuries to the North Vietnamese attackers. As I said, the battle went on for three hours. At one stage they nearly ran out of ammunition and equally bravely the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
               RAAF
              </a>
              flew in with an improvised drop of ammunition wrapped in blankets in the thick of the battle. That too was enormously courageous.
             </p>
             <p>
              They persisted and they won the battle. They saved most of their unit. Tragically they lost 18 with 24 wounded but one only shudders to think what might have happened if that group had got anywhere near Nui Dat on that day. So they also saved the pride of Australia in that battle and as Parliamentary Secretary Kelly just told us it weakened for all time the role of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong" rel="nofollow">

              and the North Vietnamese regulars in that province. So that was what we celebrated—45 years since that event.

              I stay very close to my Vietnam veterans because I think they have had a rougher time than most. There were even some

              clubs that would not accept them as members, thankfully not a lot, but some would not and that was a great sense of unhappiness to them. They did not lose their sense of camaraderie and having served for Australia and in many towns they formed their owned branches, some as

              You often wonder just how much healing had really gone on but I think it was two or three years ago I went to the Long Tan Day at Hervey Bay and Harry Smith had some of his unit with him; I think there were eight of them. They went up as a group to lay their wreaths and as they laid their wreaths and stepped back the entire crowd—which was considerable I might add—burst into loud and sustained applause. I have never seen that at a wreath laying. Wreath laying is generally a very sombre thing; a reflective thing. But, on that occasion, the members of the public who were there could not contain themselves because they knew the story of how badly these men had been treated as veterans but also, in particular, how badly D company 6
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">

              had been treated in the acknowledgement of what was the seminal battle of the Vietnam War. I return to an earlier theme, when I said we are not very good at recognising our heroes. Two of the 11 have received some awards, but there are still nine who have received only
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MID" rel="nofollow">

              s, mentioned in dispatches, which hardly reflects what went on that day. They were all recommended by Harry on that day for truly exceptional courage, and I will not rest until those 11 are upgraded.
             </p>
             <p>
              I bring that up not to put a political or dark overlay on the celebration of Long Tan Day but rather to say that there is still some unresolved business. We as a nation need to step back and take one last look, as we put this behind us, to make sure that we have honoured truly exceptional courage and, in the case of Harry Smith, Dave Sabben, Geoff Kendall and Morrie Stanley, truly exceptional leadership, and that we do not forget the ones who really stuck their necks out for this country, those last 11. Long Tan Day is a marvellous day, a day that is now well established in the Australian lexicon. I hope that it will lead to complete fulfilment in the coming years, once we have acknowledged the last 11 veterans.

               In the nearly four decades since the end of the Vietnam War, there has been much heartache and much healing. Although people will differ in their opinions on the Vietnam War, I personally want to put on the record my total admiration and respect for and thanks to all those who bravely went to war and how sorry I am for the mistreatment they received on their return. Our troops deserve our unqualified support and respect. These brave men and women are the ones who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country and the beliefs we hold so dearly. For that courage and bravery, I want to say thank you. I, like many Australians, have visited Vietnam and been through

               . I have stood at these sites; I have walked the Luscombe airstrip. I have reflected and paid my respects to the brave Australians. I must say it was a very haunting, emotional and overwhelming experience. I want to thank the tour guide who was with me, an ex-6RAR man, Breaker Cusack. Breaker really brought the whole thing to reality as we walked through the rubber plantations and the silence. With each step he talked about what happened here and what happened there before you finally get to the cross. You pay your respects to soldiers from both sides who fought in that battle. One of the things I noticed in Vietnam was the reconciliation that has happened since that time and the warmth that Australians receive there. It was a very haunting experience to walk through those different battlefields and places of significance for Australian veterans.

They were the ones who put the idea together of the commemorative walk and they are the ones who turned up in droves to see it. One of the most interesting things was to see people who had not seen each other for many, many years getting together, having a celebration and enjoying what had been done by Labor governments, both state and federal, getting together and putting the money in to get this fantastic venture done. It will become a tourist attraction for many of the veterans who are entering the grey nomad phase so they can see the importance of what they have done for our country and to see all their names on a wall.

               —the former member for Gippsland in the Victorian parliament—loaned me a copy of a book titled

               </i>
               by Barry Heard. I read that book straight through from start to finish and could not put it down. It was a fascinating read because it was about Barry's very personal account. It explains how, as a conscript, he was one of the many young men sent off to Vietnam, completely unprepared for the emotional and psychological impact of what they would do and what they would have done to them there. As a result, he spent the next 30 years having 'a slow motion breakdown'. His story of his long journey home from Vietnam is an inspiring story of a life reclaimed and it gives strength to that generation of Australian men who had been through very similar experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since that awakening experience, I have continued to work and support the brave men and women who were prepared to pay the ultimate sacrifice in the name of our country. There are many Vietnam veterans in my community and I can say that they are a dogged lot, especially when it comes to getting funds up and running for this Vietnam veterans commemorative walk. I guess that is what makes them so special. Recently, I was very honoured to present some 'Saluting their service' certificates to two of our finest—locals,

               , residents of McEwen and people whom I am very proud to have made their acquaintance. In doing these ceremonies, we invited one of the primary schools who had just finished doing a term's work on military history. It was an absolute sensation to have those guys there getting their certificates, being recognised for what they have done, and to have this young generation of kids there with so much interest, passion and support for everything that they had been through in their schoolwork.

               As my last note, I would like to say a simple thank you. Time cannot change the past, but what we do know can change the future and make us sure that this episode in Australian history is recognised and given the reverence and attention that it so richly deserves.

                Army. My father was a member of 103 Field Battery and fought gallantly in the battle. It was one of the biggest and most important conflicts in the Vietnam War involving Australian troops. Whilst my father understands and accepts that 103 Field Battery will not receive a citation due military protocols, I believe every member of this battery, and all other support batteries, would be worthy recipients. I have been approached by family members of these men who also believe these soldiers deserve recognition for their efforts during the Battle of Long Tan, even though they were officially attached to 5RAR. It saddened me on
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans" rel="nofollow">

                </a>
                Day last week to have a number of phone calls from people crying and reliving their stories. I believe that these support batteries should be shown the respect and honour they deserve. Surely this is not too much to ask.
               </p>
               <p>
                The battle was one of the most successful campaigns Australian troops have ever been involved in. Eighteen Australians died, while the enemy death toll was put as high as 800. It was August 18 1966 when 108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers of the 6th Battalion, RAR, D Company faced an enemy force of over 2½ thousand. The 103 Field Battery played a pivotal role in this historic battle. Its members pounded the enemy with 1,000 rounds of artillery, a round every 10 seconds, creating a wall of steel around the embattled men of D Company. Revisiting this battle: non-military personnel at the base formed ad hoc teams of labourers and worked through the night in the pouring rain to keep up the supply of ammunition to the guns. The 103 Field Battery had to be resupplied by Iroquois choppers from 9 Squadron
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
                 RAAF
                </a>
                , making the guns a prime target for enemy fire. These men struggled through torrential rain which made aiming the guns almost impossible, leaving gunners to rely on their own intuition to ensure they fired on the enemy and not on the men of D Company. To make a bad situation worse, poisonous cordite fumes from the artillery fire built up a toxic haze around the guns. Despite hardly being able to breathe or even see through the haze, the brave men of the 103rd and 105th field batteries kept up the artillery fire all through the night and into the morning, delivering victory to the Australians. The men involved in the Battle of Long Tan demonstrated courage, bravery and determination in spite of next to impossible conditions.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is for these reasons that I believe that the members of 103 Field Battery are also worthy of citation. Even though military protocol prevents this citation from happening, I will always be immensely proud of my father, Reg, for his courageous actions on that horrific day. Unfortunately, the Vietnam War was especially cruel to the minds and bodies of returned servicemen because of the strong political anti-war sentiments that were rife at the time. While the success of the Battle of Long Tan will be remembered by generations of Australians to come, we must also consider the effect the war has had on many soldiers, their families and the community. I remember vividly as a young child my father returning from Vietnam. We used to go into his bedroom, where he slept with his eyes open, to try and wake him up. He would jump up and nearly strangle you, reliving the war in Vietnam. He slept with his eyes open. He relived every moment of Vietnam in his dreams. I remember him sleepwalking through the house. Still to this day, when I visit him on holiday, my father relives those memories in his dreams. These are things that I will never forget and they touch me deeply. As a young child it was very, very disturbing to see what was happening to my father, and it still happens to him today and to the many Vietnam Veterans who returned from war, especially those who were involved in the Battle of Long Tan.
               </p>

                There are currently more than 500 Vietnam Veterans living in the Macarthur region. I am a member of the Macarthur branch of Australian Vietnam Veterans and I have always supported its members in whatever I can do, particularly in relation to their health and their wellbeing. The veterans of this group are a fantastic group of men who have all fought gallantly for this country. Now they meet on a daily basis to offer support to each other. They have established a museum in memory of those who fought in Vietnam. I am proud of all our local veterans, not only for their courage during battle but for their strength during the anti-war sentiments that targeted our troops after their return home. My hope is that Australia will never allow Defence Force personnel returning from duty to be treated as Vietnam Veterans were. I know that a number of speakers today have touched on this. There are few who will endure the haunting realities of war. We should not take these soldiers' personal sacrifice for granted. My hope for all Australian Vietnam veterans, including my father, is that 45 years later they can all hold their heads up high.

                 It is an honour to follow the member for Macarthur on this. I know this is an issue that is very close to his heart as I recall he spoke about his father's commitment in the Vietnam War in his first speech to the House. I also rise today to pay tribute to the veterans of Long Tan and to all the Australians who served in the Vietnam War. As the member for Fowler—and I have to say this—it probably has an even more special significance for me, given that I also represent one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The commemorations that took place throughout the country on 18 August certainly did stir the emotions and the spirit of all involved in the conflict, their families and those who recognise the effort that was put in on behalf of the nation. As in all other theatres of conflict in which Australian soldiers have served, these Australians served bravely in Vietnam, they served their nation with courage and they served it with distinction.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Having said that—and following the point just made by the member for Macarthur—the veterans of the Vietnam conflict were treated very poorly on their return to this country. No matter what your views may have been with respect to the Vietnam War, those who served this country in our country's interests did not deserve to be treated the way they were when they returned to this country. I would like to put on record my apologies to all those veterans who were subject to that treatment. It is something that needs to be said as the grieving is still taking place for many of those Vietnam veterans. There is no excuse at all for treating our returned servicemen and, indeed, some women that way. After all, they were the ones who were called to put their lives on the line when their country needed it. Their dedication and their commitment to service must be honoured. They dedicated themselves to the service of this country, no matter how they were recruited to Vietnam—many were national servicemen who were drafted into it. But regardless of how they came to be in the war, they did service in the interest of the Australian nation and they discharged their duty with all due valour and honour.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is something that does sit very solidly in the Australian psyche. You do not have to attend many Vietnam veteran occasions to see this. It is not only the pride of the returned servicemen you see there. I see it, and no doubt the member for Macarthur and all the other members present know that you actually see it, in the school children who are now turning up as they learn about our commitment. It is quite clear that this is the day we not only the commemorate the battle at Long Tan, but also the day we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War. The

                 stands equally proudly in Australian military history with Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. These are things that young school children now learn, and rightfully so, because they are things that they should be proud to know. It was an engagement against all the odds, where Australians were called upon to engage an enemy in what was probably a very much unforseen battle under very, very difficult circumstances. Long Tan was the first major engagement in Vietnam in which Australian troops were involved. This battle was the stuff that, quite frankly, legends were made of. Once again, Australian soldiers found themselves in a position where only their sheer bravery and their determination allowed them to stand against the odds. You draw lines of similarity with all those other theatres, such as Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. We should recall that

                 encountered a far superior force numerically as they fought in the rain, mud and mist of the rubber plantation that ran along the outside of the village of Long Tan. No-one could have reasonably expected that a force of 108 Australians, mostly young

                 men, led by a few regulars, with the support of artillery, including some Australian and New Zealand artillery as it turned out, could have held off a force the equivalent of almost two battalions. It comprised over 2,000

                 guerrillas. There was wave after wave of enemy attack on the Australian position. During the few hours that this battle lasted, there were many acts of bravery and mateship which have come to typify Australian involvement in war. To put it realistically, it is the Anzac spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For three hours they fought in the rain, with nothing more than a few plantation rubber trees and the mist generated by the rain for cover. They were waiting all that time for reinforcements to arrive. In the Anzac tradition, as I said, these Australians were supported by both Australian and New Zealand artillery. Sadly, lives on both sides were lost that day. By the end of the battle, 18 Australians had lost their lives and another 24 had been wounded. It is interesting that the oldest Australian casualty on that occasion was a 22-year-old and the youngest was a 19-year-old. That puts it in context when you think about your own kids. The other side, I understand, lost in excess of 250, with another 500 wounded.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As I mentioned at the outset, despite the significance of the Long Tan Battle, its commemoration is not simply of the battle itself but of all Vietnam veterans. It is about the nearly 500,000 who served in Vietnam, it is about the soldiers and it is about the families of the 500 Australian troops who lost their lives in service to their country. It is also about the 3,000 who were wounded during the conflict. Everyone who served in the Vietnam conflict deserves proper recognition and the full respect of the Australian people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We always need to be mindful of the fact that, even though the last of our troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1972, it was not until October 1987 that Australia officially held ceremonies to recognise the homecoming of our Vietnam veterans. Vietnam veterans throughout Australia continue to suffer and are haunted by the ghosts of their involvement in the war. It is an important part of Australian history and should be given that status. I hope that no group of Australian veterans is ever treated in the way that we treated our Vietnam heroes on their homecoming. That is a wrong that we need to right.

                 As the member for Fowler, I now have the honour of representing one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam itself. As a consequence of that, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War takes on a special significance. On 30 April this year, I attended a ceremony in Canberra to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the fall of Saigon to remember not only the Australians soldiers but also the many thousands of Vietnamese soldiers who died fighting for freedom and democracy. I had the opportunity to speak about the fall of Saigon to the communist forces and about what had occurred to the nation subsequent to that—for instance, the imprisonment of various Vietnamese people for essentially trying to exercise their own fundamental human rights—the human rights that Australians,

                 </a>
                 s and Americans were there supporting and trying to protect at the time of the Vietnamese conflict. At the time of the commemoration ceremonies of the fall of Saigon, I was advised of a march that was being planned by members of the Australian

                 and former Viet Cong soldiers. I reminded the crowd on that day that unlike the First and

                  Second World War
                 </a>
                 s there was no repatriation for Vietnamese refugees. At the conclusion of the Vietnam war the communist government reacted quite cruelly to any of those it suspected of having stood up against it or assisted in efforts against the communist insurgency, to the point that people were placed in very inhumane concentration camps or, as they are colloquially referred to, re-education camps. The communist government's actions forced millions of Vietnamese to flee their country, many in boats. They would have been, from Australia's point of view, the first boat people. Regrettably, many hundreds of thousands of people did not survive that journey.

                <p>
                 I am deeply concerned at human rights in Vietnam—it is something I have spoken of on many occasions in this parliament—because not only is it a continuation of past abuses of one's rights but also Australia, with its allies, fought in Vietnam to support and to protect the basic issues of freedom and democracy. Regrettably, these days people are accused of crimes such as supporting political groups not recognised by the state, criticising government policies, calling for democracy, even being interviewed by foreign journalists. Those matters are enough to subject you to a trial and, if found guilty, you are imprisoned. Our troops fought with distinction and with valour but they fought for Australia's interests to protect people from the insurgency of a communist regime. As a consequence they fought to protect those basic rights that we in our nation can freely enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Whilst I applaud every effort towards world peace and harmony, I believe, as I indicated on that day, that a parade by former Australian diggers who served in the Vietnam conflict alongside former Viet Cong guerrillas will send a very wrong message throughout our region. There has been a significant number of recorded abuses of human rights, continuing to this day, including more than 400 people incarcerated for trying to exercise their fundamental human rights. A parade will effectively say that you can continue to deny people their freedom and democracy whilst enjoying the support of a country such as Australia.

They have been busy fundraising to ensure that the comradeship memorial stands with pride of place because they want to demonstrate in Australia how proud they are of people which o made the sacrifice on their behalf. The comradeship memorial commemorates the friendship and sacrifice shared between Australian and Vietnamese soldiers. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the organising committee, among them Tri Vo, the project coordinator for the upgrade of the comradeship memorial, the presidents of the respective RSL clubs and the many Australian and Vietnamese war veterans who attend.

                 is not going to be something we simply condemn to the history books; it is something that we will commemorate on the basis that it is a true example of the Anzac spirit. It is a defining moment not only in Australian military history but for the spirit of Australia itself. The 18th of August is a very significant day in Australia's national calendar. We commemorate and acknowledge the efforts, bravery, courage and commitment of all of those who fought for this country, whether they were regular soldiers or members of the national service. We should ensure that we speak about this each year in commemoration of Long Tan. Lest we forget.

                  What marvellous recognition it would have been if my Vietnam veterans could have been here in this parliament in the last hour or so and heard the heartfelt addresses from the members for Macarthur, Fowler and Eden-Monaro. I could not even contemplate entering into the feelings that they have for their communities, especially the Vietnam vets community, but I am sure that if my Vietnam vets were here they would know that there are members in this place who remember what they did, determinedly work for their betterment through this parliament and their communities and do it with a passion and an understanding that they probably do not believe exists in this House. I want to commend them for that in the first instance and say, 'I recognise you.' As the member for Macarthur pointed out, when you have direct family pain such as he has been prepared to volunteer to the records of this parliament and you come into this place, it is great recognition not just for your father but for all the Vietnam vets who have felt alienated from the communities that they left to go to Vietnam and then returned to in difficult circumstances.

                   Yesterday there were many, many beautiful motorbikes. There were also a lot of fractured men and families. They were supported by

                   Motorcycle Club chapter in Gippsland. I can only enter in but cannot understand how their fractured lives have affected all of them over those years and how they congregate around Harley-Davidsons. It is a lovely way to be, because they are with their own. They are in their comfort zone. Yesterday you would have been proud of every one of them, including Russell Oakes —'T Rat', as I have to call him—who was a president of the club. They had organised around their memorial and around their clubhouse there at the old Longwarry Hall, which they had made into a fantastic clubhouse. They had organised a whole ceremony to remember Vietnam
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day" rel="nofollow">
                    Veterans Day
                   </a>
                   and the Long Tan remembrance. In that, probably the most heartbreaking moment was when the words of the song
                   <i>
                    I Was Only 19
                   </i>
                   were not sung but just read out as a poem. There were many tears that flowed in those few moments as that was read out. The sun was shining on a most glorious day in Gippsland—unusual with the wet we have had. So you can imagine the sparkling motorcycles surrounding this whole place. Not all the Vietnam veterans there came on motorbikes, you know; some came in cars. There were people like me, hangers on, that came along to the commemoration with them. But you felt a quiet comfort in the place as they remembered those fallen and as they remembered their mates who have fallen since and who have not made it into what we call old age—and there was a lot of grey hair yesterday; I think the boys would forgive me for saying that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So I want to recognise one—not only the boys who were there yesterday at Longwarry but all the support that they have had around them from their loved ones that support them in what they do; all of the people that went away with them to support them and that were part of that conflict; and the Defence Force support that came from this nation for them. That probably has not been recognised either, but they know who helped them. I will come to a plea in a moment, but I will just say this to you: yesterday, as a member of parliament, you would have been proud to stand amongst those men at the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club commemorations at Longwarry. It was a place where any member of this House would have been pleased to be standing. I know the former minister knows all about what I am talking about because he was the minister when much of these funds that were provided to this group were extended, allowing them to rebuild what they have done there at the moment. There is a bit of controversy right now over some money that is not going out to veterans in regard to welfare. I have raised that with the new minister and we are doing the best we possibly can. I admit that Victoria has had generous payments in regard to the welfare of veterans and that there has been a pull back. But I have a different set-up in Gippsland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There are welfare agencies quite close to each other across parts of Australia and they may be duplicating services. Government always has a right to question its own expenditure—there is no doubt about that. However,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
                    South Gippsland
                   </a>
                   has one service only and it goes from Wonthaggi all the way through the bottom country to
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Creek" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   , the Foster area, then right up to Korumburra and Leongatha—one service. I have been told there are some transitional funds, so I think in the process we can work through that for those transitional funds. In the north of my electorate, I do not have the same issue because there are welfare support groups for veterans all the way through. I think we will get a good outcome from the government on that. I have been in this parliament through a number of administrations and there has not been one administration in this place, from Hawke to Gillard, that I have been a part of that was not totally and absolutely supportive of the welfare of veterans, to the best of the government's financial ability. There has not been one Prime Minister who has not been in support of veterans, as best they possibly could in the financial straits of the government of the time. If we have failed veterans, we will take responsibility for that and endeavour in the processes into the future to support veterans and support them well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Vietnam Veterans Day was a great celebration. I congratulate all at Longwarry. I congratulate all who played a part in its presentation. But the moment of excitement came when one training aeroplane from the Roulettes came straight out of the sunlight towards the clubhouse, twisting and turning and throwing itself up into the air to a complete stall, then dropping towards the clubhouse again, circling three times, rolling and then flinging itself back to sail—a fitting tribute that is only given to very special occasions.

                    , and to remember all those who fought and those who died, and those who suffered as a result of our involvement in the Vietnam War. In the process, I will mention some of the people I have met in my time in this place, both as shadow minister and subsequently as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, where I have had the honour and the privilege to work with many members of the Vietnam veterans community.

                   <p>
                    Many speakers have spoken about the Battle of Long Tan and the nature of what occurred on that occasion, the tremendous courage and bravery of all those who fought as part of that engagement and who safeguarded the very real threat to the Australian base at

                    , recently established, and the nature of the struggle that occurred subsequent to that time around the question of honours and recognition. I will not go into the detail of that other than to make a couple of comments about several of the individuals that were involved, to highlight those individuals as examples of the very fine men who fought on that occasion—and recognising them as representative takes nothing away from others whom I do not mention. I will then talk a bit more about some other broader points with respect to our involvement in the Vietnam War. I note the presence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs prior to me, the honourable member for Dunkley.

                     Harry Smith
                    </a>
                    . Harry is someone who I have had a lot to do with over the years, as I know the member for Dunkley had, in what was for government a very difficult issue to deal with: the question of how to deal with recognition with respect to events long ago when we were but very young lads and when, it is acknowledged on all sides, things did not turn out the way they should have in terms of acknowledging the great courage and sacrifice that occurred.

                   <p>
                    Harry is an amazing bloke. He is as tough as nails, as hard as they come. There were times, it is fair to say—and I am prepared to say it now that I am not minister—he was bloody unreasonable. But, if I were ever in the dire situation that D Company was in, with its support units at that time, in that awful rank jungle, in that terrible driving rain, facing such a numerically superior force, I would have wanted someone like Harry Smith there to help me maintain what I needed to do in the circumstances. I have no doubt—from dealing with him over the years with respect to the outstanding matters which relate to acknowledging his men for what they did—that he is a man of enormous conviction, enormous courage and the sort of guts that a lot of people in this place, me included, can only dream about.

                    Harry remains committed to continuing to focus on and fight for recognition for a number of his men who he feels have not been recognised. I welcome the recent granting of the unit citation as long overdue recognition. It took a long time to get to the stage of being able to have the presentation. There were certainly issues around that, but I will not go to that today. I know from speaking to Harry very recently that those other issues remain outstanding and he remains concerned with aspects of the decisions taken at the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. I think there are issues around the operation of the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. Several issues have come before it where there have been legitimate concerns raised. I think it has an incredibly complex role to play dealing with outstanding matters of recognition, but I think it is also time for that tribunal to be reviewed. It has been in operation for long enough for that to occur, and it would be a positive step forward to ensure that a tribunal which does, by and large, a very good and important job is meeting the requirements that the government had when it was established.

                    I also mention Captain Morrie Stanley, who, as other speakers have mentioned, recently passed away. Then Captain Morrie Stanley was the forward artillery observer attached to the artillery, a Kiwi and a man who directed some 61 artillery fire missions into the site over 3½ hours in the most desperate times and the most appalling conditions. Morrie was able to be granted the unit citation in the time before his passing. Morrie Stanley was a modern epitome of the great linkage between

                    that dates back to the time of Gallipoli and he was a man that was enormously respected by those he worked with. No doubt, given the work he did at that time, his professionalism, his dedication and his skill saved many Australian lives. One other person I would mention in passing—again, someone who would be known to the former minister—is Lieutenant Adrian Roberts, who was in charge of the

                    s that arrived in support of D Company. Adrian is one of the people whose individual acts of valour I do not believe have been sufficiently recognised. He came back a man suffering from the circumstances of his service but, always dedicated to helping others, he became involved in the

                    I recently came back from Afghanistan. I was talking to a bunch of young blokes at

He was in fact Adrian's grandson serving in a very similar unit and therefore following on a great tradition. He is a young bloke whom I am sure Adrian is very proud of, and I believe Adrian has every right to be incredibly proud of him.

                    But it was not just Long Tan. This was a day to recognise the tremendous courage, sacrifice and service of the more than 60,000 who served in Vietnam and the region throughout the conflict. It is a time to recognise that it was not just the Army; it was also the

                    </a>
                    and it was also the Navy. It is a time to recognise that, although more than 500 died and more than 2,400 were wounded, many others have returned and have suffered from their service. It is a time to acknowledge that service. It is a time to recognise that these men did what they were asked to do on behalf of the governments of the day and many suffered in silence for years afterwards. It is important to recognise that at that time it was a difficult situation in Australian society in dealing with the issues of that conflict—partly, in my view, because it was in effect the first

                    war. In those circumstances, the issues we deal with today, with the sorts of reporting that we now almost take for granted, were in fact incredibly new at that time. We were not used to seeing the sorts of scenes that were coming across our TV screens on a nightly basis. We as a society, and frankly our political leaders, were not able to understand at the time or reflect properly on the reality of that and what it meant for a society dealing with the circumstances around a conflict of that nature. I think that that impacted on those who went, their families at home and the broader community and we did a disservice, as a nation, to those who returned in those circumstances.

                    But rather than focus on that I would like to focus on some aspects of what has happened since then that really highlight the great courage and camaraderie of many of those who went. I will briefly speak about a particular group of individuals who served in the Vietnam War who were also very familiar to the former minister, those around Operation Aussies Home. People like Jim Bourke and Peter Aylett, who never forgot that there were some six individuals who were missing in action subsequent to our involvement in that war; people who remembered that and never forgot; people who have dedicated in recent years a lot of their time, money and efforts to doing all they could to bring those men home. The work that they did has been acknowledged in this place before, but I am very pleased to acknowledge it again today. Jim and Peter in particular are two of that group whom I know reasonably well. Again, they are tough old so-and-sos. They are as gutsy as they come—dry and funny when they want to be and determined and tough when they have to be. It has been a great privilege for me to have known them over these years and to have worked with them. And I am sure that the former minister, the member for Dunkley, would share those sentiments. The work that they did ensured that the Defence Force followed on from that in a manner which ensured that the remains of those brave servicemen, the last of our remains from Vietnam, were returned home over a number of occasions, starting in effect with Parker and Gillson, under the time of the member for Dunkley as minister, through, in my time, to

                    </a>
                    , and then on to Herbert and Carver, the last two who were returned home. Jim Bourke is now working on getting a PhD at a university in Melbourne. I now call him professor and he is now looking at the very issue of what this means in respect of what occurred at the time and also what it means about the efforts to understand remembrance and the work that was done to return these men home. I think his work and the work of those like Peter Aylett with him is in fact work that we can all be very, very proud of.
