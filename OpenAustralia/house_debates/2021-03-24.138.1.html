        Today I pay tribute to the individuals working tirelessly to enhance the Inland Rail upgrades in our electorate of Indi—those fighting hard to make sure that decision-makers think bigger and see the potential in this project. Country people see all too often what happens when people making decisions that affect us do not understand us—do not understand our needs or understand what we are capable of. But not this time; not with us and not with Inland Rail.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deputy Prime Minister saw this when I brought him to Indi last week. I want to recognise some of the people leading this visionary community movement. The thing about Indi is that we don't sit back and wait for someone else to solve the problem. We get busy; we show up. More than 200 people showed up last Friday.

       <p>
        In Euroa: Jim Shovelton, the spokesperson of Euroa Connect, who presented to the

        In Wangaratta: David Maroney and his team, who volunteer tirelessly to improve the safety and functioning of the Wangaratta Railway Station Precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a community Independent, I am proud to walk alongside these people as their representative in this place. I call upon the government to honour their passion, their talent, their incredible skills and their commitment to a better future for our region, with assurances that the Inland Rail upgrade will deliver what the community wants.
