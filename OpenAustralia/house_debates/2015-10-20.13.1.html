        I rise today to highlight the exceptionally talented Louise Adams. Louise has made it through to the final eight in this year's

        and spent her formative years in the Barossa, another beautiful region within Barker. Fortunately I had the pleasure of working, albeit for a brief period, alongside Louise during my time as a solicitor with Ryan's Lawyers in Mount Gambier. Louise is married to her loving husband, Andrew, and is mother to a beautiful one-year old daughter, Frankie. Her Parents in law, Peter and Taffy Burchell, are long-term small business operators in Mount Gambier, whose commitment to the community is well recognised.

        Her success in music is a relatively recent development in her life as Louise did not sing in front of an audience until she was in her mid-twenties. Louise is an excellent example of the talent spread throughout rural and regional Australia and especially within my electorate of Barker. What a pleasure it is to see her achieving at such a high level, with millions of Australians captivated by her weekly performances broadcast into their living rooms. Louise's experience is testament to the importance of backing yourself and having a go. It is great to see her going from strength to strength in the competition, and I hope her experience inspires others to do the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge people across the nation, but particularly within my electorate of Barker, to support Louise and vote for her. As they say, vote early and vote often. I am confident Louise can go all the way and win
