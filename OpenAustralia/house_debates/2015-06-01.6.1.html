         <p>
          Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Australian Commission for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
           Law Enforcement
          </a>
          Integrity, ACLEI, is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious and systemic corruption issues in Australia's law enforcement agencies. ACLEI is required, pursuant to the Law Enforcement Integrity Act, to provide an annual report to the parliament detailing its activities and investigations.
         </p>
         <p>
          The annual report notes in detail the expanded jurisdiction of ACLEI. While ACLEI's original jurisdiction included the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Crime Commission
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Customs
          </a>
          and Border Protection Service and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Federal Police
          </a>
          , it has been expanded to include the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Transaction_Reports_and_Analysis_Centre" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimTrac" rel="nofollow">
           CrimTrac

          and biosecurity staff within the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Agriculture
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          While the committee is concurrently inquiring into ACLEI's expanded jurisdiction, the annual report helpfully notes the challenges that the expanded jurisdiction poses to ACLEI.
         </p>
         <p>
          The annual report notes the upcoming merger of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service into the Australian Border Force, and that will be a high priority for ACLEI in coming years.
         </p>
         <p>
          The annual report discusses the usefulness for ACLEI of its Sydney based task force, and is pleased to date with its results. The committee will continue to monitor ACLEI's work and expanded jurisdiction with close interest.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee notes that ACLEI's budget in 2013-14 was increased from $6.0 million to $7.6 million, and had an operating surplus of $0.8 million, due to ongoing difficulties in filling temporary vacancies.
         </p>
         <p>
          The annual report also details some of ACLEI's effective operations, including Operation Heritage/Marca.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee notes comments raised by the former acting Integrity Commissioner, Mr Robert Cornall, relating to the significant leadership changes across both ACLEI and the majority of its partner agencies.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee agrees with the assessment of ACLEI officers that corruption enabled border crime remains a significant law enforcement integrity issue. It was with this fact in mind that the committee composed the terms of reference for its new inquiry into the integrity of Australia's border arrangements.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee notes that while ACLEI has largely met its
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">
           KPI
          </a>
          s in 2013-14, there has been some slippage in its performance on some measures. The committee notes the expanded jurisdiction and lack of suitable staff have prevented ACLEI from meeting its KPIs that relate to assessing notifications and referrals.
         </p>
         <p>
          The committee also notes that there are large numbers of unresolved internal partner agency investigations/ from 2013-14 and 2012-13 and will seek a clearer explanation of the internal investigations completed and underway, and the reasons for significant delays. Similarly, the committee will seek an explanation from ACLEI as to the number of ongoing corruption issues carried over from the previous financial year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also, the committee congratulates the Integrity Commissioner and ACLEI officers for the quality and readability of the 2013-14 annual report and for their cooperation and engagement during the inquiry. The committee also thanks Mr Cornall for his work as acting Integrity Commissioner and congratulates Mr Michael Griffin on his appointment as Integrity Commissioner.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lastly, I would like to thank the secretary of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and Integrity, Stephen Palethorpe, as well as senior research officer Josh See and his colleagues at the Senate committee office for their hard work and support, along with all the members of the committee for their valued and ongoing contribution.
         </p>
