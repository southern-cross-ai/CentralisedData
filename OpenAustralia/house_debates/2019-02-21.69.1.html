       <p>
        We are well and truly into the third season of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        Women's football league, and I want to congratulate two young women from my electorate and the South-West of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        who are making up the ranks of this exciting competition. Katie-Jayne Grieve and Philipa Seth are currently playing for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Dockers" rel="nofollow">
         Fremantle Dockers
        </a>
        women's team, which is currently undefeated in this year's competition. It's Philipa's first year after being drafted from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         East Fremantle
        </a>
        , while Katie-Jayne played for Carlton last season before heading back to WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Katie-Jayne started her football career with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bunbury_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         South Bunbury Football Club
        </a>
        , and Philipa recently played with and was an assistant coach of the Collie Eagles Football Club. Both of these teams play in the fantastic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         South West Football League
        </a>
        , which is one of the first leagues in Australia to field women sides and now has eight teams in the competition, including my local Harvey Bulls Football Club women's team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Katie-Jayne and Philipa are role models and an inspiration for young women currently preparing for this year's South West Football League. They are also an inspiration to the thousands of young girls and women across Australia who dream of representing their club in the AFL, people like myself, who have only been able to watch it for so many years. I look forward to the inclusion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        , who will field a women's team next season. It should have been this season, AFL. I wish Katie-Jayne, Philipa and all of the women who are playing AFL good luck this season.
