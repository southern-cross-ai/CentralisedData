        For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 124th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly to Panama and bilateral visit to Brazil of 4 to 23 April 2011. In tabling the report, I indicate that this was yet another hardworking and informative delegation. Time does not permit me to provide you with a detailed overview of the delegation's contribution to the 124th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        Assembly. I commend to honourable members the preface of the report, which outlines the highlights of the delegation's work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's delegations to assemblies of the Inter-Parliamentary Union have established a reputation for making a significant contribution to the IPU through their hard work, often behind the scenes, to facilitate dialogue and broker agreements across a wide range of global issues. The high regard in which Australia is held within the IPU is reflected in the invitation for an Australian representative to serve for the first time as a member of the Advisory Group to the IPU Committee on United Nations Affairs. The member for Holt,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Byrne
        </a>
        , was appointed to the advisory committee and represented Australia at the advisory committee's deliberations in Panama.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia served in key roles on two drafting committees: the member for Lyons,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Adams" rel="nofollow">
         Dick Adams
        </a>
        , was appointed chair of the drafting committee of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development" rel="nofollow">
         Sustainable Development
        </a>
        , Finance and Trade, and demonstrated Australia's leadership credentials by steering that committee through 128 amendments to a unanimous resolution in record time. I was appointed rapporteur of the drafting committee for the emergency item titled 'Strengthening democratic reform in emerging democracies including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         North Africa
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        '. That resolution was also adopted unanimously by the assembly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bilateral visit to Brazil prior to the IPU assembly was highly educative. The commonalities between our two countries are many, and are underscored by a warm and positive bilateral relationship. Every member of the delegation came away from the visit with a strong appreciation of the tremendous opportunities for Australian business in Brazil across a range of sectors including resources, clean energy, infrastructure, education and the organisation of major sporting events. The clear message was that Australia must continue to strive to improve the shared understanding between us so that we can realise the full potential of these opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, Australia has much to gain by continuing to develop the positive relationship it shares with Panama. Ambassador Katrina Cooper must be congratulated for seizing the opportunity of the IPU assembly in Panama to announce the appointment of Australia's first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Consul" rel="nofollow">
         Honorary Consul
        </a>
        to Panama, Mr Ricardo Alberto Martinelli. Mr Martinelli embodies the key to strengthening the Panama-Australia relationship. He has studied and travelled in Australia and his firsthand appreciation of Australia and Australians will make him a very effective honorary consul for Australia. In addition, he is the son of Panama's President,

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the many people who contributed to the success of the delegation's visits. Foremost amongst these were Ambassador Brett Hackett and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        staff in Brazil, including in Brasilia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo" rel="nofollow">
         Sao Paulo
        </a>
        , and Ambassador Katrina Cooper and her staff who came down to Panama from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City" rel="nofollow">
         Mexico City
        </a>
        , who put together outstanding programs and provided practical support to the delegation.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the delegation I thank Mr Eric van der Wal, the delegation's foreign affairs adviser at the IPU assembly in Panama, for his advice and professional support at this and previous IPU assemblies. I also thank the Delegation Secretary, Ms Jeannette Radcliffe, for her assistance and support to the delegation. And I thank my adviser, Debra Biggs, for her support to me personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I congratulate my fellow delegates for their hard work and good humour throughout this highly successful series of visits. Particular mention must be made of my deputy on this and previous delegations, Senator Judith Troeth, who has recently retired. I take this opportunity to acknowledge her significant contribution to the work of the IPU over successive assemblies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the House for its attention and I commend the report to the House.
