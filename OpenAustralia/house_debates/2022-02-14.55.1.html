        I have been contacted recently by many Qantas long-haul flight attendants who are deeply concerned by Qantas management's application to the Fair Work Commission to cancel or terminate their enterprise bargaining agreement. This will result in huge reductions in income and conditions for loyal Qantas staff. These workers feel let down by Qantas after they stood by the airline through the most difficult period of its existence. They had long periods where they were stood down and had to get other jobs. Many of them risked their health and safety on repatriation flights long before a vaccine was ever developed. They have been in isolation after simply going to work. Many of them had to go into two weeks isolation just after undertaking flights. They have gone above and beyond. Yet, after only a few months of negotiations between Qantas and the

        , Qantas are off to the Fair Work Commission to try and cancel the enterprise bargaining agreement.

        I've spoken to both parties, and it's evident that they're not too far apart in reaching an agreement. Qantas received over $1 billion worth of taxpayer support during this pandemic to get them through, and I believe it's incumbent upon them to treat their staff fairly, come back to the negotiating table and seek to nut out an agreement with their loyal staff. They have, unfortunately, got form with this. They recently sacked their ramp staff and baggage handlers, and it was found to be illegal by the Federal Court. Let's hope they don't go down that path once again. Qantas, don't use this pandemic as an opportunity to try and smash the union. Get back to the negotiating table.
