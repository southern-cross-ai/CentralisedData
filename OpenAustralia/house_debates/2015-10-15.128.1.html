        I rise to pay tribute to the many men and women involved with Legacy in Australia, and in particularly on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . It was a privilege to attend this year's launch of Legacy's badge week, which was hosted by Brisbane Water Legacy. Every year Legacy raises funds by selling badges in the first week of September. Legacy in Australia was established some 90 years ago, and in 2015 provides support for almost 90,000 war widows and dependents. The assistance of 50 Legacy clubs, supported by 5,300 volunteers, is of course vital for caring for war widows and dependents. Legacy is one of the oldest and most well-regarded charities, operating in accordance with its original mission: to care for the families of those who served our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Central Coast, my electorate is served by Brisbane Water Legacy. This club is supported by 63 legatees, all of whom are volunteers. Operating since 1950, Brisbane Water Legacy currently provides welfare programs for 2,050 war widows and 53 dependents. In 2014-15, Legacy on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Central Coast
        </a>
        funded $915,000 worth of support services for their beneficiaries. Funding for these services is provided from donations, bequests, income from investments and the operation of a retirement village. Many people will be familiar with the services provided by Legacy; however, most would be unaware of the extent of the services provided across the Central Coast. Legacy provides financial assistance by way of payment for medical and health services for widows who do not qualify for health support payments. Further financial assistance can also take the form of reimbursement of travel costs to attend medical appointments in addition to payment of school sports and activities for students whose parents have given their lives in ADF activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        To help combat social isolation for widows, Brisbane Water Legacy also provides a well-established social club program in five locations across the Central Coast. This program sees the groups meet fortnightly to provide social interaction and support for widows. Gatherings for widows at events such as Christmas,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Mother's Day
        </a>
        and Christmas in July are provided, as well as gatherings at significant milestones such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Centenary of Anzac commemorations.
       </p>
       <p>
        While all the programs provided by Legacy are hugely beneficial on the Central Coast, one major initiative is particularly advantageous. Brisbane Water Legacy provides an annual scholarship for students who reside in the region and who have a link to ADF members past or present. The scholarship is administered through the Australian Veterans' Children Assistance Trust Ltd and is provided to three students for four years. Since its inaugural year in 2002, 30 students have benefited from this program, with over $305,000 provided from the Brisbane Water Legacy fund. I commend Brisbane Water Legacy for their services to the Central Coast veterans' community.
