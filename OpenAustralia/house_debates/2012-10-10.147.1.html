        I am very pleased today to rise to speak about some major infrastructure in my electorate. I wish to speak specifically about some of the upgrades to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        and the federal Labor government's massive commitment to this upgrade on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        and what it means for locals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will start with the official opening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banora_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Banora Point
        </a>
        upgrade at Sextons Hill, which is just over the border. On Saturday, 22 September, we had the official opening of this major upgrade. I was very pleased that Minister Anthony Albanese was able to attend and open this fantastic upgrade. Having the Pacific Highway upgraded at Sextons Hill makes a big difference. It means much faster travelling time for locals and of course it means greater safety. I have had a very strong commitment to having this upgrade completed, firstly, as a long-term local and, secondly, as a former police officer. I have a very strong commitment to making sure we have greater roads in the area.
       </p>

        The federal Labor government delivered the funding for this as part of their economic stimulus package and I was pleased to announce that in 2008. The total project we delivered cost $359 million. The federal Labor government delivered $349 million and the previous state government committed $10 million towards this major project. The opening of the Sextons Hill upgrade means you can leave the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane CBD
        </a>
        and not hit any traffic lights until
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        now. What a big difference that makes for many people travelling through the North Coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . It was a great day for locals. Many in the community have lobbied very hard to have this upgrade occur. As a local MP I was very proud to deliver the funding and even prouder on the official opening on the 22nd to see it finished and to see how please locals were to finally have this community victory completed.

        On Friday, 28 September we turned the sod on the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale Pacific Highway upgrade at Bangalow. This project will cost $862 million of which the federal Labor government has delivered $566 million. This is the largest single infrastructure investment ever in the Richmond electorate. The Tintenbar to Ewingsdale Pacific Highway upgrade will be 17.3 kilometres of four-lane divided road. It is going to make a major difference to this whole area to have this upgrade completed. We have had a number of very serious and some fatal traffic accidents there over the years, so it will make a big difference to have this upgrade completed. Not only will it reduce travelling times but, first and foremost, it will be safer as well. As I said, it is the biggest single infrastructure investment in my electorate, so I am very proud to be updating the House on these two major commitments upgrading the Pacific Highway in New South Wales. Both of these are major commitments from the federal Labor government in improving safety for locals and also for people travelling through our area.
