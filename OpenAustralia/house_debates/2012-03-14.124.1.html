        We all know the fundamental importance of sport to the health and wellbeing of a community, and one of Australia's most popular sports is tennis. In October last year I was honoured to attend the Tennis Queensland awards evening. It was no surprise that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Stosur" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Ashleigh Barty won awards for their outstanding achievements. However, I was delighted that the Gap Health and Racquet Club was recognised for its hard work and dedication with two awards. The club itself won Most Outstanding Club award and one of their coaches, Mr Danial Stredder, won the Coaching Excellence award for the

        program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gap club caters for more than 600 children in their coaching academy as well as in their local schools and continues to go from strength to strength. I know that Danial in particular has worked very hard to arrange the Inter-Schools Tennis Cup, a round robin Hot Shots event for primary schoolchildren. With Danial's support, I am sure we will have a future

        to launch Hot Shots in Canberra. MLC Tennis Hot Shots was developed by coaching professionals and is Tennis Australia's official starter program for children aged between five and 10. Through the Hot Shots campaign children learn to play on the right-sized court, using racquets that are perfect for small hands and balls that do not bounce too high. Tennis Hot Shots has now expanded to over 1,000 venues across Australia to include more than 248,000 Australian childrenâ€”even more than the

        I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Tennis Queensland on the success of this year's

        Premier Tournament, one of only 22 in the world, and now the first Premier event on the tennis calendar. This tournament smashed all previous attendance records, with 92,802 patrons passing through the gates. No doubt this was due in part to the high level of leading tennis players who participated in the tournament along with our own local heroes,

        and Ashleigh Barty, to name just a few. But, as the saying goes, that's not all. Due to the recent success of our Australian Davis Cup team, Brisbane will be hosting the next challenge against Korea in April this year. I look forward to seeing Bernard Tomic in action again as he continues his determined rise up the ranks.

        Tennis is one of those wonderful sports you can play throughout your life and you do not need to be a champion to enjoy the game. Tennis Australia is also undertaking significant community work in regional Australia, for which they should be commended. Earlier in March, Australian tennis legend

        Under the stewardship of President Stephen Healy and the Tennis Australia Board, with CEO Steve Wood and Ken Laffey,
