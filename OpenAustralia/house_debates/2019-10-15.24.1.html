        Half the Australian population had a pathology test of some sort in the last 12 months. Pathology is crucial to the detection of disease, the treatment of chronic disease and often to split-second decisions that are needed in emergency departments. Australia has world-class pathology and a dedicated workforce of 35,000 skilled people—scientists, pathologists, lab technicians and phlebotomists—working each and every day and often overnight to provide a crucial service to our community.

        Yet most Australians don't have the opportunity to meet the pathologists and scientists responsible for their diagnosis or to see where they work. So I was lucky recently to be given a tour of the path lab at

        </a>
        , to be introduced to the fascinating work done by the doctors and scientists there, managing the life-saving blood bank and vital daily tests. Every single person I met at Frankston Hospital was dedicated to their work, proud of their contribution to better health for people who live in Dunkley and beyond, and so impressively smart. It was a privilege to meet them, particularly as I am someone who has benefited and continues to benefit from their work and that of their colleagues.

        I saw the examination of a section of bowel needed to provide information to treat bowel cancer. This month is breast cancer awareness month. Diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer crucially relies on path tests. Managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, prevalent in my electorate, relies on pathology tests. I pay credit to all the pathologists and allied health professionals around the country, and I urge members of parliament to visit their labs.
