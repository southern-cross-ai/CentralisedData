        I present the report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate, incorporating a report of the committee’s activities. Copies of the report are being placed on the table. I seek leave to move that the House agree to the report and to make a short statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        In May 2006 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        on Publications presented its report on the
        <i>
         Distribution of parliamentary papers series
        </i>
        . The committee’s report made 23 recommendations, of which nine related to electronic publication and options for developing an electronic parliamentary papers series. The committee’s recommendations were supported by both the Presiding Officers and the government. However, the significant costs in both capital and human resources and the possibility of these costs being duplicated in the parliament and across government were noted at the time as significant concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the technological and whole of government developments that have occurred since the committee’s report in 2006, the committee has this morning resolved to undertake a short inquiry on the development of an electronic parliamentary papers series. The committee will seek input from interested parties and will present its report to both houses on 24 June 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has also undertaken a review of compliance of departments and agencies with printing standards for the parliamentary papers series. That review indicates a general level of compliance. The main areas of noncompliance relate to the use of ‘bleeding’ and full colour printing. At its meeting this morning the committee resolved to continue to make departments and agencies aware of printing standards and to undertake a second compliance review later this year. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the report be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
