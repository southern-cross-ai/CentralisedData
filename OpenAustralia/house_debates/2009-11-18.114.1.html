        I rise today to talk about the important issue of lung disease in Australia. Lung disease is a significant and growing health issue in Australia and this month is Lung Health Awareness Month. Each year lung disease places a considerable burden on Australia’s hospital system, resulting in nearly 350,000 hospitalisations and, sadly, causing 19,000 deaths. According to the Australian Lung Foundation, during 2007-08 there were 617,000 cases of lung disease reported in Queensland, but many more remain undiagnosed. Only about 25 per cent of Australians with lung cancer are diagnosed early enough for curative surgery to be attempted. In addition, Australian research indicates that half of all those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes emphysema or chronic bronchitis, are unaware that they have the disease, even though it is advanced enough to already be affecting their quality of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than a third of Australians, 36 per cent, who have experienced one or more of these symptoms have never spoken to their doctor about their symptoms, which could be putting them at risk of serious illness or even death. Associate Professor Kwun Fong, physician at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        , Brisbane, explained that lung disease is a serious condition which many Australians may be at risk of developing, according to new research. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and many other lesser known conditions such as … pulmonary arterial hypertension are all serious lung conditions. Many lung diseases are caused by a history of smoking or exposure to dust, gas or fumes and in some instances genetics may also be a factor.
       </p>
       <p>
        To improve early diagnosis and encourage consumer awareness of lung disease symptoms, the Australian Lung Foundation recently launched a new lung health checklist, which is available online and was developed in consultation with leading respiratory clinicians. This educational tool encourages early diagnosis and allows people with respiratory symptoms to understand their lung health and effectively communicate with their doctor. It is imperative that, through such campaigns, the community is educated on the risks of inaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Lung Foundation is to be commended on its work in increasing awareness and highlighting the importance of education in relation to respiratory conditions. The flow-on effect across the health system would be considerable if Australians began to take the issue seriously. Dr Ian Yang from the Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane sums the situation up with great clarity. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is critical that Australians know what the symptoms of lung disease can be and act on their lung health, as this can make a real difference to quality of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree more with him and I congratulate the Australian Lung Foundation on its work.
