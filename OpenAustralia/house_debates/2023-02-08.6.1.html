       <p>
        I present the 2022 annual report on the implementation of the recommendations from the
        <i>
         Set the standard
        </i>
        report.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, I want to acknowledge and reiterate the
        <i>
         Set the standard
        </i>
        report findings—that an unacceptably high rate of people, particularly women, in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces experienced bullying, sexual harassment, or actual or attempted sexual assault whilst at work. This misconduct is unacceptable, and we acknowledge the grave impact it had or continues to have on previous and current staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we commend the progress this parliament has made, we note that there is still much more work to be done to achieve the goals we set 12 months ago. We want to uphold the highest standards of workplace behaviour in line with what is expected of us by the Australian public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the
        <i>
         Set the standard
        </i>
        report was adopted by this parliament one year ago, the composition of this parliament has changed. In the 2022 election, we saw the numbers of women increase, as well as the numbers of those parliamentarians elected as Independents without the support of a traditional political party.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes to the composition of parliament have no doubt brought its own cultural change. However, the report's findings remain as relevant as ever to all parliamentarians and their staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        The set the standard report provided a road map for the parliament to implement systemic and cultural changes in a range of areas to make
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces safe and respectful places to work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past 12 months, leaders from across the parliament and departments have responded to the report to progress the 28 recommendations. The
        <i>
         Set the standard
        </i>
        report categorised 28 recommendations by five outcomes:
       </p>
       <p>
        • leadership
       </p>
       <p>
        • diversity, equality and inclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        • systems to support performance
       </p>
       <p>
        • standards, reporting and accountability, and
       </p>
       <p>
        • safety and wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 28 recommendations, six have already been implemented, for have been partly implemented, and 17 are in-progress (noting many are ongoing measures).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implementing the 28 recommendations is a shared responsibility across Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces, including government, Presiding Officers, parliamentary departments, political parties, and parliamentarians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Change will come with the continuous commitment and goodwill of members and senators. Today we recommit ourselves with concerted effort and attention to the recommendations of the
        <i>
         Set the standard
        </i>
        review.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next 12 months we should see:
       </p>
       <p>
        • The expansion of the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service to be established as an independent statutory human resources entity providing advice and training to parliamentarians and staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        • The endorsement of codes of conduct for all Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        • The introduction of improved health and wellbeing services, including general practitioner services, pharmaceutical and mental health supports.
       </p>
       <p>
        • The consideration of amendments to standing orders and conventions to improve levels of safety and respect in the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        • The modernisation of the

       <p>
        I acknowledge the leadership and commitment of many people for the work completed to date, including the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, as well as the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other party leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nation is looking to this parliament to show leadership in this space, and the expectation is that we will deliver.
