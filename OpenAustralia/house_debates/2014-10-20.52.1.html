        Many members will know Kathryn Harveyson as one of the helpful, smiling faces in the Serjeant-at-Arms office, but members may not know that she is also part of a team of 28 Canberrans who have recently cycled more than 1,200 kilometres from Denmark to France, raising over $135,000 for the Kids' Cancer Project in the process. The team of cyclists was led by Danish Canberran Bjarne Kragh, and included: a firefighter, an ambulance officer, physiotherapists, public servants, a lawyer, a medical student and a medical doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the first year that an Australian team has taken part in this annual cycling challenge, which raises money for various children's cancer charities. Cyclists ride for at least seven days, averaging over 170 kilometres a day; cycling over slippery cobblestones and train tracks, and tackling rain, shine, storms and mountains along the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kids Cancer Project is an independent Australian charity, which funds world-leading research into childhood cancers. September was Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Tragically, Australia has one of the highest rates of childhood cancer in the world. Every year, 600 Australian children are diagnosed with cancer, and every week childhood cancer claims the lives of three Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The more than $135,000 the team raised for the Kids Cancer Project will go a long way to support critical childhood cancer research programs. Congratulations and thanks to Bjarne, Kathryn and the whole team for their dedication and great fundraising efforts. Canberra is very proud of you.
