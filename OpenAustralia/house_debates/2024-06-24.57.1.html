       <p>
        Today I rise to speak about a major concern for many of my constituents in recent years—the issue of juvenile crime. Today, though, I want to talk about the gold-standard early intervention that can prevent it. Every day we hear a news story about an armed robbery, burglary or stolen vehicle. The effects of

        youth crime have left locals frustrated, frightened and fed up.
       </p>
       <p>
        If there's one person that has cracked the code in helping these kids turn their lives around to reconnect positively with the community it's Joseph Te Puni-Fromont, the founder of Esuarve, in Pimpama—or Joe, as we like to call him. Last week, I had the great honour of visiting Esuarve, alongside my Gold Coast colleagues the member for Forde and the member for Moncrieff.

        and the team at Esuarve deliver a range of programs for troubled youth, providing them with valuable life skills, personal development, and education and employment pathways, all whilst giving them a sense of belonging within their Esuarve family.

        And it truly is a family. The mentors surround their participants with such genuine love and support, something many of these young people have never experienced before. I was so moved to see firsthand the way this program completely changes the direction of these young men and women's lives. Over 230 kids have come through this program, and, with the right support, I hope to see many more have this wonderful opportunity into the future to turn their lives around.
