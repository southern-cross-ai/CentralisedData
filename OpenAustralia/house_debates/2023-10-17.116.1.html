        I want to give a shout-out to a young legend from Jerrabomberra in my electorate who is following her dreams and inspiring her peers. Alyse

        and surrounding regions in the junior Indoor Cricket National Championships, which were held in Ipswich earlier this year. Alyse has just returned from Dubai, where the under-15 Australian team finished up with a bronze medal in the under-17s division. On top of that, she was also awarded player of the match against

She then played for an under-10s Queanbeyan District Cricket Club side, progressed through the age groups and won two premierships in the Queanbeyan District Cricket Club women's team. Congratulations, Alyse, on your budding cricket career. You're doing us all incredibly proud.

        I recently had the opportunity to visit a brand-new early intervention PlayAbility inclusion hub that has opened in Bega. The hub was founded through round 2 of the Bushfire Local Economic Recovery Fund, boosting fire affected communities and helping them to get back on their feet. The PlayAbility inclusion hub will provide specialised early intervention services for families who have kids from birth to school age with a disability or developmental delay in two or more areas. The hub will provide family support through their supported playgroups, mobile parenting support services and Indigenous family support programs. The space will provide accessible services and support for vulnerable families in the

        This week, I was invited to join Meals on Wheels Queanbeyan to celebrate their 70th anniversary, but unfortunately, as it's a sitting week, I can't get there. It is a much-loved food delivery service which helps thousands of people across the country and in my own electorate. We know that older people suffer from social exclusion. It's a national health and wellbeing issue. Big congratulations to all those volunteers from Meals on Wheels Queanbeyan. Recently, I was able to present them with a $2,000 volunteers grant. Thank you for the work that you do.

        In the last week, there has been a bushfire in my electorate again. I want to extend my sympathies to those impacted by the Coolagolite bushfire near Bermagui. It started in farmland and spread quickly over nearly 7,000 hectares, impacting areas of Cuttagee, Barragga Bay and the Murrah, destroying two homes, damaging two more and destroying 14 outbuildings. We know that the Bermagui sporting club sustained significant damage, along with a number of primary producers. The Prime Minister and I visited Bermagui the day after the fire to check on the community there. The overwhelming sentiment was one of sincere thanks.
