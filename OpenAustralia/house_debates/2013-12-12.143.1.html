       <p>
        Australia's ban on live exports was just one of the many policy failures by the former Labor government, but it is one that has had lasting effects on my electorate of Durack. This knee-jerk reaction from Labor has not only strained Australia's relationship with many of our export markets but has also had serious financial and emotional effects on our cattle producers and their families. The preservation of live exports is vital to Australia. With so few markets available, it is important for all Australians to fight for our farmers and for this vital export industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make no mistake, nobody, including our hardworking cattle producers, wants to see cruelty to animals. It is, however, the human welfare side of the live export debate that is of concern to me and my constituents. It is something that I believe needs to be brought to the forefront of all Australians' minds. In many anti-live export campaigners' haste to criticise this industry and in their minds stand up for the welfare of animals, they seem to have forgotten their own humanity and the welfare of their fellow man and woman. These cattle producers are not all big corporations; they are hardworking families who have been victimised by people who seem to have lost their way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anti-live export campaigners are now resorting to threats and intimidation tactics to send a message. They are threatening not only the lives of these producers, but their children as well. One of my constituents from Wannamal in Western Australia's wheat belt region has been sickened by the threats that his family and others have personally endured. Social media has been the weapon of choice to relay these threats and intimidations. Their ability to remain relatively anonymous and troll through various Facebook pages simply reinforces the term 'keyboard warrior', and is utterly appalling. On a 'save live export' Facebook page, a threat was recently made against my constituent's children and their primary school. A report has been made by both the school principal and my constituent to the police, and Facebook has been contacted. Unfortunately, these people have yet to be removed from Facebook. Months of multiple phone calls per day to this house and family have also been reported to police.
       </p>
       <p>
        These farmers do not deserve to have their livelihood taken from them, and are fearful that what may have been idle threats so far will turn into something less peaceful. In the words of this constituent: 'How far are these extremists allowed to go? How much must we as producers take and how long will this constant bombardment of attacks toward producers, our families and our businesses be allowed to continue? I dread to think of the possibilities.'
