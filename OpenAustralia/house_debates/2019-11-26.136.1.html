        I rise today to speak about two locals in my electorate, Mark and Anne-Louise Underwood from Redcliffe. This couple deserve huge congratulations for their innovative idea and creation of an app that is revolutionising the lives of people living with dementia and easing the burden of stress on their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their invention of the app MemBo Noticeboard was recently recognised as one of the top four inspirational tech ideas. It's helping to break down barriers for people living with dementia, their families and carers. The Australian government's Department of Health Decoding Dementia 2019 program recognises that the MemBo Noticeboard app is a useful tool in enabling people living with dementia to maintain social inclusion and independence, and it keeps them connected with the people and places in their community that they rely upon.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently spoke with Mark and Anne-Louise and congratulated them on their great work, the app, and what they're doing for people with dementia. During our catch-up, they told me about the app and what inspired them to come up with the great idea. The app was started when Anne-Louise's 90-year-old mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia and, all of a sudden, was unable to cope with day-to-day changes. With a background in medical admin software, Anne-Louise and Mark came up with a system to help make every day simpler for people living with dementia and their support teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        The app is basically a live noticeboard that is able to be displayed on a mobile and tablet and is updated and amended remotely by family and support services. MemBo Noticeboard acts as a living calendar for people living with dementia. For Anne-Louise's mum, the app has now replaced her wall calendar, whiteboard and diary, and Anne-Louise said it has made everyday life much simpler for her mother and, more importantly, has reduced stress for her and their entire family.
       </p>
       <p>
        'What about older people using tablets?' people may ask. Anne-Louise said that, with the tablet being set to 'live' 24/7, all that's required for her mum to use it is a moment's walk to where it is on the wall and her reading glasses. She doesn't have to touch anything and, because it's live all day and night, she can look at it as much as she wants, and it acts as a constant reminder whenever it's required.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing about the dramatic impact it has made on their lives, it's great to see that this has been recognised as an important tool that will help others in the future. I want to again give both Mark and Anne-Louise massive congratulations on the development of this great tool and, if anyone would like further information, visit the website: www.membonoticeboard.com.
