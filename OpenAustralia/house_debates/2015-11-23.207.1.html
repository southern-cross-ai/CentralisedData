I would also like to acknowledge South Grafton High School for giving the students this opportunityâ€”in particular, the school's dance teacher, Sarah McCann, and the Aboriginal support teacher, Wendy Dalton. The Maclean High School will feature at the spectacular with several of their students selected to perform in the combined schools choir.

The coach of the year went to Dallas Waters for his turn-around of the South Grafton Rebels, taking them to their first premiership in four decades, and that was a great game. Laura Moloney won the Australian under-13 girls squash championship in October last year, and she followed that impressive result in April this year when she won the under-15 title. This earned her the female junior sportsperson award. The male junior sportsperson of the year went to

        Wall of Fame Brent Livermore, formally of Grafton, was inducted for his dedication and success with Australian hockey team the Kookaburras. He was also the guest speaker and gave some wonderful insight and knowledge into how you can excel at your chosen sport. The second recipient was Harold Kratz. Harold is 88. He was inducted for his outstanding contribution to rowing. Harold has been an administrator, coach and competitor for many decades. As a competitor, he has been a medal winner at the masters events every year since 1994. Last year alone he won three gold medals in Adelaide. He is a life member of the Clarence Amateur Rowing and Sculling Club and the Combined High School Rowing. Congratulations to all those people.

To reach this level the students had to compete at school, the Zone carnival and the North Coast Regional Athletics before reaching the state athletics championships in Sydney. I congratulate all of them.

        It was a very momentous day for many people on Friday, 20 November in Lismore when a well-known business icon and local identity finally called it quits.

        , better known to many as Toby or the Woodlark Street 'Mayor', finally retired after 55 years in homewares. He was known to many for his friendly personality and great customer service, as well as his good quality manchester. John commenced work at 15 years of age in a business known as Glynns homewares, which later became McLeans. In 1989, along with his wife, Noeleen, he decided to take the plunge and start up his own business known as Daley's Homeware and Monogramming Specialists. The business commenced in the

        </a>
        and later moved to its current location in Woodlark Street. John's wife, Noeleen, retired from the business eight years ago, but John continued along with his loyal staff, Noeleen Riley and Val Hayward. Both staff continue with the new owner, John's cousin, Mathew Healey. I would like to congratulate and thank John on his 55 years of quality customer service and wish him well with his retirement.
