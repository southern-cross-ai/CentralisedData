        . Executives at NBN Co and Australia Post received nearly $300 million in corporate bonuses during the pandemic. This waste of money is just business as usual for the Liberals. They spend taxpayers' money as if it were small change. At the same time, people in places like East Kurrajong, Sackville, Ebenezer and Blaxlands Ridge and right across to Yarramundi have had to queue in post offices during a pandemic because Australia Post won't deliver parcels to their door, nor will Australia Post pick up from small businesses in the Blue Mountains such as Kirrily's Needles vs Thread. Kirrily, who is in a wheelchair and makes wonderful bags, says the service hasn't been available to her business since the start of the pandemic. She knows another small business owner who struggles to take more than 100 parcels at a time to the local post office, where we all know staff are doing their best to cope with the extra load. As Kirrily's business and other small businesses head into what they desperately hope is going to be a busy Christmas trading period, they want to see this problem fixed. They want Australia Post to do its job, serve Australians and help them do business.
