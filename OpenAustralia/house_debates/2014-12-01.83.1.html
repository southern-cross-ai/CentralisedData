        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister take so long to discover that his cuts to Defence allowances were unfair? Given that funding for a real wage increase was included in the budget, will the Prime Minister now commit to providing a fair pay deal for our Defence men and women?

        <p>
         I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has noticed that we have restored the allowances that were removed as part of the deal in question. No-one dislikes more than I do the fact that we have to have restraint at these times in questions of pay. No-one likes the necessity for restraint, particularly when it comes to Defence pay. But what is possible with $20 billion surpluses is not possible with $50 billion deficits.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that members of our armed forces would prefer to have a three per cent or above pay increase, but members of our armed forces are citizens as well as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel. They understand that the government does have to live within its means after six years of debt and deficit disaster from members opposite. They know that if Labor had not run the budget into such massive debt and deficit it would be much easier to pay them more than it currently does.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing that members of the Defence forces well understand is that members opposite, when they were in government, cut $16 billion from Defence spending. Members opposite, when they were in government, reduced Defence spending as a percentage of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         to the lowest since 1938. Members of the Defence forces know that Labor's cuts led to 119 Defence projects being delayed, 43 Defence projects being reduced in scale and eight projects being cancelled altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
         So I think that members of our Defence forces think that the Leader of the Opposition has a bit of a hide asking questions like this. Members of our Defence forces know that, in terms of defending our country, it is very important that we get the economic defences right as well as the physical defences. That is what this government is doing. This government is giving us the economic strength which is necessary to ensure our country's defence strength and defence security as well.

             I thank the honourable member for Robertson for her question and recognise that, despite some of the challenges we have had in the budget, we have been able to set up an
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Taxation Office
             </a>
             in Gosford with up to 600 employees. That is hugely important for the

              New South Wales
             </a>
             , which has very high unemployment. It is important that we actually focus on dealing with the legacy of debt and deficit left behind by Labor—$667 billion of debt, without any action, in 10 years time. As I said before, that equates to $25,000 for every man, woman and child in 10 years time.
            </p>

             It is only the coalition that has a plan to fix the mess that has been left behind by Labor. As

             Preferring populist posturing—that is the Labor Party way. We know that. In fact, for some odd reason, I had a grand choice on the

             just before question time of

             . I was channel surfing, looking for some sport or anything else, but I could not help but listen to the Leader of the Opposition, who said before question time words to the effect, 'If you want to fix the budget, get rid of the savings that are in the budget.' I thought: 'Hang on; how does that work?' He says, 'Dump the Medicare co-payment, dump the fuel excise and dump all the things that actually save money.' And do you know what? He reckons the budget would actually be in better shape. I have heard that before—when the Leader of the Opposition was out there, saying, 'Great news, Australia; we've delivered a budget surplus,' or when our old mate, up there in the back stall, the member for Lilley—you can look up now, Swanny, thank you—said at this dispatch box, 'The four surpluses I announce tonight'—
