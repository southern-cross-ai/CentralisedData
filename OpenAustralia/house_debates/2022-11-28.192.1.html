       <p>
        This year, 2022, is a very significant year for Australian military commemorations. In particular, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the Battle for Australia, which was a series of engagements during the Second World War around our mainland and the Indo-Pacific. It included the bombing of Darwin, the city that I'm so proud to represent, by 188 Japanese aircraft on 19 February 1942, which killed more than 250 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year we also cast our minds back 80 years to the sinking of HMAS
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        in action in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . On 1 December 1942, 100 Australians died during the sinking of HMAS
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        . This was the largest loss of life from any corvette in the Second World War. The
        <i>

         i
        </i>
        <i>
         dale
        </i>
        was operating out of Darwin. It left Darwin with orders to evacuate our troops and civilians from Timor in the face of the Japanese invasion. Operating in broad daylight, the
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        took a direct hit. Among the crew of the
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        was a young Tasmanian called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sheean" rel="nofollow">
         Teddy Sheean
        </a>
        , who was, of course, posthumously awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        a few years ago for heroically staying on the sinking
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        to fire on Japanese aircraft, stopping them from strafing his mates who were in the water.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very proud of all the efforts of members of this parliament and the Tasmanian state government, and of the Sheean family and friends, who worked and campaigned so hard to get justice for Teddy. I was particularly proud that we all rose in the chamber and spoke up when former Prime Minister Morrison said no to Teddy Sheean getting that VC. We forced a situation where it was reviewed, and the decision was finally made for him to receive that award. I want to pay tribute to Teddy Sheean and those 49 men who were stranded at sea after the sinking and who suffered repeated attacks from the Japanese and also from sharks in the waters of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        . It is an amazing story.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year is also the 80th anniversary of Australian forces desperately fighting to push back the Japanese along the Kokoda Track in Buna, Gona and Sanananda, in Papua and in New Guinea, on the Huon Peninsula, at Wewak and on Bougainville. As well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        I, this motion invites us to reflect on the 75th anniversary of Australian peacekeeping efforts this year. Australians were part of the first United Nations peacekeeping operation when military observers were deployed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies" rel="nofollow">
         Dutch East Indies
        </a>
        —now called Indonesia—in 1947. In every year since that time, Australian peacekeepers have served in locations throughout the world, ranging from the Middle East, Africa, South-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_and_the_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         East Asia and the Pacific
        </a>
        ,. Finally, this year is also the 50th anniversary of the year that Australia's fourth iteration of national service was abolished by the Whitlam Labor government on 5 December 1972.
       </p>
       <p>
        These were all exceptionally important events in our national life. It's only fitting that we thank all former and current personnel for their service in these and in other operations.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASPI" rel="nofollow">
         ASPI
        </a>
        fellow Graeme Dobell recently wrote that, over a span of 90 years, Australia went to war no fewer than nine times. He reflected that, over the 100 years since 1914, Australian personnel were on active service for 47 years or half of that time. That's incredible and it says a lot about Australia's involvement in world affairs relative to our population and about our standing up for what is right, standing up for freedom and standing up against oppressors. Our country has seen a significantly intense period of service in the last 20 years in particular, but, at this time, we remember
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        , we remember the peacekeepers, and we remember all those who served and their families.

          <p>
           I'm pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge and recognise all those who have defended our great nation at home and overseas. It is because of their service, sacrifice and bravery that we experience freedom and peace in Australia today. Thank you to the member for Solomon, Mr Luke Gosling, for bringing this very important motion to the House. We should never take for granted our lucky country because it came at a cost. Today I join with my parliamentary colleagues to recognise those who served in the land, air and sea complex as part of the battle for Australia which successfully subdued the threat to our country during the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            Second World War
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           We have enjoyed sovereign piece for a long time in our nation. In 1942, Australian forces dug deep in Kokoda to stop the Japanese advance.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English" rel="nofollow">
            The English
           </a>
           had been defeated in Singapore and the Americans had lost the Philippines. The first to turn back the Japanese were the Australians in Papua
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
            New Guinea
           </a>
           . And those Australians weren't only members of full-time divisions; they were people who were walking the streets of Sydney one day and the next day were fighting the Japanese on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Trail" rel="nofollow">
            Kokoda Trail
           </a>
           . If Australia had lost and the Japanese had advanced onto our mainland, the Australia we know today would be entirely different. The rights and liberties we enjoy today would be horrifically different, so we remember the soldiers, airmen, sailors, nurses, doctors and others who served who, in many instances, were maimed or died for the protection of our great nation, Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           War comes at an immediate cost, but there's also a greater hidden cost that takes a significant toll in the years that follow. There are families that have been left without loved ones. This is a grief beyond measure. Today I pay my respects to the families who have lost loved ones and to those who have supported the loved ones who have served. The toll is great on our veterans. Many returned service men and woman come home with significant trauma—experiences that stay with them for a lifetime. It is crucial that we don't abandon our veterans at this time. People who have been good enough to put their body on the line—to put their life on the line—for this country deserve our complete support when they return home, and so do their families.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a nation, we must prioritise the wellbeing of our veterans and give priority to investment into their support services. The prevalence of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
            PTSD
           </a>
           and suicide among serving and ex-serving defence personnel is something of deep concern to both sides of this House. When in government, the coalition invested a record amount for our veterans. This is a legacy that I'm extremely proud of. We made it easier for veterans to make claims by establishing online digital access, and we funded additional staff to help deal with the backlog. The coalition government committed $5 million in my electorate of Dawson to fund a veterans wellness hub. This would have brought an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
            RSL
           </a>
           to Mackay, a wellness centre to the Mackay Memorial pool complex and a retreat to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinchant_Dam" rel="nofollow">
            Kinchant Dam
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           I was disappointed that in Labor's first government budget, veterans wellness hubs north of Brisbane were canned. Centres like this are a fantastic initiative and will make a big difference in the lives of those who can access their services. Investing in supportive services for our veterans is too important to be on the chopping block. These cuts are devastating. However, I will work with the government to see that these services are fully supported and provide the much-needed services for our veterans, no matter what their postcode is. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Ken Higgins, president of the Mackay RSL, for the support he provides to the veterans and for his strong advocacy on this project. I also thank
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Payne" rel="nofollow">
            Keith Payne
           </a>
           VC—you could talk forever about Keith Payne—for his work on the Kinchant Dam retreat. Our community is stronger because of local champions like these guys.
          </p>
          <p>
           The protection and sovereignty of our nation is paramount. We must take every effort to support our defence personnel, past and present. We are indebted to them forever. Thank you for your sacrifice. We will be there for you.

            </a>
            personnel in my electorate and around Australia for their efforts defending our country and keeping us safe. The work you do is a source of national pride. We simply would not be able to live the lives we enjoy today if it weren't for you. That's why it is so important that we take the time to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for us. Every loss of life in our Defence Force is a tragedy, and they all deserve to be remembered, respected and commemorated often.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also appreciate that the member for Solomon has acknowledged the families of those who serve. It is no easy thing to have someone you love in our Defence Force. It is no easy thing to be the one left behind. I have always had a special place in my heart for the families of those who serve. They are a big part of our community on the

            . I guess it shouldn't have been a surprise to me when I became one of them. My eldest son joined the Army a couple of years ago, and we are so incredibly proud of him. But, like many, he's based far away, so it has meant a huge separation, and we don't often get the opportunity to see him. I am inspired by all those local defence families who provide such a fantastic example, and I want to acknowledge their importance. Organisations like the Shoalhaven Defence Families Association, the Nowra Veteran Wellbeing Centre and our veterans organisations all provide an incredible local support service to help families through this journey. I so admire what you do.

            Our RSL sub-branches are, of course, nothing short of incredible. Run by volunteers, they provide an invaluable service to our local community. I want to sincerely thank every RSL sub-branch on the South Coast for the work you do every day. I also want to make special mention of the Gerringong RSL sub-branch, who, on 18 November, celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Soldiers Memorial Hall. I had a wonderful time at the book launch and high tea to celebrate this great event. Well done to president Mike O'Leary, secretary Jeff McClenaughan and everyone involved.

             I start by thanking the member for Solomon for moving this motion. In fact, I had intended to move a similar motion, specific to the 80th anniversary of the culmination of Kokoda and the Battle of Buna-Gona. I very happily instead speak on this motion. The reason I make that point is that my great uncle served and was awarded the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cross" rel="nofollow">
              Military Cross
             </a>
             at Gona Beach in December 1942. He was Major Hugh Dalby. My grandfather, Frank Stevens, also served in the Pacific theatre, in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Engineers
             </a>
             . Prior to that, he served in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
              North Africa
             </a>
             . We're very lucky in our family that he got on the boat that went to Egypt and not the one that went to Singapore, because I don't think I would be standing here today if he had. My mother's mother was a nurse during the war and served at the Heidelberg hospital in Melbourne. She nursed and cared for many, many returned
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" rel="nofollow">
              POW
             </a>
             s and other Australian service personnel who had horrendous wounds, sometimes torturous, and other awful experiences, psychologically, that they endured through that whole period of time. It's very appropriate that we as a parliament always take an opportunity to remember the unbelievable service that has been done for our nation by so many brave Australians. That service has put us in a position to live in the free society that we live in right now and to have a vibrant democracy where we can come together and talk about the issues and challenges of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
             I always find that, when people from overseas come to Australia, one thing that strikes them in every town in this country—unless they're English—is that, when they drive through the towns of this nation, there is not a single one that doesn't have a war memorial at some prominent location. Most of them, first and foremost, were built after the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
              Great War
             </a>
             , and they have then been supplemented, tragically, of course, by the need to also memorialise those who served and those who were killed in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
              Second World War
             </a>
             . The way in which service to our nation through those wars was so ubiquitous across this country is spectacular. Not a single community was untouched by both service in those wars and death in those wars. It goes to show the mentality and the bravery of the young men of this nation who, from every single corner, took the opportunity to join and serve, to fight for liberty and freedom and to give us the society that we have today.
            </p>
            <p>
             I very much join in commemorating the service and the 80th anniversary of those who served in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
              New Guinea
             </a>
             , including the two members of my family whom I've mentioned and the tens of thousands who served there, and the many who died there—both there and subsequently, because, regrettably, the statistics don't properly reflect the casualties and the fatalities from service in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
              Papua New Guinea
             </a>
             . A lot of people were repatriated to Australia but succumbed to their wounds and to other challenges that came from the brutality and the torment of serving in those conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also thank the people of Papua New Guinea—the 'fuzzy wuzzy angels' and others who provided such unbelievable service in support of Australian and allied troops in very challenging terrain. That, of course, gave our soldiers such an edge over Japanese forces. I think it was
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
              Paul Keating
             </a>
             who was a little bit dismissive of Gallipoli—I don't support his view—but he very much held the view that Kokoda was the true birth of the fighting spirit and heritage of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Army
             </a>
             because it was very much us defending against the risk of invasion of our nation and us having to be at the vanguard of turning the tide of the Japanese advance through the Asia-Pacific. We remember the service of all those Australians and many other friends from many other nations which ensured that we stopped that tide and that we live in the free democratic society that we take for granted today.

              Some of these conflicts really are the stuff of legend. They are exactly that for those, like ourselves, looking back at these conflicts historically or academically. But for the young men out there on the field some 80 years ago, there was no legend; it was just about survival—survival for themselves, their brothers-in-arms and the nation of Australia. Many of us have been touched by these battles. Many of us had family serving in them. It is something that we always like to learn more about, whether that be through quiet chats with relatives, through the

              touched many families across this great country and my family was no different. I would like to pay tribute to my family's service: in particular, my grandfather on my mother's side, Federal Stokie Rodda, serving as a gunner in the 2nd Field Regiment in

               Australian Army

              , serving his time in Darwin as part of our homeland defence; and his brother, Noel George Burnell, a flying officer who paid the ultimate sacrifice, killed in action in New Guinea as part of No. 23 Squadron. His memory is immortalised in the Lae Memorial in

              This year, 2022, also marks the 75th anniversary of the Australian peacekeeping efforts, something that proudly continued in the years that followed. Australia's peacekeeping efforts were not solely confined to include members of the Australian Defence Force but included police officers who were seconded to these operations, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice. Australia has always done its duty as good international citizens in times of peace, times of war and in times of civil unrest and upheaval abroad, whether this be close to our doorstep or further afield. Australia has fielded personnel to serve amongst the

              s; or by simply reading through and issuing a certificate of appreciation through the Saluting Their Service program. When an application for a certificate is provided to my office, I can't help but look through the contents of the application, which is often supplied together with the service record and their history. This is a fantastic initiative that has been a bipartisan one. I'd invite any eligible veterans from my electorate of Spence to make an application to my office for such a certificate.

              To the veteran community, I thank you for your service, and I would like to leave you in no doubt that the parliament and your country does so too.

               At the outset, I acknowledge the member for Solomon, his service, his recognition of this important motion and the service of all other parliamentarians who have worn a uniform and who have served their country. Indeed, I acknowledge all those who have worn a uniform and served their country in the past, those who do so right at this very minute, and those who will do so in the future. I also note the member Solomon's motion, which includes the 80th anniversary of the battle for Australia, the 80th anniversary of the sinking of

Many of them come to the commemorations at the Victory Memorial Gardens to honour those who went before us. That is why I will continue to fight for a wellness centre for Wagga Wagga, for those veterans.

I urge and encourage any veteran with a story to tell to take part in those important hearings. The royal commission will accept submissions up until 13 October next year. We need to protect our veterans every step of the way. That's why this royal commission is so important—to hear those stories and, more importantly, to act upon what we do here, to make sure that our men and our women are very much front of mind when it comes to legislation, front of mind when it comes to care.

I want to make sure that his service, his sacrifice, is honoured with a life-sized bronze statue in Broadway, to have that intrinsic important link that is very much at the heart of Anzac. If ever there was an Anzac story that talked about the spirit of the legend of khaki and the legend of Anzac, it is Wilfred Knight's story—a New Zealander who served for Australia and enlisted in country
