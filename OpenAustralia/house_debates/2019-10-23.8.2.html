        The Public Works Committee has recently reported to both houses of parliament, as required by the Public Works Committee Act 1969, on its inquiry into the proposed fit-out of new, purpose-built premises to be leased by the Australian Federal Police at 140 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. The new lease arises as a result of the expiry of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        's current office lease at 383 La Trobe Street, Melbourne. The committee did not identify any issues of concern with the proposal and is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of needs, scope and cost. The committee has reported that, having regard to its role and responsibilities, the committee is of the view that this project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose, having regard to the established need. The committee has recommended that the House resolve, pursuant to section 18 subsection 7 of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the work. On behalf of the government I thank the committee for again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is anticipated to commence in late 2019 and be completed by late 2022. I therefore commend the motion to the House.

        Sydney Consolidation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the House was advised on 13 February 2019 when this project was referred to the Public Works Committee during the 45th Parliament, the CSIRO is proposing to consolidate the organisation's property portfolio in the greater Sydney area through a mix of divestment, expiry of lease and consolidation of capability at five existing sites. The reference lapsed on the dissolution of the parliament on 11 April. On 31 July the project was again referred to the Public Works Committee of the 46th Parliament for consideration and report.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report on the project, the committee recorded its view that 'this project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose, having regard to the established need'. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWC" rel="nofollow">

        made two recommendationsâ€”that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it's expedient to carry out the proposed works; and that, prior to commencing the proposed works, CSIRO provide all information previously requested by the committee and evidence of how the CSIRO are addressing the concerns of the local community regarding the impact on water pressure in the event of a bushfire or emergency in the area of the Lindfield facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee again for undertaking a timely inquiry and report. Subject to parliamentary approval of the proposed consolidation project, construction is expected to commence in early 2020 and be completed in mid-2022. I therefore commend the motion to the House.
