       <p>
        I recently undertook a citywide survey to determine the areas of key concern for the constituents in my electorate. The results have shown that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Redland Hospital
        </a>
        and healthcare services in my electorate are the most widespread areas of concern for local residents. In fact, an astonishing 82 per cent of respondents identified these as their top issues of concern. The community sentiment in the Redlands is that our hospital is in crisis, with unsustainably high levels of ambulance ramping and recent news from the state government that promised stage 1 upgrades to the hospital have been significantly delayed. This is totally unacceptable, and I'll be pushing for immediate action from the state government to make sure this issue is addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also been strongly encouraging the state government to reverse the decision to impose parking fees at the hospital. At a time of such severe cost-of-living pressures, these new and unjustified charges on staff, patients and visitors are the last things that my community needs. This isn't a situation where an agreement has been struck with a private operator to build the car park and then recoup their costs later. This car park has been built entirely out of taxpayer funds—$16 million from the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government—and, unfortunately, the state government has taken it as an opportunity to revenue-raise.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to healthcare concerns, the survey identified other areas of pressing concern for Redlanders. Forty-eight per cent of respondents identified support for older Australians and aged care as areas of concern, and 47 per cent highlighted reducing the cost-of-living pressures on families.
       </p>
       <p>
        With energy prices rising, rents and mortgages increasing, and inflation eroding the value of wages, it is clear that many local households are feeling the full impact of these pressures. I'll be advocating for government responses that will make a real difference to my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The survey also found that 41 per cent of respondents are concerned about local overdevelopment; 37 per cent would like to see the duplication of the Cleveland rail line; and 36 per cent highlighted hooning and other antisocial behaviour as areas of key concern. Residents of the bay islands cited an overwhelming concern on the lack of island infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that the Redlands has not received its fair share of funding, and many locals have felt ignored and overlooked. The sentiment of the community is reflected in the responses I have received from residents during my recent doorknocking across the electorate. I will continue to advocate, to the new federal government and to the Queensland state government, to ensure that the Redlands gets its fair share of funding to address these areas of key concern. Thank you to all the Redlanders who took the time to respond to my survey and to share their views with me.
