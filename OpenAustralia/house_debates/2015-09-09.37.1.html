        , at their school during her recent visit where she spoke passionately on the topic of female leadership. It was a terrific opportunity for these young women to ask the minister questions relating to her work and about her leadership in general. Many relished the opportunity to simply meet the minister in person for the first time, and I was told that many found her to be a great inspiration.

        Bethany College is a high-performing school for girls in my electorate of Barton. Passionate teachers, a solid curriculum and excellent facilities create a positive environment for learning and fuel a thirst for further knowledge. These impressive young women are intelligent, focused and confident, and it will only be a matter of time before they unlock all of their potential and fulfil their dreams. Bethany College women are compassionate, bright and ambitious. They do not believe they are limited in any way. Whilst students are encouraged and motivated daily by their teachers, parents and communities, it is always inspiring to hear these words directly from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. The students asked a range of questions and listened to the minister's own experiences in her career, with her capacity to lead change and the kind of work she has done to enable others to achieve their best. The students were visibly impressed, as were the teachers. I would like to acknowledge the great work that Principal Vittoria Lavorato is doing in leading these young women, and I am looking forward to seeing the students again.
