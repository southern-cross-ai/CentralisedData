       <p>
        I rise today in frustration that many people in my electorate still have not been connected to the government's second-rate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . And, for those who have been connected, they're probably even worse off. The only thing slower than the government's abysmal rollout of the NBN is the speed of the internet in my home. The people of Longman have been left behind, denied a reliable internet connection because of this government's refusal to acknowledge that their rollout has been nothing short of disastrous. The people of Longman deserve better. I am fighting for them so that they get better, but it shouldn't have come to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        My predecessor, the previous member for Longman, should have fought for them too. He should have advocated for his constituents and stood up for what is right. One such constituent who has been failed by my predecessor is Paul, a resident of Caboolture. During the 44th Parliament, Paul reached out to the previous member for Longman, requesting his assistance with getting connected to the NBN. Despite Prime Minister Turnbull's historic declaration that everyone would be connected by 2016, Paul was listed on the rollout map for 2020. Paul made inquiries with the previous member for Longman, but nothing eventuated. His pleas were all but ignored. I have been fighting for Paul and every other constituent like him. It's because of Labor's pressure on the government that he is finally to be connected to the NBN later this month. Paul knows firsthand how terrible this rollout has been. He attributed it thus: 'I think the main issue is that the NBN Co doesn't have a plan or is unclear about what the plan is. If they do have a plan, they're not sticking to it.' I think Paul's pretty spot-on. He's described NBN Co's approach and he's described this government's approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        My predecessor was the Assistant Minister for Innovation in the Turnbull government. Can you believe that? He was responsible for innovation. What was the most innovative technology he could deliver to his constituents? It was corroded copper—a relic of the 19th century. Maybe his vision for the electorate was inspired by the Caboolture Historical Village; who knows? But, as my constituent noted—and I will quote Paul again—'It just seems that NBN Co have been providing our community with excuses rather than responses.' I think the time has now passed for excuses. I know the people of Longman want action. The people of Australia want action. They need more than the weak leadership offered by this government.
