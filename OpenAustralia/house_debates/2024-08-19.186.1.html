        I take this opportunity to thank every member of the

         Last Tuesday
        </a>
        my family and I gathered at Duntroon to celebrate my eldest son William's graduation from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_College" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Military College
        </a>
        . He has graduated as a lieutenant, and we couldn't be prouder of him. I say a massive congratulations to the entire cohort who graduated last week as well. You have all shown extraordinary dedication, resilience and strength throughout your time at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMC" rel="nofollow">
         RMC
        </a>
        Duntroon and you should all be proud of yourselves for what you have achieved, especially as you enter the next journey of your lives.

        For the year 12s in my electorate and right around the country who are nearing the end of their schooling and are unsure of what they want to do, they might want to think about a career in the Australian Defence Force. Currently there are many opportunities within the Army, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        and the Navy. In the Army there are armoured vehicle crew drivers, in the Navy there are sailors to man the upcoming nuclear powered Virginia class submarines and in the Air Force there are crew working on refilling planes and logistics. It's a great opportunity. You can consider the ADF gap year, where you can just do 12 months and get a bit of a feel for it and travel and meet new friends and develop your skills. But you might just want to apply for four years; it's not a long time. Get onto adfcareers.gov.au.
