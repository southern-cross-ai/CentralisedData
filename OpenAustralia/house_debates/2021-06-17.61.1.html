         I thank the member for Monash for his question. In the past 18 months, Australia has had to face many challenges to our way of life. We've had droughts, floods, storms, fires and a worldwide pandemic which has killed 3.8 million people across the globe. Through all the challenges we've faced as a nation, we've stayed strong and we've stayed together. I thank Australians for their resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
         A year ago Australia entered a COVID recession, but the tenacity of Australians has seen us bounce back strongly. The unemployment figures out today are remarkable—down 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent. There are more people with a job today than there were prior to the pandemic. Real jobs are created through private enterprise and through businesses both large and small. It's the government's role to provide the confidence and the economic parameters around which businesses will succeed and employ people.
        </p>

         On the storm damage, this morning I spoke to the Acting Premier of Victoria,

          I appreciate it is in your electorate, too, and it is also in the electorate of the member who asked the question, the member for Monash.

          government will consider Mr Merlino's request for additional assistance. We will do that as quickly as possible. Assistance via funding, assistance via
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force

          personnel, boots on the ground—we will do what is requested. We've already put in place and activated the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements.

          Here is an update on the dreadful storm. There are 7,000 homes in the Dandenongs without power for, potentially, a further three weeks. In Monash, the electorate of the member who asked the question, there is storm damage in Dumbalk,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Creek" rel="nofollow">
           Fish Creek
          </a>
          and Buffalo. In Gippsland, the Traralgon floods saw 87 homes with water across the floorboards. In Casey—your electorate, Mr Speaker—there are power outages in

           Macedon Ranges
          </a>
          and, particularly, in the Lancefield region. I know the member for Ballart indicated earlier this week that her electorate has also been hit. Many areas of Victoria have been hit hard by the storms. We stand ready. I know there are many, many trees down, there's severe damage and many people are doing it tough at the moment. So we will, as a responsible Commonwealth government, as always, provide what assistance is necessary and needed, and we stand ready to work with the Victorian government to this end.
