        Once again this year I was proud to host an annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        event, the Women of Lindsay Awards, in my electorate. It was a great day. We had 130 people come along to a venue that can only fit 120, with a waiting list. I think that shows the strength and courage of the women in my local area to stand up and be counted. Jane Caro was our special guest speaker, who came and inspired everybody who was present at the breakfast.
       </p>
       <p>
        We weren't just joined by women in the electorate. There were a few blokes there to support our women, and I'm very pleased to say that they were also included.

        of Lindsay Awards go to people in our electorate who have demonstrated leadership in advocating for and enhancing the lives of women in our community. I'm pleased to announce this year's Women of Lindsay Awards and to read these women's names into

        Educator of The Year goes to Mandii Clark, who is a student at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSU" rel="nofollow">
         WSU
        </a>
        studying a Masters of Teaching. She's also dedicated her time to run a number of projects which have benefitted both students and members of the community and students. The most notable, for me, was Who Bleeds Wins, an event that encouraged university students to donate blood to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Woman" rel="nofollow">
         Young Woman
        </a>
        of the Year goes to a younger person this yearâ€”quite often we overlook young people, but I think young people doing amazing things are quite exceptional. Georgia Wood, from Caroline Chisholm Society, has raised funds to purchase and assemble welcome packs for clients of the Haven women's shelter. As I said to Georgia on the day, and I'll repeat it here, it's often the case when you're young that it's hard to be different from your peers. To be different from your peers and to stand out from them sometimes means taking a risk, and sometimes standing up for other people when you're 15 is not the cool-kids things to do. So I applaud Georgia for all of her work.

        Emma Hogan was Junior Woman of the Year. I've known Emma since before I was elected. She's the

        advocate in my electorate. She's doing amazing things. She comes to me with a scrapbook and adds all the things she's been doing, including visiting overseas, coming into parliament as a delegate, and supporting and fundraising for people living with type 1 diabetes.
       </p>

        Businesswoman of the Year went to

        Sportswoman of the Year went to Linda Cerone. Over many years, Linda has served her local club as a volunteer and the association as a well-respected employee. She's the deputy chair of a

       </p>

        Artist of the Year went to Celeste Cannell, who is the author of

        There are so many amazing women that I'll have to come back and read you the next lot.
