        One of Bunyip's gems is Tony Arrigo, who was awarded the Order of Australia this year for exceptional service to the Bunyip community. Tony arrived in Australia from Italy in 1962 and has always remembered how friendly and welcoming the locals were. Since retiring from work at the Berwick Potteries in 2007, Tony has dedicated himself to working for the betterment of the Bunyip community. He served on most of the committees in the town as well as having been foundation director of the Bunyip community bank, and serving 13 years as a member of the Bunyip Fire Brigade and 20 years as a volunteer and board member of Hillview Bunyip Aged Care. He was presented with life membership last year.

        Tony's other passion was to establish a soccer club once he retired. In 2008, he set up the Bunyip soccer club, which started off as a rough patch of dirt. Today, things are different, with the club about to officially open its new $3 million state-of-the-art pavilion. Tony served the Strikers for seven years as president and then he was very fortunate to have the assistance of his wife, Carmelina; Roman Kulkewycz as secretary; and Alan Cole as treasurer in the club's formative years. Within two years, the Strikers were playing in the prestigious

        competition. The club honoured Tony with a life membership in 2018.

        In 2016, Tony was awarded the Bunyip &amp; District Australia Day Citizen of the Year award, and continues to remain well known for his leadership. He's always ready to help. Tony said he was humbled and very surprised to receive the

        . Tony always wanted to give something back to the community in acknowledgement of the kindness shown him in 1962, and he's done so in spades. I seek leave to table the full statement.
