       <p>
        Whilst the question of same-sex marriage has not been often raised with my Groom electorate office—education, social services and local infrastructure dominate—I have had the opportunity to have a wide range of conversations with those for, both those who identify as members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community and those who don't, and with those against, both those who identify with various faith communities, for example, and those who don't. Whilst I will continue to engage with constituents regarding this issue in the coming weeks and months, and people will certainly exercise their right to continue to campaign either way, I encourage as many as possible to participate in the current survey. It's in line with the coalition's commitment to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to have their say.
       </p>
       <p>
        My own views have been on the public record for some time—I happen to support the traditional definition of marriage. But this is about all Australian people having the opportunity to have their say. In the true Australian spirit and tradition, I encourage respectful debate and a recognition of differing views as our nation, be it in my electorate of Groom or right across the country, moves to resolve this significant issue.
