        (1) condemns:

        (2) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Financial Assistance Grants are used by every local government in Australia to maintain local roads and deliver critical community services;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government's indexation freeze represents cuts of $925 million to local governments in every town and city over the next four years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) regional and remote councils will be most affected by the cuts, with larger service areas and more kilometres of roads to maintain per ratepayer;

       <p class="italic">
        (d) the viability of some regional and remote councils may be compromised as a result of the cuts;

        (d) with the cost of doing business increasing due to the carbon tax, small businesses lose confidence, invest less money in their business, and are forced to employ fewer staff; and

        (a) the ethnic and sectarian unrest in parts of Myanmar, including Rakhine state and the Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon regions, but in Rakhine state in particular, has created significant humanitarian concerns given that the latest iteration of displacement has been going on for almost two years;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the national census in Myanmar in April 2014 has led to a deepening of the humanitarian crisis due to the census boycott by ethnic Arakanese groups and the alienation of minority communities as a result of questions relating to ethnicity and religion, including the refusal to allow Rohingya Muslims to self-identify as such;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) on 27 May 2014 Myanmar's state-run media published a draft law on religious conversions that would impose unlawful restrictions on citizens wishing to change their religion, which would encourage further repression and violence against Muslims and other religious minorities;
