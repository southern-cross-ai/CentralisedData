       <p>
        Today I want to reiterate the huge sigh of relief of thousands of Canning self-funded retirees are now taking now at the Rudd government’s embarrassing backflip on stripping 22,000 senior Australians in Canning of the popular Commonwealth seniors health card. The government’s attack on the seniors health card would have seen non-wealthy self-funded retirees missing out on discounted pharmaceuticals, discounted travel, telephone allowances and eligibility for future bonuses. The plans would have seen them at least $2,000 a year worse off. I am delighted to say that this is now not going to happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        After addressing the House in March on this issue, my office was inundated with calls from concerned locals. I have been stopped on the street by self-funded retirees quite rightly appalled and outraged by the government’s plans to raise eligibility requirements for the health card from 1 July this year. Under immense pressure from the coalition, the anger of thousands of senior Australians and the strong representations of seniors organisations, the government has shamefacedly retreated on its plan to include drawings from a taxed superannuation fund as income for the Commonwealth’s seniors health card income test.
       </p>
       <p>
        Self-funded retirees continue to make overwhelming benefits to Canning—volunteering their time to local charities, joining sporting organisations and being community leaders amongst other things. They have worked hard—and continue to—and have earned the right to live without the threat of losing their government entitlements. They deserve better. I welcome the government’s change of heart on this issue, but it seems to be an uphill battle against Prime Minister Rudd for senior Australians. The coalition remains committed to making sure senior Australians do get a fair go.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many senior Australians are doing it tough and they need support. Many non-wealthy self-funded retirees have been the worst hit by the global financial crisis, with their superannuation investments decreasing dramatically in value and lower interest rates affecting their retirement savings. Let us not forget that the government’s $32.49 for single pensioners and $10.14 for pensioner couples came only after immense pressure from the coalition and overwhelming public outcry. Instead of stalling on the outcome of the review, the government could have supported the coalition’s bill last September, introducing an immediate rise in the base rate of the pension by $30. The budget changes to the pensions this year caused great confusion to many seniors, and Mr Rudd’s attack on private health insurance will see health fund premiums go up and hospital waiting lists in the public arena soar.
