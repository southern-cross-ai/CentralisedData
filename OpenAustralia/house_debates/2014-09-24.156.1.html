        Today I wish to remember, with deep respect and sympathy, the five members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_family" rel="nofollow">
         Hunt family
        </a>
        : Geoff, Kim, Fletcher, Mia and Phoebe. Yesterday, in the small town of Lockhart in the Riverina, they were farewelled, first with a private funeral and then in a celebration at the Lockhart Recreation Ground. It was an emotional and moving ceremony.

        </a>
        communities are strong and warm and generous. They gave much to the nation, sending their young men to two world wars. Their farms produce grain and livestock and contribute to the regional economy. The community come together frequently around their football and netball teams, their volunteering efforts, their small country schools. Throughout all is love of land, of community, of family.
       </p>
       <p>
        At yesterday's ceremony, family and friends talked about these five special people.

        family were at the forefront when it came to helping. Their kindness and generosity shone through every word that was spoken in every reflection: Geoff as a devoted father and family man, a talented waterskier, tennis player and golfer, with a great sense of humour; Kim as a passionate and energetic community member, a wonderful nurse, chef and gardener. Fletcher was remembered for his love of motorcycles and his sporting talent. At age 10, playing in the under-14 team, he kicked five goals. Mia was remembered for her empathy and openness as well as her aptitude for tennis and netball. Phoebe, unsurprisingly as the youngest, was bossy, persistent and full of charm.

        , and Kim's brother-in-law, Terrence, mentioned a birthday party for Kim at the couple's farm at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Watch Hill
        </a>
        . Describing Kim, in a moment of sheer fun, jumping from the rafters into the arms of several people below, he said that in his memory she seemed to float slowly through the air and alight like a butterfly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The family was struck by tragedy when Kim had a serious car accident two years ago, and her road back to her home and her family was long and painful. Her bravery and determination was remarkable, as was the dedication of Geoff, by her side every step of the way, but—as her incredible sister, Jenny, has said—the effects of the injury took their toll.
       </p>
       <p>
        At yesterday's public memorial the spirit of this small town was on display, and the care and compassion that will wrap around everyone touched by the tragedy were unmistakable—in particular, two of the great human qualities: gentleness and the ability to forgive. In loving memory.
