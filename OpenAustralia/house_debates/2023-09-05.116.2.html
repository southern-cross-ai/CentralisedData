        has the best renewable resources in the world. There are already many large-scale, mostly foreign owned, renewable projects happening across the country. There is no question we need a rapid build of grid-scale renewable projects, generation storage and transmission if we're to meet the government's target of a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. My electorate of Indi holds two renewable energy zones. Grid-scale solar projects are being built at pace near Glenrowan and Benalla, while the Meadow Creek Solar Farm in the

        and the Seymour Wind Farm in the Strathbogie Ranges are in the early stages of planning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ambition renewables represent is critical if we are to meet our decarbonisation targets. But if we are to meet our national ambition, then the communities who live near these projects deserve to be adequately consulted with and offered opportunities to benefit long-term in the development of these projects. We need to be as ambitious for regional communities as we are for the nation as a whole. It is entirely reasonable and right that people have questions about how these projects will impact their community, property, insurance premiums and farming operations. These concerns are often dismissed as objections to progressâ€”

        ism and whingeing farmer stereotypes. But not every question is an objection. Regional communities are hungry for practical ideas about how to maximise the opportunities of the transition, but there are limited entry points for local farmers and families to engage in the process to work with developers and to co-invest in the large-scale projects happening at their farm gate. The economic benefits for regional communities most affected by these projects are not being realised.

        , to initiate a review into community engagement around renewable energy infrastructure projects. The review will provide the government with practical recommendations on how to maximise community engagement and community benefit in planning, developing and operating energy infrastructure. Submissions are now open, and I encourage people across regional Australia to make their voices heard through this process. I'm pleased the review will address impacts of energy infrastructure development on the environment or on agricultural land, including emergency management, fire and biosecurity risks, increases in landholder insurance premiums, tourism impacts and visual amenity.

        Communities must be able to raise their concerns and have them heard by governments and corporate developers. Critically, they must materially share in the benefits of this energy transformation. We cannot accept that profits go offshore and communities have no say. I've been a strong, practical voice for farmers and regional Australians since coming to this place. They deserve a share of the economic benefits of the renewable energy boom, and community engagement is at the centre of that.
