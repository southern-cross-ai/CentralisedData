        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the 166 occasions that she promised to deliver a surplus. I refer the Treasurer to the 366 occasions that he promised to deliver a surplus. How can the Australian people ever trust the Prime Minister's word when she said on all those occasions that, in order to make life easier for Australians, she would make sure the government lives within its means?

         <p>
          Thank you very much, Speaker. I thank the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
           North Sydney
          </a>
          for his question. I can see that the summertime fitness regime has involved weight lifting as well. Congratulations to himâ€”well done!
         </p>
         <p>
          I refer the member for North Sydney to my earlier answer in the House, I refer him to my statements at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
           National Press Club
          </a>
          and I ask him, in what should be a year where there is the time and the space and the certainty for a sophisticated policy debate, to try and deal with the level of sophistication necessary in the economic debate before this nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          We find ourselves in a circumstance where, per unit of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
           GDP
          </a>
          , less revenue is being returned to the government than at any time since the 1990s. Indeed, around the world, other democracies, other developed countries, are also struggling with this phenomenon. There are no doubt cyclical factors at play and, as I indicated in my National Press Club speech, and as the Assistant Treasurer has said on more than one occasion, there may be some things about the accounting of profits in the modern age that need to be thought about and thought about in the context of the G20. We need to deal with facts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dealing with the facts and dealing with the revenue write-downs that we have seen, Treasury are doing their best, their best projections after the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
           GFC
          </a>
          . We have seen huge write-downs from before the GFC. Then we have seen huge write-downs again that Treasury did not forecast and did not predict. In the circumstances of those write-downs, you have got a clear choice to make: do you focus on jobs and growth or don't you? This is the choice that we faced when the global financial crisis was at its height, and we as a government said, 'You focus on jobs and growth.' I respect that the opposition made the opposite decision, and that is their judgement call. They decided that the nation should not focus on jobs and growth, and that is why they opposed our economic stimulus package. So there is a divide here. We focus on jobs and growth. The opposition is committed to the opposite, to not focusing on jobs and growth.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are at another moment where a decision needs to be made: do you focus on jobs and growth? We are focusing on jobs and growth. If the member for North Sydney wants to lead the economic debate of the opposition once again into not focusing on jobs and growth, that is a matter for him, and he will be held to account for it. But there is nothing more important to this Labor government than the jobs of working people. We have put them first in the most difficult of economic days, and we will put those jobs first now.

          <p>
           Madam Speaker, I ask a supplementary question to the Prime Minister. Given now that, on over 500 occasions, she and the Treasurer have said that there will be a surplus, I refer her to her statement in 2011: 'You can't run this country if you can't manage its budget.' Given that this government can't run the budget, Prime Minister, shouldn't you just give up trying to run the country?

            : first, if he wants to be taken seriously by anyone then he needs to deal with the facts. He knows that what we have seen with the government's budget is a revenue write-down, and he should acknowledge that.

We have adhered to a medium-term fiscal strategy to contain expenditure. What is happening in the government's budget is not increased expenditure; it is revenue coming down.

                away from that. So we need to deal with thatâ€”yes, we doâ€”but I will hold the member for North Sydney to account for the words he said today. I take that to mean that he will publish full costings of all policies in a timely way, and he can start by giving full and proper costings of every policy utterance made by the Leader of the Opposition to date, because not once since the 2010 election has the opposition produced a policy with a proper costing or credible savings.
