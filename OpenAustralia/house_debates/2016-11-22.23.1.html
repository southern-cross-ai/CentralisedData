        Deputy Speaker, yes, I do appreciate the right of reply, but I am not going to question anything that the member for Rankin has said. It is true that Rankin did win the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Unity Cup
        </a>
        , which is a competition between the Muslim community in Moreton and the Muslim community in Rankin. They let Jim and me be honorary Muslims for the dayâ€”perhaps honorary cricketers for the day might be more accurate!
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the captains, Ahsan Assadi, who led the winning team for Rankin, and Ali Kadri, from my team, and the mighty Rohingya Strikers and others who turned out for Moreton. I know that they will have learnt some lessons. They have studied the bowling of the member for Rankin. I know that we will be able to pick it apart next year. And I do give this commitment to the people of Moreton and the cricketers from that team: I will not bowl in the final overs, because I know we got into trouble with 11 runs off the second-last over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you again to the umpires, Steve Buckland and Phil Barnsley, and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cricket" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Cricket
        </a>
        for support generally and for sending Billy Stanlake along from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Bulls" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Bulls
        </a>
        . I also thank our guest umpire in a wheelchair at square leg, Mohammed, who did some great work as well. I know that James Stedman scored scrupulously fairly. I will work on that because obviously, with Moreton losing, I need to increase that score. Thank you to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">

        and all those who participated in the Unity Cup.
