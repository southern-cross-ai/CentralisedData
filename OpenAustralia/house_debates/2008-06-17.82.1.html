       <p>
        I rise today to put on the public record my condolences to the family of Michael Francis Nolan, better known to his friends and family as ‘Mick’. Mick was a premiership player for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         North Melbourne
        </a>
        . In fact, he played in the Kangaroos’ inaugural premiership in 1975. Mick played over 100 games for the Kangaroos and was known as the Galloping Gasometer, a nickname given to him by Collingwood legend

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        career had finished, Mick and his loving wife, Netty, moved to Queensland. This was the beginning of a successful playing and coaching career with the Mayne
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Football Club
        </a>
        . On 1 June this year a special tribute luncheon was held in Brisbane just days after Mick’s passing. He was awarded life membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         North Melbourne Football Club
        </a>
        , as well as becoming an inaugural member of the Queensland Australian Football League Hall of Fame. Former team mates, friends and family toasted the life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Nolan" rel="nofollow">
         Mick Nolan
        </a>
        , a life that was cruelly cut short by cancer. Mick was just 59.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mick was a country boy. He was born in Wangaratta on 9 November 1948. He loved the country life and enjoyed all the activities that it had to offer. He spent his days fishing, shooting and playing football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I knew Mick through his sons Rick and Danny, who played in premierships for me at St Mary’s Football Club in Darwin when I was coach. We tried to lure younger brother Dale to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        without success. Mick was immensely proud of his sons and their achievements on and off the football field.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mick was an imposing man, a mountain of a man; however, he had a heart of gold. We shared a few beers and some tears after grand finals, and most of our conversations centred on what footy meant to us and how we felt about the young men who played under our guidance. I valued these conversations and looked forward to them as the finals approached each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mick is survived by his wife of 36 years, Netty; sons Ricky, Danny and Dale; grandson Noah; and daughters-in-law Anne Marie and Jackie. Mick Nolan passed away on 27 May. His funeral was held at St Gerard Majella Catholic Church in Brisbane. It was raining heavily on the day of the funeral and as I arrived at the cemetery I spoke to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Helen Smith
        </a>
        , a close and dear friend of mine and a cancer survivor as well as being Mick’s sister. She commented that Mick would be up there claiming he had already broken the drought—and he probably did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mick Nolan—footballer, father, friend, fisherman and family man—I was proud to call you a friend. Your family, while mourning your passing, can take solace in the fact that you were so widely known, loved and respected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of my own colleagues in this place—and I note that the member for Hotham, who is a North Melbourne supporter, is here, and I thank him for that—have commented to me about Mick Nolan: put simply, he was a bloody great bloke. Let me conclude by quoting a small part of a tribute written by Netty:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We as a team made our home a very loving and happy place for our family and friends. This journey with you has made me a very lucky person. Your love from above will help me travel alone. I will always love you and still need you so please stay close.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mick Nolan, the Galloping Gasometer, rest in peace.

         always said of Mick Nolan that he was the best tap ruckman he ever roved to, and that is an accolade indeed from a champion rover. I was away at the passing of Mick and I had not caught up with it, unfortunately, but it is a great loss in the tragic circumstances in which it happened. I too extend my condolences to his family.
