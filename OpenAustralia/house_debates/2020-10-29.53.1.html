        COVID has been tough on everyone this year, but particularly hard on the more vulnerable. Thankfully in Bennelong we have many hardworking and caring organisations to make sure that nobody was neglected. Christian Community Aid is a wonderful local organisation that has operated in Bennelong and the surrounding area since 1965. They provide a huge number of services, including community learning, home delivered meals and community support. During the restrictions imposed by COVID and the other associated impacts on our community,

        has been integral to ensuring that our most vulnerable are adequately supported and cared for.

        Over the past few months I have had the good fortune of being a drop-off point for the Parramatta Women's Shelter, which is a fantastic organisation that caters for women seeking refuge in both Bennelong and the surrounding areas of Parramatta. The generosity of members of our community is astounding, especially during the height of COVID, when the shelter was under acute stress and in need of resources. Time and again I would come into my office and find our drop-off box overflowing with donations, including at one point the donation to the shelter of an entire furniture set. I thank the shelter and its fantastic staff for all of their endless acts of kindness. Thank you to these organisations and everyone who has helped those in need. It has been a wonderful time for Bennelong.
