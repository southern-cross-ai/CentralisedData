        Parliamentary Blues defeated Queensland two tries to nothing for the second year in a row. In a game no-one takes seriously, except perhaps the member for Fisher,

        Whilst I would like to say that sport was the winner, it probably wasn't. But I should praise a few strong performances. Member for Hume, 'Running Man' Angus Taylor, hit a tidy gap to streak away on the end of a beautiful ball held up perfectly and thrown by—who threw that ball? Was that me? Oh yes, it was me, but it would be hubris to point that out. He crashed through to score the try and win the game off the back of a great pass. Video referee Mark Simkin from the ABC confirms the pass left the hands backwards, and we all know video referees never get it wrong! It is also true what they say about the member for Charlton,

        : he ain't pretty—he definitely ain't pretty—but he did look pretty good as he stepped around the member for Forde, Bert 'Beattie Slayer' van Manen, and crashed over in the 80th minute to seal the win in style. The omens are auspicious, the portents are awesome, as 100,000 true Blues fans tonight turn out at
