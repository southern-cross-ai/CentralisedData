       <p>
        I rise today to speak on an issue which is causing great concern in my electorate of Cowper and in the neighbouring federal seats of Lyne, Page, New England and Richmond. I am talking about the government's plan to introduce a mandatory precommitment scheme in licensed clubs. Under mandatory precommitment all gamblers will have to register and nominate how much they are willing to lose before they can play a high-intensity poker machine in a licensed venue. Although the government have not released the legislation in relation to mandatory precommitment, they have created a lot of fear and uncertainty in clubs right across the nation. I know that clubs and their members on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        are very concerned about the impact of this proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an issue that has all the hallmarks of this government's approach to public policy. Firstly, the government has no mandate to introduce mandatory precommitment. Just as the Prime Minister had no mandate to introduce a carbon tax, the Gillard government has absolutely no mandate to inflict this policy on Australian licensed clubs. Secondly, federal Labor has once again failed to do the hard yards on developing good public policy, just like with the pink batts debacle, the school hall rorts and the border protection shambles. Just look at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        , which is currently unravelling before our very eyes. The Australian people know this government's form on public policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that the only reason that 4,000 clubs are subject to this assault is that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        needs the support of the member for Denison to remain in power. She broke an election promise on the carbon tax in order to secure the support of the member for Melbourne and now she is selling out the five million club members to win a vote from the member for Denison. It is a simple case of Julia Gillard putting political power and her own political survival ahead of the public interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are various reports on the impact of this policy. Clubs New South Wales has released details of what the costs will be to specific clubs on the New South Wales North Coast. For example, in my electorate of Cowper the forecast loss of income in the Coffs Harbour Ex-Services Club is almost $7 million. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        , in the member for Lyne's seat, the forecast loss of income is just under $5 million at the Port Macquarie Panthers club. At Ballina, in the member for Page's electorate, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        predicts this will cost them more than $4 million in lost income.
       </p>
       <p>
        If that is not a big enough hit, the clubs will then be slugged with huge increased costs. To give you one example, in the member for Lyne's electorate the Port Macquarie Panthers forecast that mandatory precommitment will cost them just under $4 million in compliance. That is $4 million of extra cost on the back of a $5 million drop in income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pain will not just be felt by the big clubs. If mandatory precommitment is imposed on all clubs, the smaller ones will also struggle to survive. The net result will be job losses, a decline in the support for community groups and the closure of many vital amenities. The reality is there is absolutely no evidence that these radical measures by the government will do anything to address problem gambling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, representatives from 70 North Coast clubs met at Laurieton in the member for Lyne's seat. They are calling on the member for Lyne to support a proposal to trial the mandatory precommitment technology on poker machines. This would allow members of parliament to fully understand what the impact on clubs would be before any vote is taken in the parliament. Additionally, the federal coalition yesterday released a policy discussion paper on problem gambling. This will provide all stakeholders with an opportunity to identify problems associated with gambling and suggest solutions. A coalition working group, in which I will be involved, will be actively consulting on a number of issues including a national voluntary precommitment program, more and better targeted counselling and support services, and a nationally consistent 'self-exclusion' program, including consideration of extending self-exclusion programs to third parties such as immediate family members. I welcome the release of the discussion paper, which will ensure that the coalition balances the legitimate right of adult Australians to gamble responsibly against the establishment of appropriate protection and support for the small number of people for whom gambling can have tragic consequences.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to read out some sample correspondence I have received from residents of the north coast. Geoff Aldwell from the Kempsey Macleay RSL Bowling Club says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introduction of such laws would be detrimental to our bowling club which receives financial support from our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL_Club" rel="nofollow">
         RSL Club
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Allan Hudson, Secretary Manager of the Kendall Services and Citizens Club says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If Mr Wilkie's prediction proves correct that this scheme will result in a drop in poker machine revenue of 40%, it is inconceivable that we can survive even if we could afford to install the technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul Mcintosh, an employee from the Coffs Harbour Deep Sea Fishing Club says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a worker in the

        Club Industry that under your Mandatory Pre Committment will likely loose his job I need to ask some questions
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What have you factered in for the cost to each Club in what you are proposing?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where in your plan does this money come from?
       </p>
       <p>
        He raises a number of good points and certainly highlights the concern within the clubs fraternity about the impact of these changes.
