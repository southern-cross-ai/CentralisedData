       <p>
        It is always rewarding as a member to share with the House the achievements of people in Dobell, and none more so than the young people who are excelling in their chosen field. Jordan Garner, who has already achieved a long list of accomplishments in golf at only 16 years of age, is one such young person. Recently I presented Jordan with a cheque for $500 from the Australian Sports Commission's Local Sporting Champions grants to contribute to the cost of his participation in the Australian all-schools golf championship. In March Jordan will be representing Australia in the 10th Faldo Series Asia Grand Final in Shenzhen, China.

        Jordan is exceptionally gifted and is passionate about his sport. He is dedicated and committed to pushing himself to be the best he can be. Consistently maintaining an attitude of positivity, Jordan believes in the value of learning from his mistakes and failures, learning how to deal with losses and using such experiences as a platform to better himself. He has committed his life to sport, training for 40 hours every week as well as attending school, and also attending the gym three to four days each week. He has played competitively since he was seven years old and his goals include attending college in the

        and turning professional by the age of 22. I wish Jordan every success in his golfing career and, especially, success in the tournament in China.
