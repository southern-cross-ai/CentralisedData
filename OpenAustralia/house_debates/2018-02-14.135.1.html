       <p>
        ( It is with great pleasure that I inform the House about some of the fantastic community organisations that have been successful in round 3 of the Stronger Communities Program from my community on the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . Firstly, there is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U3A" rel="nofollow">
         U3A
        </a>
        Northern Gold Coast, a wonderful organisation that provides educational and lifestyle courses for community minded people over 50 years of age. They've been awarded funds for the upgrade of information technology for their classes. The project will enhance the existing services that U3A provides, which currently supports over 600 registered community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, I want to talk about the Musgrave Sports Club. The club has been awarded funds for the upgrade of the Keith Hunt Park facilities. The project will enhance the facilities of the club by providing spectators, families and players with more comfortable seating arrangements. Additionally, the facility is used by many schools in my electorate that will benefit from the seating. The club also hosts the Australian Christian Games and numerous grand finals across the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Parkwood has received funding for equipment for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC" rel="nofollow">
         GC
        </a>
        100 Charity Bike Event. This is a not-for-profit bike event in its 7th year and it is one of the premiere cycling events on the Gold Coast. All profits raised go towards local, national and international charities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next comes Helensvale Rugby Union Club, which has secured funding for the Helensvale Hogs kitchen facilities. The grant will allow the club to serve the players, families and visitors a variety of healthy and nutritious food and beverages. It is a great project to encourage healthy living for all ages on the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, there is the Village Community Services, which have obtained funds for a community bus upgrade. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCS" rel="nofollow">
         VCS
        </a>
        centre can continue to deliver a very high-quality transport service for people who would otherwise be dislocated and disconnected their local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Runaway Bay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        has been granted funds for the purchase of outdoor equipment. The Lions Club, as we all know, do a cracker of a job supporting a variety of community events. The last one was the joint citizenship ceremony we ran with Lions on that great day,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Labrador Sports Club has received funding towards a hockey club bus and trailer. This will allow their team to attend carnivals and games outside of the Gold Coast area, and the bus will ensure all club members are able to participate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sailability Gold Coast has been approved for funds for the purchase of a pontoon boat. Boating has been a principal aim of Sailability in all forms for people with diminished capabilities, be they physical, intellectual or both. The pontoon boat will enhance safety, stability and access for their clients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bravehearts has funds towards a forensic interviewing pilot facility for child victims of terrible crimes. This project will help drive child protection on the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of my electorate and local community, let me thank all those organisations who applied for round 3 of the Stronger Communities grants and congratulate them on great outcomes. Special thanks to my community consultation committee:
