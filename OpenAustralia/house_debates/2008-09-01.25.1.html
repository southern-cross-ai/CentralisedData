             So, consistent with reflections made by various members of the frontbench on questions posed by those opposite, we will always examine in due course the statistical underpinnings of the propositions being put at their dispatch box. I draw attention to one such inconsistency. On the question which has just been put, if you face what we have had in recent times—a global economic meltdown which has impacted on global stock exchanges and which, in turn, has impacted on the investments of shareholders—that obviously impacts on calculations of wealth.

               That follows as night follows day. If you look across the global economy, you see stock markets across the world with very large corrections heading south, whether it is in the United States, the United Kingdom or continental Europe. The flow-through impact that has on individuals’ overall wealth calculations is therefore automatic.
              </p>
              <p>
               The key question is: what is a credible strategy for the future? The credible strategy which this government advances is: (1) responsible economic management; (2) investing in long-term productivity growth; (3) ensuring that you have a plan for nation building, because that is essential to deal with long-term constraints on growth; and (4) that you assist also with the cost of living pressures being faced by working families—

                 <p>
                  Therefore, the critical thing is that you have an economic strategy for the future, given the constraints which we inherited from the international economy, the challenges which we inherited from the domestic economy and the roll-through impact—the member for Forrest laughed to herself at the impact—of 10 interest rate rises in a row or Costello’s $400 a month interest rate hike for working families across Australia. If you want to know what impacts on overall wealth and overall prosperity for Australian families, think very carefully about the cumulative impact of the interest rate regime prosecuted by those opposite: 10 interest rate rises in a row—a $400 interest rate hike per month imposed on working families.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I would suggest that those opposite get with the government’s economic agenda being proposed in the Senate and act responsibly with us in building long-term national infrastructure; hence our proposal that we put forward in the parliament today. Get with us on the challenge to boost long-term productivity growth and get out of the way in the Senate of a responsible budget surplus which provides this nation with a buffer for dealing with critical economic challenges which lie ahead.
