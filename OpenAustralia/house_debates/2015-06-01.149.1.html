        When it comes to matters of law and order, I know there are different areas of responsibility between state and federal governments. However, every now and then someone will bring something to your attention which beggars belief. News that a 27-year-old Townsville man has been convicted of raping a four-year-old girl brought outrage to many in my city. That he also took and distributed graphic photos of the child to others should make everyone's stomach turn. News that he was sentenced in May this year and will be eligible for parole in December this year should make this country sick. The reported excuse was that he was a heavy drug user at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot be alone when I say that the oft-trotted-out line that drugs were involved and that the person is not normally like that is wearing so thin. Isn't it time we said to the people of this country, 'You are responsible for your actions'? This man, just like those who go out and bash others senseless, was not held at gunpoint when he took those drugs. He is responsible for his behaviour. I know I am treading across boundaries here, but I am just sick to the back teeth of getting calls from people who have been the victim of an abuse or worse and have been left as the victim after the courts have dealt with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not blame the judiciary here. We in the public domain rarely get to see or hear all the evidence. But, in the case of this rapist, you have a 27-year-old man befriending a family and then raping a four-year-old girl. He has taken disgusting photographs and shared them with his friends. He got caught. Then he stated that he was a heavy drug user, and now he is up for parole in December this year. How can that be so? It is not the drugs, mate. It is the individual who thinks it is somehow okay to load themselves up on steroids or ice or whatever it is they take and then go out and ruin lives. If they get caught, they are able to completely squib it like the cowards they are and say tearfully that they are not normally like that and that it was the drugs. It is not the drugs. Surely it is time for us as a society to say to people, 'You are responsible for your actions and you should take responsibility for them. You should face up to what you have done.' No amount of extenuating circumstances could ever excuse what this person has done to a four-year-old child. He should not see the light of day again because he has breached faith and trust with all of our society. We have to stand up and take these things seriously.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that we understand the difference between the state and federal governments when it comes to law enforcement and cause and effect, but no-one in this place can turn away their eyes when these sorts of things happen. It is a disgusting part of this world. To be able to stand up and say that because you were on drugs it excuses everything somehow just beggars belief. We have to be better than that. I thank the House.
