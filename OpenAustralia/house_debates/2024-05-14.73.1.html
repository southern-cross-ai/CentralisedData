        My question is to the Prime Minister. Given Labor's rationale for banning live sheep exports is based on animal welfare, can the Prime Minister name one country that has higher animal welfare standards for live exports than Australia?

          I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question, and I thank him for his engagement up there at beef week in Rocky last week. Of course, he could have a chat to the person just sitting next to him, I reckon, to get an answer for this, because in 2018 the member for Farrer introduced a private member's bill to ban the live export of sheep: live sheep export prohibition bill 2018. If he doesn't want to trust the member for Farrer, he could wander down to the member for

               cannot direct the form that an answer must have. Standing orders do not provide for that. I understand that the Leader of the Nationals would like a specific answer—in this case, about a country. Sometimes it's a yes/no answer; I understand that—yes, I understand that. The standing orders, which he knows and which every single member is aware of—and which I have explained to many members could be changed, if they wish, and also the process for doing that; no-one has taken me up on that offer from either side of the parliament!—at the moment are that the Prime Minister has to be directly relevant, if he were talking about another topic. I'm going to allow him to give some context at the beginning. He's had less than one minute into the question. He can't make his answer all about the opposition or what they have done, but I'm going to allow him now to return to the question.

                I couldn't put it better than by saying that ending live sheep exports can be 'a win for both animal welfare and business'. That was the title of the member for Farrer's opinion piece back there, arguing the case.

                He's very angry at his fellow shadow cabinet members. The fact is that what we have done is that we went to an election and committed to this, we went to another election and committed to this, and we were elected. We then had a review with appropriate recommendations. We have provided over $100 million for transition to support the industry—to support the changes that will be required for a clear transition, with time over the next four years in which to transition.
