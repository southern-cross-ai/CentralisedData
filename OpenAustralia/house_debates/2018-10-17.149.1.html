        There are so many wonderful volunteers in my electorate of Boothby working hard to support some very worthy causes. Last month the Blackwood Action Group held their inaugural Blackwood Boutiques on Parade event at the Blackwood Community Centre to raise funds for Beacon. Beacon is an interchurch emergency-relief service which supports local families in their time of need, and the Blackwood Action Group and our local community certainly came together to support these wonderful volunteers and the families that they help. The parade was compered by Tracey Yeend and City of Mitcham Lady Mayoress Tracey Spear, with Mayor Glenn Spear also helping out on the day. I was delighted to attend with my state colleague Sam Duluk MP.
       </p>

        I'd like to put out a huge thank you to local businesses Snazzi Boutique, Habitat, Accolades Boutique, Fairley's and Willywags and their fabulous models, who showcased some of their fantastic spring and summer fashions on the day. Thank you also to the many local businesses and groups who donated afternoon tea, contributed to the door prizes or provided decorations, lighting or entertainment to truly make this a wonderful community event. A very special thanks must go to the Blackwood Action Group and, particularly, Pauline Dodd for organising the parade. The $2,000 raised by the Blackwood Boutiques on Parade event demonstrates the wonderful spirit in our community, and I again thank everyone involved.

        I was also delighted to attend the Mitcham City Brass Band Concert for a Cause last month at the historic

        in Kingswood with my state colleague, Sam Duluk MP, and the mayor of Mitcham, Glenn Spear. The Mitcham City Brass Band were joined by special guest vocalists the Raymond Sisters and guest conductor Bruce Raymond, and we were treated to a wonderful evening of music and entertainment. The event raised money for the Flinders Foundation, a charitable partnership between the

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which supports vital medical research and patient care. In particular, the Mitcham City Brass Band wanted to raise funds to support kidney research. This is a cause very close to their hearts, with a member of the band having received treatment in the Flinders Medical Centre's renal unit. They have, therefore, seen firsthand the wonderful care and support provided to kidney patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our award-winning Mitcham City Brass Band—they won second place at the 2018 Australian National Band Championships—are a staple at local community events and special functions, including a recent performance at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">
         Government House
        </a>
        . Their success and popularity in our community is a credit to all of the band members, and I commend them on their fantastic fundraising efforts for the Flinders Foundation. Congratulations and thank you to Mitcham City Brass Band musical director, Steven Packer, chairman Peter Milter and all of the very talented musicians who performed on the night. A wonderful time was had by everyone in attendance.
