        , pretending he will be by your side and then bailing the minute you need him most. When he worked out that he could not destroy the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        he got the coalition to give it a big group hug. He promised that he would deliver it by 2016 and it would be faster, cheaper and would have a speed of 25 megabits. With the NBN, everything Malcolm promised turned out to be the wrong way. The speed should have gone up but it went down. Costs should have gone down but they went up. The rollout should have gone faster but it went slower. The suburbs with the worst broadband connections had to wait the longest, while the best suburbs were getting the NBN.

        , who wrote, 'Malcolm Turnbull [is] … delivering less than he promised for twice the price.' I do remember, as will everyone in this place, who was up there saying that this project—a project that had been demonised—was a great project, kicked off by Labor? It was none other than the member for
