        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Will the minister inform the House how the government is enhancing services and support for veterans and their families?

         I would like to thank the member for her question, and I note her commitment to veterans and ADF members in her electorate. On Sunday, we announced landmark funding for veterans and their families. As the Prime Minister has said, we best honour the diggers of a century ago by supporting the service men and women, the veterans and their families of today. This funding will do just that. The funding will give an extra $350 million to veterans, which will add to the $12 billion we spend on veterans each year. It will see two of the biggest challenges facing veterans addressed: mental health issues and claims times.
        </p>
        <p>
         Previously, veterans had to prove that mental health conditions were service related and wait for claims to be processed before being treated. Twelve months ago, the government provided a free and immediate treatment program for five mental health conditions for veterans and serving defence personnel. This funding will now include an extra $33.5 million to expand non-liability health care from five mental health conditions to all mental health conditions. It will mean any Australian who has served a single day in the full-time military will get access to free and immediate treatment for any mental health condition without having to prove it was service related. This is critical. No veteran or ADF member will be without the mental health care they need, and they can get that help immediatelyâ€”because everyone in this House knows the importance of early intervention. It is a measure that is demand driven and not capped. If an eligible person requires treatment, it will be paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
         This funding will also begin the government's response to the National Mental Health Commission's report into veteran suicide by providing $9.8 million to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and improve care and support. We will also expand the eligibility for the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service by increasing funding by $8.5 million. The partners and children of our contemporary veterans who have had one day of full-time service will have access to the services and support provided by the VVCS.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, this funding will also deliver for veterans by investing $166.6 million in changing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Veterans' Affairs
         </a>
         processing of claims. When completed, it will mean that wait and claims times will be reduced and that veterans and their families are served by a 21st century department.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are only some of the measures that the government will deliver for veterans and their families in this funding. It is funding that will honour those who have served by looking after our current and former serving men and women.
