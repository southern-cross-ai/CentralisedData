        Surf Life Saving Club in my electorate of Cowper. On the 2nd of November past and present members will gather to celebrate this momentous milestone. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate all of those who have been part of this 100 years, this rich history, but also to reflect on the past 100 years. Like all clubs, in the beginning, in 1919, the South West Rocks Surf Life Saving Club had difficulty maintaining membership but it was the establishment of the original surf club building that changed all this. The same building that stands proudly there today. Many members from the local community and surrounding district volunteered their time, their expertise and their materials to help build the club, which was completed at Christmas time 1924. With the new clubhouse, the official opening of the surf lifesaving season drew a record crowd of 1,000 people along main beach, along with 80 automobiles—quite a spectacle, as reported by

        In 1926 Rev. Harris Walker was granted the first lifetime membership. I think it's fitting that I name all those who have received lifetime memberships: Frank Range,

        It was the dedicated leadership of Mr Frank Range, club president for two decades, who eventually brought the club its first Australian title. In 1948 the club won its first Aussie title in the junior R &amp; R event. In January 1953 South West Rocks Surf Life Saving Club is thought to be the first club in Australia to train and qualify an

        Let's not forget what this club really stands for: saving lives, and that's what these men and women have done for 100 years. They've saved tens of thousands of lives over that time, quite often putting their own lives at risk in dangerous surf conditions—generally for a total stranger.

        Thank you to all those men and women who have served the community of South West Rocks. I am proud to have been a member of the South West Rocks Surf Life Saving Club in the past. I hope you have a fantastic night on the 2nd of November. I'm sorry I won't be there. I'll see you at the national championships.
