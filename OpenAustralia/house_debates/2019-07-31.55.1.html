        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on who is on the side of Australians in rural and regional Australia who want to see their local communities grow and create more jobs?

         Just for the member for McMahon's reference, we're on this side and you're on that side—and get used to it.

         Drought notwithstanding, there are jobs in regional Australia. There are success stories in regional Australia. It's a vibrant, happening place of inventive, innovative people. Far too often country Australia is portrayed as being broken—far from it. There are good, hardworking people and they're creating jobs, they're creating employment opportunities and they're creating investment. The people of rural and regional Australia know that

         and the Liberals are on their side.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 8.8 million people now live, work and raise families outside of our capital cities—and we want to increase that number. There are now more than 600 government initiatives focused on creating jobs and driving economic growth in our regions, because, as the member for Page knows and the member for Lyne often says, when our regions are strong so too is our nation. Since we came to government in 2013 we've committed almost $33 billion to economic and social infrastructure programs which specifically benefit rural and regional Australia. That's a remarkable figure. It's a good figure and an appropriate figure. We've increased investment in the regions, reinforcing regional Australia as the engine room of the economy. It's being driven by our $60 billion agriculture sector, which we're hoping to grow to $100 billion by 2030. We have a plan to do that. Our resources and energy exports are forecast to reach a new record level of $285,000 million this financial year—and this screams jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Page knows how to create jobs. In his electorate we've invested $4.7 million under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages in expanding Whiddon Group's Kyogle aged-care centre. This project created almost 100 construction jobs and another 15 permanent roles for people living in the area. Whiddon Group

         Chris Mamarelis said that the funding is helping to keep people in the local community near their loved ones, near their support groups, near their friends. He said that 'older Australians can access quality aged care in the communities they know and love, keeping them connected to the people that enrich their lives'. That is so true.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the government's $272 million Regional Growth Fund, we're investing almost $15 million in extending Norco's Lismore ice-cream facility, which is also in the member for Page's electorate. This program is going to help secure the jobs of 830 employees across the whole of the Norco business and ensure the sustainability of the cooperative's 200 farmer members. It's great news for the region. It's great news for the dairy industry. We're funding thousands of job-creating opportunities. Mr Speaker, I'm not sure about you, but I'm pretty partial to Norco's mango and vanilla.

          I thank the Deputy Prime Minister. I might take that one on notice.
