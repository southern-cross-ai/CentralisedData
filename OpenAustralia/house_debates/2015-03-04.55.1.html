        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        We won't squib it and that's why we are determined to stick with the 1.5 per cent pay arrangements …
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister fought tooth and nail against a fair pay offer for our ADF men and women. Prime Minister: what has changed?

          What I said back then was that no-one would receive a better offer than our uniformed military personnel. That is what I said back then, and it was obvious as time went by that in order to ensure that that was the case it was important that we upped the offer made to our uniformed military personnel. Yes, I do detect a note of reproach in the voice of the shadow minister, who asked the question, and I accept that many people have said to me: 'Is this the best you could do? Is this the best you could do for those heroes who wear a country's uniform and who we often send into dangerous and difficult places to defend our people, our interests and our values?' We decided that a better offer would be made.

          I want to thank all the members of this parliament who have made such strong representations to me on this subject. I thank the member for Solomon, who has been making representations on this subject. I thank the member for Gilmore, who has been making representations on this subject. I thank the member for Herbert, who has been making the strongest possible representations on this subject. I thank the member for Curtin, who represents the

          in this parliament. I thank the member for Hughes, who has the Holsworthy defence complex in his electorate. I thank the member for Brisbane, who has the

          in her electorate. I thank the member for Paterson, with the great Williamtown airbase in his. I thank the member for Gippsland. There are many people in this parliament, and there may even have been some on the other side. The member for Riverina is smiling at me because he wants to be included. I include every member of this parliament.

             Members opposite may, in fact, be disappointed that their pleas, as well as the pleas of members on this side of the parliament, have been heard. One thing that this government will never do is sell short the defence forces of our country. We will never sell them short. We know that members opposite cut Defence spending to its lowest level since 1938. This government will support the defence forces of Australia, and the defences of this country will be in the best possible hands.
