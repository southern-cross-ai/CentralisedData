        I too am especially concerned that the government have failed to keep their promises to the people of Cowan, who continue to be ignored by this government. During the 2016 election campaign the government promised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras and infrastructure in Kiara, Beechboro and Lockridge. Crime in Kiara has almost doubled in the last year, and the CCTV cameras are necessary to create a safer community for the residents there. Despite making a commitment to the funding during the election campaign, the government are now asking the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         City of Swan
        </a>
        to apply for the funding. They are getting the city to jump through hoops to get funding through an application process that has not even opened yet.
       </p>
       <p>
        I may be new to politics but, even as a new person to this chamber, I simply do not accept that a government can make promises during an election campaign and be friends to the people during the election campaign and then turn around and completely ignore them once they are elected. I simply do not accept this. I do not think it is going too far to suggest that Australians want their leaders to earn their confidence. How does this government expect to foster strong relations with people they serve when they cannot even follow through on the promises that they made? Treat the voters with some respect and be honest with them about what you can really achieve and stand by your commitments.
