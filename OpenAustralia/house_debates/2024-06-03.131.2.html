        I would like to extend my best wishes to Oxley Island local Sui Watts, who's preparing for the 2024 open European equestrian championships, to be held in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , in July. Sui's the reigning world champion in dressage for riders with an intellectual disability, and, if it all goes well in July, she will be looking to compete at the Paralympics. Ever since she attended the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney, Sui has had her sights set on competing for herself and representing her country. Sui's parents have nurtured her dream with the purchase of a dressage pony and recruitment of a coach, Nell Marshman, from Upper Lansdowne. This July, in France, Sui will ride on borrowed horses, which is an extremely challenging task, especially when she is only allowed to have two rides on the horses before the championship. Whatever the outcome, Sui, you are a champion regardless, and I personally wish you the very best of luck.
