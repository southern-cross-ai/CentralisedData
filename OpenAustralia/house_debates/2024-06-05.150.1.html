        Moreton has a wonderful mix of cultures and ethnicities that make the south side of Brisbane rich and vibrant. There are faith celebrations, festivals, a smorgasbord of food and various languages. I only have to walk outside my electorate office to hear people talking in different languages: a daily reminder of the diversity of where I work, live and play. Moreton has constituents from China, India, Taiwan, Somalia, Ethiopia,

        , Fiji, Korea, Eritrea, Sudan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, and that's not an exhaustive list by any means.

        , over six million people speak over 300 identified languages other than English. Valuing and keeping these languages alive in Australia makes our community richer both socially and economically. But mainstream schools do not have the capacity to teach all these languages, obviously. This is where community language schools come in. Community language schools enable Australian children to learn a second language and, in so doing, expand their cultural awareness, their understanding and acceptance, and lay the groundwork for future trade opportunities. They've been going since 1857 and have helped make Australia one of the world's greatest trading countries and multicultural nations, and the world's 13th biggest economy.

        announced $15 million in grants to over 600 community language schools around the nation. This will directly assist over 90,000 students learning 84 different languages. The funding will enable community language schools to expand their programs to include more school aged children from prep up. With languages, it's always best to start early. I'm proud to say that nine different not-for-profit language schools in Moreton are recipients of this funding. That means a boost for people learning Mandarin, Tagalog, Uighur, Arabic and African languages including Amharic and Swahili.
       </p>
       <p>
        Learning these languages helps connect people to the languages of their heritage, their parents, their grandparents and communities. The students attending these schools benefit from establishing connections within the local and wider community and the inspiration to help keep cultural practices alive. The authentic teaching of home languages makes children feel understood and gives them a sense of belonging and identity as well as helping them to understand their parents' experiences and backgroundâ€”all factors that are crucial to wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also time to reflect on the role of community language schools in promoting social cohesion. Community language schools value connectedness and often organise and promote community events such as workshops, exhibitions, cultural performances and talks. We can always learn something new from our neighbours and friends from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Children are often the guides for their parents into the new Australian community. They make the transition easier and more harmonious.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to be part of a government that deeply values and supports our multicultural nation and the many benefits that come from learning a second language.
