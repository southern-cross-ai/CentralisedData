        Today marks the 174th anniversary of the rebellion led by

        on the goldfields of Ballarat. Twelve thousand miners got together under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        flag pledging to work together to protest and fight against their lack of rights as miners. They understood collectivism, and so does a man in my electorate, Ray Cody, who yesterday celebrated his 85th birthday. Ray was born in Ballarat, so I thought it was a good idea to link him today to the anniversary and to Peter Lawlor. Ray has been a staunch member of the Werribee branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

        . He has had a lifetime of working for the Labor Party for collectivism and for Australian democracy. Ray, until recently, could always be found at an election booth or manning pre-poll. In fact, he tells stories of being nine years of age in Ballarat, with his mother being the person responsible for what was then unusual: the recycling of how-to-vote cards, to make sure that everybody who went into the booths in Ballarat had a Labor Party how-to-vote card in their hand.

        Ray is 85 now and is living in aged care. I hope he had a fabulous day yesterday. I want to celebrate with him that his grandson is running for parliament. Ray goes back 85 years. His grandson, Daniel Parsell, is the Labor candidate for Fisher in the upcoming federal election. Happy birthday, Ray.
