        Since the first minute of operation on 16 March 1963, Lifeline has been by the side of Australians in some of their darkest hours. In the 60 years since, more than 23 million calls have been answered, which has made Lifeline the leading suicide prevention service in Australia. lifeline answers between 2,800 and 3,200 calls every day from Australians needing crisis support and suicide prevention services. Anyone in Australia experiencing a personal crisis or thinking about suicide can contact Lifeline. Regardless of your age, gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, Lifeline's trained volunteers are ready to listen and provide support and referrals.

        , Lifeline's 13 11 14 support line is dialled every 30 seconds and is operated by more than 10,000 volunteers and staff at over 60 locations Australiawide.

        In our area there are Lifeline offices in Bathurst and Orange with about 120 volunteers. There's been no shortage of support from Lifeline across our region recently. When the townships of Eugowra, Cudal, Molong and Canowindra were devastated by flood and storm events last November, the teams from Lifeline

        Stephanie Robinson reached out to me not even 24 hours after the devastation, immediately offering her assistance to these communities, and Lifeline has been there with them ever since. The cameras have now gone, the Army has packed up and the residents are left picking up the pieces. However, the support of Lifeline has never faded or wavered.

        There is a long road to recovery in Eugowra. Residents are still living out of caravans. Some have had to leave the town entirely, but the new normal that the people of Eugowra and surrounds are forced to endure is not being faced alone. Lifeline still visits Eugowra twice a week, setting up at the famed Fat Parcel food van and having a chat with local residents. For those needing some more structured support, individual sessions are available and Lifeline is about to start workshops supporting residents through the recovery stage of this disaster. Whether it be the residents that stepped up during the crisis or the elderly who've lost everything they once knew, Lifeline is making sure that nobody gets left behind.

        One resident that Lifeline has supported in a unique way is 86-year-old Jeanette Morris who has lived in Eugowra her entire life. When the flood and storm event hit her hometown, she lost almost everything she owned. During the clean-up efforts, Jeanette met Stephanie, the Lifeline Central West CEO, who also happens to operate Fox Hollow Cavoodles. Learning that Jeanette was living on her own, following the passing of her beloved dog Percy some 12 months prior, all the while dealing with storm and flood devastation, Stephanie knew there was one more way that she could help. Enter Truffles, one of Stephanie's cavoodle puppies that was gifted to Jeanette. In Jeanette's words, Truffles has given her a reason to go on.

        I've been fortunate enough to get to know many of the wonderful volunteers and staff at Lifeline Centra West, including support dogs Honey Crumpet, Evelyn Crumpet and Bailey, who are more affectionately known as the 'Crumpet Crew' and know what an impact they're having not just in Eugowra but across the Central West. The work of Lifeline Central West in Eugowra wouldn't be possible without the people who work and volunteer to support the town, people like Steph Robinson,

        Lifeline has been there for the community through drought, fire, floods, a mouse plague, a gas emergency and COVID, not to mention the cost-of-living crisis and the general uncertainty our global landscape is facing.
