       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge the significant achievement by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Manjimup" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Manjimup
        </a>
        , which is part of the southern forest region of my electorate. This is an organisation that punches well above its weight in good times and bad, whether that be economic downturns, legislative changes, natural disasters or the current COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the hardworking and passionate team at the Shire of Manjimup have been rewarded for their efforts by winning the inaugural Minister Coulton Award for Progressive Community Leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister's award recognises individuals, projects, leaders and local government representatives who have displayed leadership in their communities in the face of change or challenges; demonstrated best practice collaboration, engagement and consultation with their community; and established sustainable plans and strategies and implemented them successfully. The shire led a process to design an alternative growth plan when they were faced with a decline in their regional timber industry. This plan was created with locals and embraced four of the shire's strengths, and it has overseen $150 million of new investment flow into the region through private and public infrastructure in the eight years since.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to recognise the incredible passion and commitment of the team at the Shire of Manjimup, including the shire president,

        . I also want to acknowledge the significant community business and community partnerships that have been forged. Together they have reinvigorated Manjimup to create a progressive regional centre, an investor's dream, an attractive tourism destination and one of the premier food and wine producing regions in
