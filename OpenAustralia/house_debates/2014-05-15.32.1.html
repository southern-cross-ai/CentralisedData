       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to the Belmont Lions football and netball club, one of the many wonderful sporting clubs in my electorate of Corangamite. Last weekend it was my honour to officially open the new competition netball court and a second half court at Winter Reserve in Belmont. After a long battle, the netballers have finally got the court they deserve. Our government provided $130,000 of funding through the Community Infrastructure Grants Program. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of other key stakeholdersâ€”$41,000 from the Geelong and District Football League and $55,000 from the

         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        . The facilities also include fencing, a coach and scorers' shelter, and landscaping. Importantly, players now have a top-class facility and will no longer have to cross the road to

        , which was less than ideal. As a former netballer myself, I am very keen to ensure that netballers have the facilities they need. Belmont Lions still needs a women's change room. That is something I am fighting for and something which the Geelong Liberal candidate, Paula Kontelj, is fighting very hard for as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge the work of President Mal Smith and his committee, as well as netball manager, Madge Anderton, who have worked so hard to realise their dream. We are investing in many important projects and I am very proud to be supporting the Belmont Lions football and netball club.
