        I rise to recognise the contribution and the life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Walsh" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Walsh
        </a>
        , of our area, who recently and sadly passed away. Brian was a presence in our local area. He was a loyal Labor Party member, but he was particularly loyal and hardworking for the community as a volunteer. Born in Lismore in 1932 and the youngest of nine children, he spent most of his life in Lismore and did a stint in the Army in the 1950s. Remarkably, the dates here are that on 24 July 1954 he met a young, attractive usherette from the Nimbin picture show, called Eileen, and by 30 August 1954 he had proposed and by December 1954 he had married Eileen. He was married to her until his passing. He was a dedicated family man who overcame personal tribulations and tests, particularly through cancer affecting him in the 1970s and affecting his employment. But he got through that. He also did a lot of volunteering in our local area, particularly through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Druitt_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        A lot of people gathered to say their farewells to him, and a very moving eulogy was given by former state member for Mount Druitt
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Amery" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Amery
        </a>
        , a very close and dear family friend. He gave a very moving set of words about Brian's contribution to our local area, in the presence of veterans who were out in force to recognise one of their fallen comrades. To Brian Walsh, vale, and to his wife, Eileen, we pass on the very best. I seek leave to table the eulogy that Richard Amery gave, not only because it is moving but because it is one of the last times you will see typewritten words actually put in

        Leave granted.

        I also want to quickly recognise the contribution of someone else.

        of Adelaide, 78, was. He has made a remarkable contribution to the game of basketball, having played for Australia at the 1960, 1964 and 1968 Olympics, coached the Aussies in the 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984 Olympics and guided the

        to Australian crowns in 1993 and 1997. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on the weekend. It is not often that Australians get inducted there. His son, Andrew, played the game, and I am sure that he and many others would agree that it is a fitting tribute to someone who not only did remarkable things for basketball in Australia but was a true gent. He is a great person to be inducted into the hall of fame.
