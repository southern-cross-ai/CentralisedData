         It really does strike me as extraordinary that members opposite cannot understand the following basic things. Of course there are guidelines for all of the

         program—for the programs for primary schools, for the programs for secondary schools and for the National School Pride program. Those guidelines are the same across the country. The member for Petrie mentioned yesterday to me how she had resolved a problem at a local school, covered by the member for Dickson. I think you will find, Member for Sturt, if you ask many members on this side of the parliament, that they are out there talking to their local schools, helping with getting information out there and helping with getting applications in. In my own electorate I have had a meeting of the principals of every local school to talk through—

            the program. I attended a principals forum, for example, in the member for Oxley’s electorate to talk through with principals the way the program works. Members on this side of the House: (1) believe in this program, the biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history, (2) because we understand the economic stimulus effects, want this program to roll out quickly to support jobs across right across the country; and (3) understand that when you are engaged in the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen and you want to roll it out quickly for the economic stimulus and job-supporting effects, people need the information and they need the assistance. Properly, the member for Petrie provided that in the electorate of the member for Dickson to assist a school with a local problem.

            I understand that a desperate opposition want to make a cheap political point about this, led as they are by an opportunist. But before they go down this track too far, I will draw their attention to that great journal of record the

               Given the questions of so-called political interference that have been raised by the opposition, I think the words of the

              <p>
               Who is ready to support a project that is ready to go? Mr Knox is, the member for Petrie is and this side of the House is. The member for Dickson is not because he does not want this school to get assistance, and every member over there is opposed to investing in their schools in the biggest school modernisation program this country has ever seen.
