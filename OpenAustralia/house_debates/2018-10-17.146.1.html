        I rise this evening to talk about my electorate of Flynn and how important it is to the Australian economy. Flynn was created in 2006 after a redistribution of seats in Queensland. It covers eight shires: Gladstone, Banana, North Burnett,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
         South Burnett
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Highlands" rel="nofollow">
         Central Highlands
        </a>
        , Woorabinda Shire, Rockhampton and Bundaberg. Flynn was named after the founder of the

         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>

         Reverend John Flynn
        </a>
        . Its approximate size is twice as big as Tasmania, at 133,000 square kilometres. It constitutes about 100,000, with a population of 155,000 in 2016. There are almost 40,000 families in Flynn. They all deserve cheaper living costs, they all deserve cheaper energy costs and they all deserve job security.

       <p>
        The electorate of Flynn has 15 operating coal mines. They produce our thermal and metallurgical coal—what used to be called coking coal—for both the domestic and export markets. Flynn sits in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
         Bowen Basin
        </a>
        . The Bowen Basin contributed 211.2 million tonnes of coal in 2017-18. Three of Queensland's largest coal-fired power stations sit in Flynn: Gladstone, Stanwell and Callide B and Callide C. We need to invest in coal rather than demonise it. I hope the banks are listening to this. I believe we need to start planning for a new coal-fired HELE plant
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We have two major commercial goldmines in Flynn, at Cracow and Mount Rawdon. Mining commenced at Cracow in 2004 and has produced over 1.1 million ounces of gold. The Rawdon mine and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Perry" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Perry
        </a>
        has produced around 100,000 ounces of gold per annum since 2002—12.6 million ounces since 2001. The gold from Mount Rawdon has been used to make this year's

        The gemfields produce sapphires known all over the world.

        We have three gas plants on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Island" rel="nofollow">

        , and they draw their gas from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Basin" rel="nofollow">

        The port of Gladstone is the largest multicommodity port in Queensland and the fifth largest in Australia. It's the world's fourth largest coal exporting terminal. The port handles over 30 different products, including coal, aluminium, cement,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        and grain crops. Coal exports account for 70 per cent of the total cargo exported through the port, exporting to countries like Japan,

       </p>
       <p>
        We have a base water plan for Flynn. Increased water storage will increase agriculture. Agriculture is going gangbusters in Flynn. We have a large livestock industry in Flynn, with a larger group of cattle than anywhere else in Australia. Our livestock service all over Australia and the world. We must protect and drought-proof the future. We don't value water until the well runs dry. We must invest in agriculture; it's our future. I have many water projects in Flynn that need addressing, and they need addressing now. Drought is real and drought is tragic.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I am currently in the process of building a plan to make a bigger and better Flynn by building stronger roads, creating and securing jobs, lowering energy prices and making sure there is a strong future for our kids and grandkids.
