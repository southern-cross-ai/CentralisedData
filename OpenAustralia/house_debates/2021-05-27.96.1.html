        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister please update the House on the Morrison government's commitment to improving the safety of all women and children in Australia?

         I thank the member for Boothby for her question. There is no excuse for family or domestic violence, and everybody has a role to play, including governments. The Morrison government is acting to make sure women are safe in their homes, safe at work and safe in their communities. Between 2013 and this budget, we committed more than $1 billion to this effort, including the $150 million package last yearâ€”so important as we responded to changing needs throughout the pandemic. For example, we boosted support to 1800RESPECT, the national family, domestic and sexual violence helpline, which responded to more than 200,000 contacts last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         There's always more work to do, and in this budget the Morrison government has committed $1.1 billion for women's safety. This represents a down payment on the next National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Key measures include: more financial assistance for escaping domestic violence, with $5,000 payments; a two-year national partnership agreement for frontline services; $35 million in primary prevention; and $26 million to target online abuse. Importantly, it includes $12.6 million to expand the Safe Places program and provide more crisis accommodation for those who are fleeing violence. From this funding,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Salvation Army
         </a>
         , Southern Aboriginal Corporation and Goldfields Indigenous Housing Organisation projects will share in $9.6 million. Part of the funding will allow for six self-contained units to be built, which will support an additional 166 women and children each year in Albany.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that the support given to the Goldfields has been well received. Chair Dianne Logan points out that many Aboriginal women fleeing violent situations are just not comfortable in mainstream women's shelters, and having Indigenous-specific housing is critical to those who are otherwise living rough on the fringes of Goldfields communities. Local leaders like Dianne and her mother, Betty, are doing amazing work in their communities, helping women escape violent situations and shifting community attitudes. With all of these measures, the Morrison government is demonstrating our resolve to address the scourge of domestic and family violence for every Australian woman. I look forward to seeing this vital work continue.
