       <p>
        I rise to congratulate schools in my electorate of Ryan for the hard work and diligence that has resulted in their success in the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        testing. These schools are listed among the 10 highest performing schools in Queensland. They are
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill_State_School" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Rainworth State School, St Peter's Lutheran College and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Boys_College" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Boys College
        </a>
        . In addition, we have three neighbouring schools:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_Dei" rel="nofollow">
         Mater Dei
        </a>
        , St Aidan's and Hillbrook. I would also like to commend the year 7 students at Ironside State School, who rated among the top performing schools in their year bracket. I know that the principal of Chapel Hill State School, Mr Stewart Jones, the brother of the member for Herbert, is very proud that 100 per cent of the school's students are at or above the national minimum standard in 12 of the 15 categories. Parents, teachers and students must all be congratulated on working as a team to achieve these outstanding results.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NAPLAN tests help to chart a student's improvement over the period from their early schooling, in year 3, through to the beginning of the teenage years, with the final testing done in year 9. I look forward to seeing the results of this year continue throughout these cohorts' schooling. These outcomes demonstrate that schools are maintaining high levels of literacy and numeracy among their students, which is integral to providing a firm educational foundation from which to improve and grow. Strong results are reflective of a strong community. I congratulate the people of Ryan for building such a healthy and cohesive environment within which our young people can learn and develop.
