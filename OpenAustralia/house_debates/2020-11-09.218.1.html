        , a proud Arrernte and Gudanji woman, and Caroline Hughes, a proud Ngunawal woman, for their nominations in the

        Australian of the Year awards. Both are strong Aboriginal women who have dedicated their lives to championing Aboriginal culture, health outcomes and Indigenous education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Hughes has worked with the Yurauna Centre, expanding its capacity and ensuring it meets the needs of the community. Caroline is a firm believer in the power of education and has gone above and beyond in her role as a professional educator. Caroline also serves as a member of the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, representing and advocating for her community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Turner has long been an advocate for Indigenous heath, working with all levels of government in the pursuit of health justice. As the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of NACCHO, she has driven outcomes for those most vulnerable in our community and delivered meaningful, lasting change. Significantly, Ms Turner has sat as an adviser on the Indigenous voice to parliament. As one of the Uluru Statement from the Heart's fiercest champions, she has consistently stated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians must choose who speaks for them, how that happens and on what issues. On behalf of the Bean electorate: thank you, Pat and Caroline, for what you do. You are champions of our community.
