        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Canada and Mexico, from 18 April to 1 May 2009, and seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report.

       <p>
        Leave granted.

        I rise to speak to the report of the official parliamentary delegation visit to Canada and Mexico. I had the honour of being the deputy leader of this Australian parliamentary delegation between 18 April and 20 April 2009. The aims and objectives of the delegation visit were clearly laid out and largely achieved, despite the visit to Mexico being curtailed due to the outbreak of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1N1" rel="nofollow">
         H1N1
        </a>
        influenza virus. For the preparatory work, I thank Lyn Witheridge of the Parliamentary Relations office,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Parliamentary Library.
       </p>
       <p>
        The strong ties between Australia and Canada have been forged over many, many decades through both trade and military campaigns. At the Anzac Day ceremony at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Forces_College" rel="nofollow">
         Canadian Forces College
        </a>
        on 25 April, I was reminded that a Canadian soldier was killed at Gallipoli whilst serving with the Australian and New Zealand forces. Whilst I was honoured to have read the Ode, I was truly moved to witness the hundreds of Australian and New Zealand expats come together with Turks and Canadians, all paying respect to each nation’s heroes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The meetings with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         National Parliament
        </a>
        of Canada in Ottawa and the provincial parliaments of Quebec and Toronto canvassed a multitude of issues from climate change, and, of course, their modelling of an emissions trading scheme, and the need to work with the

       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured to meet with the Hon. Peter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKay" rel="nofollow">
         MacKay
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_National_Defence" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , where in discussions I raised the question of why there was to be a withdrawal of their troops from Afghanistan in 2011. He detailed to the delegation, just days after the loss of 21-year-old trooper Karine Blais, the difficulties in explaining to his nation why Canadians, in particular a young Canadian woman, should be laying down their lives for a country where the government wants sharia law, which denies equal rights to women. Australia is well served by His Excellency Mr Justin Brown,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

        to Canada, and his highly effective team. I thank them for their efforts, both individually and collectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        I need to make it clear that the delegation’s visit to Mexico was undertaken in full knowledge of the outbreak of the H1N1 virus and the threat assessments provided at the time. Our diplomatic relationships with Mexico started 43 years ago, and it was the view of the delegation that it was important to show by our visitation solidarity and concern for the health of the people of Mexico and support for the work that was being done to contain the spread of the disease in very difficult circumstances. Despite the difficulties, productive meetings were held in Hidalgo, discussing trade and investment opportunities, and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City" rel="nofollow">
         Mexico City
        </a>
        with a range of government officials. The relationship and a sign of appreciation were reflected in the standing ovation to the delegation as we introduced by the President on the floor of the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The energy sector in Mexico is an important element in our trade relationships, with increasing opportunities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        and coal. I would like to acknowledge the hard work that has been done by Her Excellency Ms Katrina Cooper, Ambassador to Mexico, and her team in providing opportunity and success for my region in continuing to provide coal to Mexico. Ambassador Cooper recently visited Australia, and it was an honour to organise, through the generous hospitality of Xtrata, a visit to both open-cut and underground mining operations, so that, when she speaks of Australian coal, she can speak from the visualisation and understanding of the industry firsthand. At dinner meetings with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Business Association
        </a>
        of Mexico,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        , I witnessed the strength of our business relationships with Mexico, adequately fostered by our ambassador.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a nation, we are indeed very fortunate to have professional and passionate officers of the

        in our overseas missions. Overall, I was duly impressed with the dedication, direction, accomplishments and networks of our mission staff. I thank them all for their efforts in ensuring that the visit was a success. I also thank the members of the delegation—delegation leader, the Hon. Senator
