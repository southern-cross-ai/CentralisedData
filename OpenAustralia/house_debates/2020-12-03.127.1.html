       <p>
        Geelong is defined by the beautiful bay on which we are located, after which my electorate is named:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corio_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Corio Bay
        </a>
        . For as long as I've been here, I've been advocating for a walking path from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Park
        </a>
        , Limeburners Point, through to Limeburners Lagoon on the northern side of Geelong and the Hovell Creek linear path. This would be a unique walkway which would be absolutely stunning in the context of our nation. It would give a fantastic depiction of Geelong and would be a place of recreation for people throughout our city.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the features of that part of the path which exists right now, and it progresses around the bay, are the unique bollards which were first commissioned by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        from artist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Jan Mitchell
        </a>
        in 1995. These bollards depict famous people in Geelong's history and famous scenes. For example, there's a bollard of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Flinders" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Flinders
        </a>
        , who first climbed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Yangs" rel="nofollow">
         You Yangs
        </a>
        next to Geelong as he was surveying Australia back in 1802. There is a depiction of lifesavers at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Beach
        </a>
        , which is an iconic part of Geelong and is an area that I think should be on the National Heritage List. There is a bollard of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lalor" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Lalor
        </a>
        , who is famous, of course, for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_Stockade" rel="nofollow">
         Eureka Stockade
        </a>
        , but, after that, he found sanctuary by living in Geelong.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harrison" rel="nofollow">
         James Harrison
        </a>
        , one of the first inventors of refrigeration, is perhaps Geelong's most noted citizen. He also established the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Advertiser" rel="nofollow">
          Geelong Advertiser
         </a>
        </i>
        back in 1840. There's a bollard dedicated to him, as there is to a Koori hunter, and the list goes on. They are a fantastic part of the walk.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the Balmoral Quay apartments development next to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rippleside_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Rippleside Park
        </a>
        , which is halfway along the walk, we have seen the walk extended continuously from Eastern Park through to Mackey Street. There's a way to go to achieve my dream of getting it right around the bay to Limeburners Lagoon, but it is a significant part of the walk that has now been extended. Currently the bollards only go to Rippleside Park. It would be great—and I call on the City of Greater Geelong today—to extend the program of art with the unique bollards beyond Rippleside Park, past the Balmoral Quay apartments and right through to Mackey Street. It would provide an opportunity to celebrate more of Geelong's history and to make those bollards the critical feature of these paths. A starting point would be to have a bollard dedicated to Graham 'Polly' Farmer, the great footballer of Geelong's history, who played 101 games for Geelong, who revolutionised the way in which handball occurred and who died last year. It would be a great tribute to him, and it would be fantastic for Geelong's walk.
