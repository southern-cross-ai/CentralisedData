         Health and Ageing

         I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I am happy to inform him and the House that the government’s broader health cover legislation has just passed through the parliament. That is very good news for the 59,000 people in Hinkler who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance. I confess that this is complex legislation, but there are two significant changes that it brings about. Firstly, the private health funds will be able to cover from their main tables out-of-hospital treatment that reasonably substitutes for or prevents in-hospital treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, the funds will be required to provide much greater information about their products, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Health_Insurance_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
          Private Health Insurance Ombudsman
         </a>
         will provide a comparative product website to enable patients to make more informed choices about the particular product which best suits them. Over time, these changes should mean that private health insurance is a more customer-friendly product, a more patient-friendly product, and that should build on the nine million Australians who currently enjoy the security and choice which private health insurance brings.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have to say that everyone knows where the Howard government stands on private health insurance. We believe that a strong private health system is an essential complement to a strong public health system, to a strong Medicare system. But no-one knows where members opposite really stand. What we do know is that, deep down, members opposite hate private health. Deep down, they hate private health, and if they ever got the chance, they would rip the guts out of private health insurance by abolishing the private health insurance rebate or by means testing.

          They say, ‘Rubbish!’ now. That is not what they will say when they have the chance to give a considered opinion. The member for Gellibrand, the shadow health minister, said that the government should spend less on private health and it should instead spend more on public hospitals. Do you deny that, do you? What did you say?

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. I would ask that the minister confine himself to what I said in the debate.

             ... a subsidy to the rich.

            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             ... a bonanza for the multinational insurance companies.

             Just last week in the Senate, Senator Sterle—who I believe is a new senator from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australian
             </a>
             contingent in this parliament—said of the private health insurance rebate that it was ‘a monumental failure’, ‘shonky’ and ‘a monstrous failure’.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is what those opposite say about the private health insurance rebate. How can they credibly expect anyone to believe that they would not rip the guts out of it if they had the chance in government? How can they say they support something which they are constantly criticising? What all this means is that, when it comes to private health, you just cannot trust Labor. I know that the Leader of the Opposition does not like being called
