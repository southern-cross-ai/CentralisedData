       <p>
        We are all very lucky to call Australia home. It is a country that comes with opportunity. It is a place where there is peace and, most importantly, we have respect for each other. Recently we have watched and heard about the horrors happening outside our borders, with international conflicts at the front and centre of our minds. In this challenging time, we must rally around the principles that define our humanity.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many of you know, I am a Buddhist, but I want to share a quote from the Bible that my constituent has asked me to speak to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself …
       </p>
       <p>
        Very simply, it asks that we learn to love our neighbours as we love ourselves. We are all human. We must learn to embrace each other and our differences, guided by compassion. We know that by working together we can overcome mistakes which have happened in the past and most importantly learn the necessity of forgiveness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken on the atrocities of war before and know that it is a foolish, foolish exercise. I have and always will advocate for peace. Yet so many within our own local communities are directly affected by global unrest—so many people crying for justice for the innocent. I wholeheartedly say this: there is no place in our modern society for antisemitism or Islamophobia, and racism has no home in Australia. As a representative of my electorate of Tangney, I know that we must build on social cohesion and safeguard the safety, security and wellbeing of our communities. In the face of adversity, it is easy to succumb to fear and division. However, history has shown us that unity is our greatest strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that Australia is a diverse, colourful blend of cultures, backgrounds and beliefs. We are a country that is blessed with multiculturalism. We embrace our differences, and all of us have come to this shore, by air or by sea, at some point in our generational time lines, looking to better ourselves and our loved ones. We must all work together to cultivate an environment that fosters understanding and appreciation for our differences. I will say this again: no-one should ever feel threatened because of who they identify as, be prosecuted for their religious beliefs, or be racially profiled or attacked just because of their looks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say this because I'm a proud migrant from Malaysia; I'm a Chinese man; I am a practising Buddhist, a husband, a father and a grandfather, but most importantly I'm someone who has been elected by the good people of Tangney to stand here in this House to speak out the voices of those who are often silenced. I stand here as a proud member of this Albanese government, which I know actively promotes and works towards unity, transcending differences that may otherwise divide us, regardless of our political differences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is not an isolated island in the sea of global affairs. I know as a government representative that we all have a role to play on this international stage in fostering peace and stability. Our country's diplomatic efforts have been intensified, advocating for dialogue, cooperation and conflict resolution, all in respect of international law. We act to not only safeguard our shores but also contribute to a world where peace is the common currency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, let us all commit to working together with our communities for better social cohesion, safety, security and wellbeing. This is not just a call for action; it is a pledge to safeguard the fabric of our society. Together, let us embrace the values that define our shared humanity. May we stand strong in the face of adversity, guided by the principles which I spoke of when I first got into parliament: peace, love, unity and respect. Together we can pave the way for a brighter, more harmonious future.
