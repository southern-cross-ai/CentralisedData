       <p>
        I am very pleased to share some exciting news from my electorate of Bonner. The notorious Rochedale Road roundabout upgrade is now fully funded. I delivered $14 million towards this vital upgrade in 2019 and have advocated, alongside the Rochedale community, to secure the remainder of funding through a joint project with the Logan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City
        </a>
        councils. I thank the member for Rankin for acknowledging my efforts, as this upgrade impacts on his electorate as well. Thank you to everyone who has joined the fight and signed my online petition to deliver a safer intersection. Thanks to the petition, and pressure from the

        candidate for Mansfield, Janet Wishart, and LNP candidate for Springwood, Kirrily Boulton, this vital upgrade will happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, both councils handed down their 2020-21 budget and have finally included the Rochedale intersection in their infrastructure budgets. I'm so pleased both councils were able to reach a funding agreement, and, alongside the $14 million Morrison government funding, we will be able to deliver the safety upgrade to the Rochedale community. The intersection of Rochedale and Priestdale roads is currently a single-lane roundabout located on the council boundary. It is a key intersection for the local community, as it is located in the middle of five educational centres and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to everyone who fought to fix the Rochedale roundabout. This is a win for schools, for students, for commuters and for the Rochedale community.
