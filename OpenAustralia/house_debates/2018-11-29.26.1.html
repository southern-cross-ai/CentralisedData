        It's no secret that my electorate of Braddon is home to some of Australia's best producers. In 1960, Blue Hills Honey, located in the far north-west town of Mawbanna, out in the hills behind Smithton, was the first Australian company to export honey to Japan. In 2004 they were the first Australian producer to introduce the industry-initiated B-QUAL quality program based on hazard analysis and critical control point principles. And in 2018 they've been recognised as the Tasmanian Export Awards winner, and are now a national finalist in the 56th Australian Export Awards, in the category of regional exporter. This successful family business of three generations is competing on the global stage and sending its products to more than seven countries. It increased its honey exports by 45 per cent in 2017-18, despite its production being hit by bushfires in January 2016.

        Blue Hills Honey is all about innovation. Their Japanese sales increased by 700 per cent after developing products such as honey-flavoured mouth spray, pet care products and single-use sachets. It's my great pleasure to congratulate Nicola and Robbie Charles and their staff for these fantastic achievements.

        But the Australian honey industry must be protected. The honey 'launderers', who are tainting the integrity and reputation of our honey industry by exposing consumers to blended honey, are infiltrating our markets, frustrating customers and producers alike. I call on the government to act on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">

        's call for Australia to develop an agreed approach to honey testing, and I call on this government to act now.
