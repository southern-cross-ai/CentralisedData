       <p>
        I love seeing the kids come in here and watch what is going on in parliament, but unfortunately a lot of schools in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        cannot get down here. But last week it was great, with the senator for the Northern Territory, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, and also the shadow minister for schools, Andrew Giles, for us to participate in the great work of the Parliamentary Education Office and, in particular, their Parliament Alive program. I want to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">

        and Marissa Beard from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for the great work that they do in making what we do here in this place interesting and meaningful for young Australians like those young students in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to share some of what those students had to say. One of their major concerns was for the environmentâ€”the need to recycle and look after our scarce natural resources. They also wanted more opportunities when they leave school so that they do not always have to go down south for study or work. And being 14-year-olds, they were pretty keen on some theme park action up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , so I am going to do my best to help them with that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the teachers who facilitated the programs: D'Elise Keitaanpaa from Moulden Park Primary School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Phillips" rel="nofollow">
         Liam Phillips
        </a>
        from Darwin High School, Anita Turnbull of Palmerston Senior College, and Serena Kuhl from Nightcliff Middle School. I thank the students, in particular the various prime ministers, leaders of the opposition and the speakers. I totally enjoyed taking part and I comment the program to the House.
