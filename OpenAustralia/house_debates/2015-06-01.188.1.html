       <p>
        It is with great sadness that I report to the House that a fortnight ago I attended the funeral of a wonderful local gentleman called Ian Hunt. Ian was a really important person in our community, and his passing, given in particular that it was unexpected after a very short illness—cancer—caused great sadness. Many people turned out to his funeral to pay respects to him and to his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian was a councillor for the northern suburbs of the Illawarra from 1995 to 2004. During that time, he spent two years as the Deputy Lord Mayor of Wollongong council from 2002 to 2004. He was very passionate about improving his local community. That can be seen by his service on the

        sporting precinct. He was someone who had a long and very proud history in our party as well. He held many important positions in the local Labor Party and was the president of one of my branches up until his illness and then, sadly, his passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian has left behind his wife and children. His wife, Judy, is also an active member of the party and the community, and I extend my condolences to her, his children—Leighanne, Jenelle and Brad—their partners and grandchildren.
