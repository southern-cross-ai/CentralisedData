        I would like to take this opportunity to speak about National Police Remembrance Day, which is held every year on 29 September. The day holds great significance for the police forces in Australia,

        because it is a chance for members of the force to stop and remember those colleagues who have lost their lives in the line of duty. It is also a time for the public to recognise the sacrifices that the members of our police forces make each time they put on their uniform to go to work. I was a police officer for nearly 25 years so I can relate to the challenging and confronting situations our officers face on a daily basis. I will always remember the first fatal motor vehicle accident I attended. Police men and women deal with so many heartbreaking circumstances everyday. They leave their own families at home to go out and risk their lives to protect others. This is why I join many residents in Macarthur who believe that the fine men and women in our

        deserve the utmost respect and admiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next Friday I will join residents at Campbelltown Police Station from 6am for a special memorial service and flag-lowering ceremony for National Police Remembrance Day. The event is well-attended each year; it is a great show of support for our young men and women who currently serve Macarthur in the Police Force. I encourage everyone in this place to attend the National Police Remembrance Day service next week as we pause to remember those courageous officers who have died in the line of duty. It is important that we also take the time to thank our serving officers for the risks they take every day to keep our communities a safe place to live. Lest we forget those who have sacrificed their lives.
