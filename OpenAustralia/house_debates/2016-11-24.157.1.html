        I know I am biased but I truly believe that my electorate of Dunkley is the most beautiful electorate in Australia. The residents in Dunkley truly have it good, with the best of the country, the city and the coast. So much of what makes my electorate a wonderful place to live is the natural environment, which I would like to talk about today. Places like the

        Regional Park, the Sweetwater Creek Nature Conservation Reserve, the beautiful cliffs and beaches of Mornington, and the beaches of Mount Eliza, Seaford and Frankston—just to name a few. My electorate of Dunkley has so much to offer the residents who call it home, as well as visitors to our beautiful area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had the privilege of meeting with many people and groups in my electorate who have poured their efforts into keeping our electorate the most beautiful electorate in Australia. On 22 September I met with Ella Boyen from Langwarrin, along with the Australian government's National Landcare Program, who assists in the maintenance and conservation of the Langwarrin woodlands and our local wildlife corridors. Ella does a fantastic job, as do many Landcare groups across Australia. On 9 August I also had the privilege to attend the

        As the member for Dunkley, I am very pleased to be able to support the efforts of local councils and the various groups and individuals in maintaining and improving our local environment. I recently met with the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Frydenberg" rel="nofollow">
         Josh Frydenberg
        </a>
        MP, and had the opportunity to discuss the importance of several environmental projects in my electorate. Minister Frydenberg and I also discussed the delivery of my election commitments, which have been supported by the federal government, towards the environment in Dunkley. These include in excess of $4,000 for several Green Army projects, including to clean up, revegetate and improve Kananook Creek; The Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve; Seaford wetlands; Baxter City Council boundary and railway corridor; the Mornington coastline; Boggy Creek, which runs through Langwarrin, Skye and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrum_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Carrum Downs
        </a>
        ; and Mount Eliza Regional Park. Groups like the Kananook Creek Association and the Boggy Creek association should be applauded for the wonderful work they do in our electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the opportunity to discuss solar power. In Dunkley, we are rolling out $100,000 for solar community buildings. This includes an the amount of over $10,000 for the Frankston Bombers football club and Baxter Cricket Club; over $8,000 for the Seaford Life Saving Club; over $12,000 for two projects for the University of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age" rel="nofollow">

        in Mornington; and over $6,000 for the Frankston East Tennis Club. For the Pines Football Netball Club we are contributing $15,000; for the Belvedere Community Centre, over $8,000; for the Langwarrin Tennis Club, over $10,000; and for the North Seaford Tennis Club, over $6,000. There will be over $4,000 for the Belvedere Park Tennis Club and over $4,000 for the Kananook Tennis Club and the Frankston Croquet Club. Last but not least there is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza_Cricket_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Eliza Cricket Club
        </a>
        , to which we are contributing over $10,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the campaign I was also very pleased to launch the Dunkley rail plan, which will see the electrification and duplication of rail from Frankston to Baxter. This will incorporate the station of Leawarra, which services
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_South" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Frankston Hospital
        </a>
        will also be considered, which would be great for serviceability of the hospital. Not only is it great for that but it enables people to come and see the local environmental assets in Dunkley. Particularly coming up to the summer period, I encourage tourists to come and see the lovely environment in Dunkley. Come and see what the best electorate in Australia has to offer by visiting—and staying—in Dunkley.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pass my regards and thanks to the former Minister for the Environment,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Hunt
