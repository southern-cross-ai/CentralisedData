        My question is to the Prime Minister. Over the 10 years from 2018 to 2027, what is the difference in dollar terms between the Prime Minister's schools policy and the policy under the previous, Labor government? Prime Minister, it is a dollar figure: what is the number?

           I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is not uncommon to ask ministers and prime ministers to compare policies. But it is unusual to ask me to compare our policy, our budgeted, fully-funded policy, with Labor's fantasy. Labor promised all sorts of things—27 secret deals, no transparency, no needs-based funding. Shaking her head, the member for Sydney is outraged. The outrage should be from her supporters, and every one of them knows that their position on education has been a complete hypocrisy. I will tell you what we are spending: $18.6 billion in additional money over the next decade. While the Labor Party are unable to say how they would fund it or whether they would fund it—indeed, the member for Sydney was unable to even promise to commit to funding it—the coalition has committed. My government has committed to precisely what

           recommended: national needs-based, consistent, transparent funding. Labor are not able to do that. They are wallowing in hypocrisy now, even as—

                  NDIS
                 </a>
                 . We heard from the Leader of the Opposition just before question time began about his commitment to the NDIS. Then he was unable to explain his extraordinary backflip. A few years ago he called on us all to support an increase in the Medicare levy to fund the NDIS but not to fully fund it. Now, when we have the chance to deliver on that vision, what do Labor do? They run for cover. Labor have no numbers. Labor have no funded numbers. I would say they have nothing funded.

                 When it comes to numbers, the real question the Leader of the Opposition should be asking is: what are the numbers of the member for Grayndler?

                  The member for Berowra will just resume his seat for a second. The level of interjections was ridiculously high towards the end of that answer. A number of members were

                  , particularly the member for Burt, who is now warned. I have warned two members: the member for Lindsay and the member for Griffith. The member for Lindsay continued to interject, so she will eject herself under 94(a). She can leave. Anyone else that is warned—
