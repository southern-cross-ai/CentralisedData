       <p>
        This evening I rise to talk about an event I attended on 4 September, the Formula One Technology Challenge. The event involves student teams designing and racing small-scale versions of F1 cars. The 11- to 16-year-olds taking part have to grapple with some challenging engineering concepts. I, along with the parents and teachers, was impressed by their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Producing high-quality engineers is fast becoming a WA specialty. There are 10,000 students in my electorate of Swan and many of them are taking engineering degrees. Part of the reason for our success is the support that engineering organisations give to schools in organising events like this. The F1 challenge is supported by the Re-Engineering Australia Foundation, and I congratulate them on their initiative. I am sure it will go a long way to developing a future pool of engineers in WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the event I was pleased to see that Streamline Racing from

        from my electorate of Swan won the senior title. Probably the most impressive entry was from

        by a group of young women who finished second in the racing competition on the day I attended. However, credit must go to all those schools, the students and teachers who took part in the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I was pleased to be appointed joint patron of this event with the member for Hasluck,

        , who happens to be in the chamber. It has been good to witness the progress of the competition and the students over this period of time. I am sure we will both do our best to support the event and encourage more schools to take part next year. It is a worthy competition and fostering an engineering culture in WA is a worthy pursuit. I wish the WA team all the best in the national titles in Sydney.
