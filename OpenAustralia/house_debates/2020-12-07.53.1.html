        A number of local school projects in my electorate of Menzies have now been completed with Commonwealth grants. These include air-conditioning for four classrooms at

        ; new shade structures at Donvale Christian College; a classroom refurbishment to create a recording studio at Donburn Primary School; a state-of-the-art hearing augmentation system at Eltham North Primary School; a fitness circuit at Kangaroo Ground Primary School; and notebooks purchased for

        This has obviously been a very difficult year for schools not just in my electorate but throughout Victoria. I would like to congratulate all those students, and their parents, who have coped with the difficulties of this year. In particular, I extend my congratulations to all the teachers, in government schools and in non-government schools, not just in Menzies but particularly in Menzies, for the increased work they have had to undertake this year. I know this from personal experience, because one of my daughters is a teacher at a local school in my electorate. I have seen firsthand the extra efforts that have had to be made because of the COVID-19 pandemic and I would like to congratulate all the teachers involved.
