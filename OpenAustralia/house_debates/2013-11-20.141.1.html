        by leave—A short time ago President Yudhoyono made a statement in Jakarta. I have to say that I was encouraged by the president's remarks about the strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia although obviously there are very serious issues which do need to be worked through in the near future between us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, I want to express here in this chamber my deep and sincere regret about the embarrassment to the president and to Indonesia that has been caused by recent media reporting. The president indicated that he would shortly be writing to me. I would like to reassure the House that I will be responding to the president's letter swiftly, fully and courteously. As always, I am absolutely committed to building the closest possible relationship with Indonesia because that is overwhelmingly in the interests of both our countries.

        <p>
         by leave—We agree with the Prime Minister of Australia there is not a more important relationship than with Indonesia. As I said yesterday in this place, the opposition believes that our relationship with Indonesia can recover and it can thrive and prosper. What the government and the opposition must continue to do is to unite in our commitment to improving and repairing this relationship in a timely way.
        </p>
        <p>
         This parliament, all of us, respects Indonesia as a successful democracy. A strong and constructive relationship is fundamental to our national interest. It is particularly fundamental to the work that we do to help stop people smuggling, to improve regional security and the strong trade and to the business interests between our two countries. That is why our position continues to be one of support for the government. The days ahead remain of the utmost importance and these matters should continue to be resolved.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not underestimate the seriousness of this matter or the sense of offence that our Indonesian friends are feeling. We will support the government in these efforts. As I said yesterday in this place, it is impossible to imagine our futures without a positive and constructive friendship and dialogue between our governments. That is why, again, I reiterate on behalf of Labor: we want the government to be successful in rebuilding the relationship and trust with Indonesia. We will support the government in its efforts. This is indeed a 'team Australia' moment. This is something that is happening to both Indonesia and Australia. We need to walk this road together. Other nations have resolved these similar issues. We can too.
