       <p>
        Earlier this year, I was honoured to be appointed patron of the North Sydney
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-Branch. As someone who has never served in uniform, it was a humbling experience to be asked to be patron for a group of men and women who have fought for our nation and whom I admire greatly for all they have done for Australia. I was also honoured to serve as patron alongside Robert, or Bob, Clark, who served in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and was a leader in the veteran community. I was very sad to learn that Bob fought his final battle last weekend. I pay tribute to his contribution to Australia in this, its parliament.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Clark" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Clark
        </a>
        was born and raised on the lower north shore of Sydney. He was of that generation who did not hesitate to answer the call of service when our nation and the very democratic values that define us were under threat. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        , he served in the 2/5th Independent Company, which was formed in 1942. The 2nd/5th saw action in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        and its commando squadrons led reconnaissance missions and raids against the Japanese as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanga_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Kanga Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as he served his nation in war, Bob continued to work for his community. He was particularly proud of his role as a volunteer fireman in Willoughby, where he served for 25 years. He became actively involved in the veteran community, particularly through the Anzac Club in Cammeray and the North Sydney RSL Sub-Branch. He served as its president and more recently as its patron and was awarded life membership.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Bob's family including his four children and to his many friends in the veteran community I extend my sincerest condolences. Bob Clark, your service to Australia will not be forgotten.
