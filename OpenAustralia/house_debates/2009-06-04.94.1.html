        My question is again to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his answer to my previous question concerning representations made to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">
         OzCar
        </a>
        by his office. In his answer he stated that his office had received hundreds of representations which had been forwarded to OzCar. The evidence before estimates today by one of his own officials is that OzCar has received one representation for one dealership from the Prime Minister’s office and for only two dealerships from the Treasurer’s office, one of which we know was on behalf of Mr Grant. Which account is true? Was it hundreds or was it two?

         There would have been many, many representations to my office from members of parliament, and they would have been dealt with in a variety of ways. What you should do is go and talk to the Motor Trades Association about the deep interest there has been from car dealerships on this issue. By a variety of means these have all been referred on to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">
          OzCar
         </a>
         , which by the way is the subject of legislation that has passed the House but still has not passed the Senate. If you wish to call officials back before the estimates committee to find out how many phone calls there were, how many representations there were and what incoming requests for information there were, go for your life, but you are up a dry gully.
