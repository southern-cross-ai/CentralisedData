        My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Minister for Trade inform the House how education has contributed to our strong export performance? How does this compare with previous years?

         I thank the member for Page for his question. The member for Page would be well aware of the great export earning effort that is being contributed to by the education sector, given that

         is in Lismore in his electorate and has other campuses along the mid-

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2005-06 the return to Australia from education exports hit a record figure of $8 billion, rising 13 per cent on the previous year. That $8 billion earned for the Australian economy was through the export of education services delivered both onshore and offshore, in person and through the internet. Education services are now our fourth largest export earner—hitting a record—one of the top four export earners in 2005-06. It is an extraordinary result. It has been achieved not just by the universities in Australia—as I indicated, Southern Cross University is in the electorate of the member for Page—but by other educational institutions also exporting their services to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the last 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in export earnings from education—in fact, a 320 per cent increase. In 1996 export earnings from the education sector were only $2.5 billion. They have now risen to $8 billion. As I say, it is our fourth largest export earner. Australian universities now have enrolments from students from more than 160 countries across the globe. It is helping to build a larger critical mass in our universities in Australia. In 2005, enrolments from China alone passed 81,000 students, and enrolments of students from India grew 33 per cent to 27,500. These exports growing in key markets are not only producing export income; part of this process is developing key cross-cultural ties with many countries across the world. Offshore students being educated in Australian universities go on to be business leaders and political leaders in those countries. It stands Australia in good stead in terms of the relationship between ourselves and many of our near neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor says it wants to establish world-class universities in Australia. We already have them. Those students coming to Australia to get their education here are voting with their feet. They are flocking to Australian universities. So not only have we expanded our base of education export services in Australia but we are also providing a lot more education places in our universities for Australian students. We are building critical mass in our education system in Australia, particularly in our universities, and at the same time creating many more jobs in the Australian economy through our exports.
