       <p>
        Australians are under enormous financial stress, and the release of yesterday's Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey confirms their worst fears. Australians' living standards are actually going backwards under this coalition government. The number of Australians living in poverty in Australia has increased under this government, yet it refuses to countenance an increase in the Newstart allowance. The median household income has declined by $500 under this government; it's actually lower now than it was when the government came to office in 2013. Yet this government supports cutting penalty rates for workers who work in vulnerable industries. Young Australians are staying at home longer than ever because they can't afford housing. They can't afford to get into the housing market, yet this government continues to support the most generous tax concessions for housing investors in the world. Pensioners, families and small businesses are struggling with skyrocketing electricity costs; they've increased by 18 per cent in the last three years. Yet, after six years, this government still does not have an energy policy, and it has left climate change to the climate change deniers in its party. Australians are facing the longest ever commute times to get to work, but this government will not bring forward investment in roads infrastructure.
       </p>

        Australians are going backwards under this Morrison government, and the government's only answer is to blame Labor. They are asleep at the wheel. They need to wake up. The economy is floundering, incomes are stagnating and Australians are going backwards under the Morrison government.
