       <p>
        Summer is when we all come together with our family, friends and community to celebrate the year past and to look forward to the year ahead. But, for some, summer can be a time of isolation. Sadly, it is a time when suicide rates peak, a time that can be particularly upsetting when others are out and about playing beach cricket, surfing with friends or enjoying a barbecue with family by the beach. That's why there is no better time to reflect on the importance of mental health support for community members who may feel cut off or detached and to celebrate the local community organisations who go above and beyond to help others out. Organisations like headspace, men's sheds, community houses and our many sporting and arts groups do so much to bring people together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds play a key role in this space across the nation, particularly in my electorate of Corangamite. The Albanese government recognises this, and that's why we've supported 89 sheds with a share in more than $500,000 to continue to support health and wellbeing. I was delighted to visit the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Grove
        </a>
        and Barwin Valley men's sheds, both of which have received grant funding from the Albanese government to continue their support of the health and wellbeing of men. The Barwon Valley Woodwrights received $3,100 for a bandsaw, drill press and benchtop, while Ocean Grove &amp; District Men's Shed received $2,250 towards first aid training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal grants like these are helping men and boys find mateship and social support to help them stay mentally and physically healthy. Through these investments, men's sheds are creating more than just bookshelves and benchtop; they're creating a place where men can come together to share stories and talk about problems. So I encourage all men's sheds to submit for funding. Applications close on 23 February, and grants for defibrillators close on 22 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like men's sheds, local sporting clubs play a key role in this area as well, so I'd like to congratulate all our local clubs. Whether you have won a game or are pushing for a premiership, like the Barwon Heads Cricket Club, you all play a key role in bringing together our community and supporting all those who are struggling with mental health. So, to you, our amazing men's sheds and all the other fantastic groups across my region, like the surf life saving clubs and others, thank you. You give so much of your time to bring our communities together. I look forward to supporting you over the coming year.
