         Redland Hospital
        </a>
        offers incredible service to my electorate under difficult conditions, but the funding over the last three years from the state government has risen only 17 per cent overall, and that is half of the increase in health and hospital funding for other health and Hospital areas around Queensland. Why that is is something that will have to be answered by local state Labor MPs, but I want to deliver tonight unfettered the Facebook threads that reflect feedback from my constituents. My job is not to filter their opinions. I asked them yesterday for their verdict on Redland Hospital.
