        I rise to place on record my strong support for sporting clubs across the south-west of Brisbane and in the great electorate of Oxley. Today I acknowledge the efforts of hundreds of parents and volunteers who give up their time as coaches, as refs and as fundraisers to enable thousands of kids to participate in sport. Like many members, I have had the privilege of attending presentation and awards days. Today, I recognise two great clubs in my electorate: the Jindalee Jags junior

        club and the mighty Forest Lake Magpies Junior

        have been a stand-out club in our region since 1971 and are one of the few clubs to field girls teams in all ages groups, including a senior women's team. I am proud to advise the House that the club has more than doubled its size over the past four years. It was a privilege to stand alongside the club president, Corey Sells, and recognise the tremendous amount of hard work the players and the whole committee put in to make the club so successful. In particular, I was able to present the dual club person of the year awards to Nicky and Dee for their outstanding efforts throughout the season. As the proud patron of the Forest Lake Magpies, recently I was able to recognise and thank President Farren Dicker for showing how a great club is run.

        continue to lead the way in junior Rugby League in Brisbane.

        I will keep fighting for funding for both of these clubs and every other sporting club in Oxley over the next three years to make sure we keep supporting the sporting stars of today and the future. Go the Jags and the Magpies!
