        . Robert 'Bob' Kennedy was a talented businessman, a great supporter of the arts and a kind and generous man. I wish to extend my condolences to Bob's wife Cathy and his children Jason, Rachel, Shane, Mark and Tricia. In every way,

        truly was larger than life. He was talented and funny and kind. He excelled at everything he tried. Bob founded Robert M Kennedy &amp; Co Accountants. He spent 17 years as chairman of

        and almost 21 years as a non-executive director of the company. He served as chairman of the governors of the St Ann's College Foundation and as chairman of National Pharmacies.

        Bob was a keen and talented artist, established the Kennedy Arts Foundation and the annual, very generous, Kennedy Prize. Bob also had a beautiful singing voice and loved nothing more than bursting into song at restaurants and functions, to the surprise and delight of everybody nearby.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a wonderful supporter and friend to me and I know he was a mentor to many young business people in Adelaide. The number of condolence notices in

        since Bob's death indicate the kind of man he was and the broad range of people and organisations that he generously supported. Bob's legacy will live on through his work, through his businesses and through his wonderful family, and our thoughts are with them all at this very sad time.
