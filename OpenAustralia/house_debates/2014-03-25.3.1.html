        9000 Phase 5C Replacement Chinook Facilities Project, Townsville, Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to provide new and refurbished facilities at the Royal Australian Air Force Base Townsville, Queensland, to support the introduction of new CH47F Chinook helicopters for the Army. The facilities will be used by Army's 5th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Aviation Regiment
        </a>
        located at Royal Australian Air Force Base Townsville and will provide new and upgraded working accommodation, new maintenance hangars, storage and workshop facilities and a simulator building. The project is valued at $54.8 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        and includes the provision of facilities and supporting infrastructure necessary to support the new F model Chinook medium-lift helicopter by enhancing capability to provide efficiencies in the delivery of the capability through the provision of either new or expanded and modified facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This investment will bring economic benefits for local industry in the Townsville region over the next three years. The works are anticipated to generate around 50 full-time jobs over the life of the project. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in late 2014, with completion by mid-2017. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to remediate and upgrade its terrestrial communications network facilities and communications infrastructure at 282 Defence sites in all states and territories. Successive independent reviews have identified the need for Defence to substantially improve the management of its information and communications technology. Defence's response has been a series of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        reforms which will deliver significant business advantages to Defence by upgrading, replacing, standardising and rationalising its ICT network. Defence will use this opportunity to reduce operating costs and complexity, and provide new collaborative business processes for ICT users, such as wi-fi, mobile videoconferencing and remote accessâ€”very important. The project will include the provision of computer cabinets and storage, power, lighting, air conditioning, fire protection and security alarms. The project will also replace broken infrastructure and install fibre-optic cabling and connections to buildings. Defence will partner with Telstra to implement the transform network solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The upgrade is valued at $131.1 million plus GST. Funding has been approved by the government. The cost includes management and design fees, construction costs, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and an allowance for escalation. The works will bring economic benefits to local industry at the 282 locations. Defence's investment will generate job opportunities for local subcontractors over the next two years. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in mid-2014, and should be completed on all sites by mid-2016. I commend the motion to the House.
