       <p>
        For many years, regional communities in Mallee have lived through the frustration of bank closures in their town. In the four years leading up to June 2021, the number of bank branches fell by 25 per cent in regional and remote Australia. These closures and, in some cases, reduced hours are incredibly frustrating for locals, particularly for those who are unable to use online services to conduct their banking. Once again, we see regional and rural communities bearing the brunt of big commercial decisions.

        I have been contacted by many constituents who have borne the impacts of the bank exodus. Unfortunately, making the switch to internet banking is not simple for many older constituents, and often their access to these services can be hindered by poor connectivity. I'm proud to say that this issue is being targeted by this side of the House. The Morrison-Joyce Regional Banking Taskforce will bring together key stakeholders, including banks,

        , local government associations and other peak bodies, to combat the impacts of bank branch closures. This is a solutions based task force working towards pragmatic outcomes to benefit regional people. We want to improve and safeguard existing bank services and accessibility where branches have closed. This government listens to the needs of regional Australians and delivers real and practical support for regional communities.
