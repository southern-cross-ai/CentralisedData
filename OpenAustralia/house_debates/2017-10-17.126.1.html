        I rise today to speak on behalf of the more than 600 Tasmanian families who will be affected by an imminent $160,000 cut to the no-interest loan scheme in my state. This funding is being axed from NILS Tasmania because
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Shepherd" rel="nofollow">
         Good Shepherd
        </a>
        Microfinance, which oversees the scheme nationwide, has restructured the way it allocates its national funding pool. Rather than allocating funding by need, Good Shepherd will, from next year, allocate funding on a purely per capita basis, which drastically impacts smaller states like Tasmania, despite demonstrably higher levels of socioeconomic advantage and need for these services. NILS provides loans of up to $1,500 to low-income earners who receive a pension or hold a concession card. No fees or interest are applied to repayments. NILS can be used to access finance for things like a new fridge or washing machine, unanticipated dental costs, education services or a car repair. It can also offer microfinance to launch a new small business. Without NILS, many low-income families would be forced to consider signing up with high-cost payday lenders and rental schemes, and the difference in cost is astronomical. For example, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG" rel="nofollow">
         LG
        </a>
        eight-kilogram washer from a rental firm will cost around $2,500 over the lease period, with no ownership at the end. The repayments on a NILS loan would cost $874—simply the cost of the machine—and the machine would be owned. That's $1,600 not going into the pockets of payday lenders and rental schemes.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that NILS Tasmania is needed, because it's reaching double the percentage of clients that NILS on the mainland is. Little wonder, given Tasmania's historically higher numbers of low-income earners and people requiring income assistance. I do not want to be critical of Good Shepherd Microfinance; it is a non-profit agency doing very good work. But I urge it, in the strongest terms, to reconsider its decision to strip $160,000 from Tasmania.

        Meanwhile, I take the opportunity to remind the House that this is Anti-Poverty Week. The Tasmanian edition of the Salvation Army's

        </i>
        makes for sober reading. Some 72 per cent of survey respondents said they had foregone food at some stage to pay their rent. The Tasmanian Council of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Service" rel="nofollow">

        estimates 5,000 Tasmanian households have gone without meals in the past year due to financial stress—stress that is increasing, not coming down.
       </p>
       <p>
        In November last year, the federal government released its response to the final report of the independent review of small amount credit laws. These are designed to protect vulnerable people. I urge the government to look at these recommendations and, with stakeholders, implement these recommendations at the earliest opportunity.
