       <p>
        Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today—the Ngunnawal people—and the Whadjuk people of the Noongar nation, which Tangney is a part of, and pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. The seat of Tangney is named after Dame Dorothy Tangney. She was the first female senator in Australia's parliament and a proud Labor member. I am honoured to stand here today as the first Labor MP elected to represent Tangney in 39 years. I would also like to acknowledge my predecessor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Morton" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Morton
        </a>
        , and thank him for his service.
       </p>
       <p>
        My story starts in 1961. I was born and grew up in Parit Zing, Johor, Malaysia. I am the oldest among eight children. My family could not afford electricity or running water. We had to chop rubber wood to cook. The floor of our house was rammed earth. The roof was leaky, and our toilet was just a hole in the ground. My parents were uneducated rubber tappers. When it rained, they could not work, so there was no income to feed the family. My parents and the generation before them never went to school. I was lucky enough to be able to go to school. I felt immense pressure to do well. I studied very hard, knowing that life would be better for my family if I did well in my study. After finishing high school I wanted to study further but unfortunately could not afford university fees.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a child, I always dreamt of being a police officer. In 1980, I joined the Malaysia police force, as I always wanted to serve the community and help people. I enjoyed this career, but the salary was too low—not enough to support my family. So, after two years in the police force, I went searching for new employment, and I found the best job in my life—dolphin trainer!
       </p>
       <p>
        Dolphins are so loving and beautiful. They are cheeky and very intelligent. They can sense our feelings. I was with my dolphin friends for four years, before the safari park closed. I was very sad to say goodbye to them, but I was also happy that they were back in their home, where they belonged, wild and free.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was during this time, when I was a dolphin trainer, that I married my love, Chew Yong. She is up there. She is my wife of 40 years, and also my best friend and mentor. Without her, I would not be the person you see here today.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the safari park shut down, I started a supply and distribution business. That was quite successful, with operations across the country. It allowed me to provide a secure life for my growing family.
       </p>
       <p>
        My spirituality is very important to me. In my early 30s I decided to live as a temporary Buddhist monk for 25 days in northern Thailand. I shaved my head and took a vow of silence. I meditated and ate very simply. During this time I experienced absolute peace—peace that radiates from within. It was an important experience that I still reflect on, and I find peace in solitude and contentment in helping others.
       </p>
       <p>
        All parents want the best for their children. For me, education is everything. And I want my children to be better off than me. In 2002, my wife and I made the decision to emigrate to Australia, to give our children the best education and opportunity to secure a comfortable life. My children each received a great education at the public schools in Tangney, and they graduated from their local universities. They are now all married and have great careers. I love my children with all my heart, and I'm always so proud of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        After our arrival in Perth in 2002, we ran a coffee shop in the CBD. It was great to be working as a family. We had to learn a lot of words that I'd never heard of before, like 'flat white' and 'lamington'!
       </p>
       <p>
        2006 was a big year for me and my family. I reignited my lifelong dream and joined the WA Police Force at the age of 45. 2006 was also the year that my oldest daughter, Yin Wee, was diagnosed with cancer. Looking back, I don't know how my family and I got through that period. Every day I travelled back and forth between my intense police training, in Joondalup, and Fremantle, so that I could spend every waking moment by my daughter's bedside in hospital. I had to appear hopeful and joyful for my daughter and my family, even though I was crying inside. My daughter won her battle with cancer, thanks to our amazing system—all of this underpinned by the great Labor Party initiative we know as Medicare. I am eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses. For many years, my daughter spent her birthday visiting the oncology wards to express her thanks, in deep gratitude.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent more than 15 years in the WA Police Force. I was posted across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , servicing the community from Eucla, 1,400 kilometres east of Perth, to Karratha, 1,500 kilometres north, and back to Perth. Police officers have a most difficult job, constantly taking on stressful, undesirable duties that no-one else wants to do but must be undertaken. My brothers and sisters in blue bear a difficult burden. This difficult burden has a name: it's called duty. We start our day before our children or partner are awake. Once we arrive at the police station we put on our blue uniform and gear up and hit the road. We never know what situation will arise or what we'll be called to attend. It may be serious family domestic violence, a fatal traffic crash, an armed robbery, a pub brawl, sudden death, murder and many more.
       </p>
       <p>
        All these are common tasks for police officers. Police officers have often been abused, kicked, punched, bitten and spat on. They go from job to job, often thanklessly, dealing with so many difficult situations. They may be tired. They may be affected by what they have encountered. But whenever they receive a call, they turn up and do the job professionally without complaining. Then, at the end of the day, they return to the office to finish a big pile of paperwork before heading home to their families, keeping a brave face of normality from what they have experienced. And the next day they start the process all over again. This is the burden of duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to recognise the uniqueness of policing and the people who put their hands up to serve. I also extend my thanks and gratitude to all the front-line workers, like our nurses, doctors, carers, teachers and beyond. And I thank all of them, deeply, from the bottom of my heart and I want to advocate for all of you. I received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Police Officer
        </a>
        of the Year Award in 2020. I felt that I was where I needed to be: serving the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst my whole life journey is important, one man made all this possible. His name is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        . He was the Prime Minister of Australia when the Labor government abolished the last vestiges of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         White Australia
        </a>
        policy in 1973. He is a hero to me as well as to many. He introduced multiculturalism into Australia. Because of him, we can call Australia home. Because of him, I and many of the new MPs here in the 47th Parliament can be the faces and representatives of our multicultural communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was born as a third generation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
         Malaysian Chinese
        </a>
        , but I stand here today as a proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        elected by the people of Tangney as their representative in Australia's federal government. Western Australia is where I live. I note and cherish the achievements of our state Premier, Mr Mark McGowan, and the WA Labor team. Mark is a gentleman and a statesman over and above his position as a premier. Thanks to his leadership, WA is now the wealthiest state in Australia. In my eyes, Mark is a legend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's closest neighbours are those in Asia, encompassing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        region, China, India, Japan, Korea and many more, and it is important to note that our economic boost, especially WA's, over the past few years was from the Asia region.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a verse in the Bible from the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27 verse 10, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James" rel="nofollow">
         King James
        </a>
        version that reads, in Mandarin, 'Yuan qin bu ru jin lin'. The translation of it is, 'Better is a neighbour that is nearby than a brother far away.' This is the principle of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        , in the police terminology.
       </p>

        My youngest son,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ" rel="nofollow">
         DJ
        </a>
        , serves in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        , which makes me very proud of him. Well done, DJ. He's the one that gave me the pink lunchbox! DJ and I believe in peace, and we believe that peace can bring harmony and prosperity. You can see both of us; we are not fighters. We always smile and are happy. But, if our country required our services, we would put our life on the line for our country and its people. Like all of you here today, Australia is our home.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a very passionate about promoting peace. When I was young, my grandma and grandpa told us about their life experiences during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        —the cruelty and atrocities that Japanese soldiers imposed on the civilians when they invaded Malaysia. This event left a terrible burden on them. My grandma passed away at the age of 76, and she was still in fear of the Japanese soldiers, even on her death bed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Tangney, we have residents from more than 160 nations, with more than half of them having English as their second language. Many of the migrants who live in Tangney are from war-torn countries. They have emigrated from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Europe
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         Central Africa
        </a>
        , Afghanistan and many more. When I was doorknocking, many of them told me they came to Australia because they wanted to escape from war. They shared with me their stories and their struggles. All they ever wanted was to be with their family and to have peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        War comes with deep costs. War causes huge humanitarian, environmental and financial crisis. War brings suffering, pain and sorrow to many. There are 1.1 million Commonwealth war graves in 23,000 locations around the world. So many mothers, so many widows, so many sons, daughters and families have cried and mourned, senselessly suffering from unnecessary conflicts, generation after generation. The cost of war is too much to bear.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must learn from history. We must learn from those mistakes. I have been to so many community events and celebrations: Jewish and Palestinian, Tamil and Sinhalese, Burmese and Karen. People from countries with conflict now live together harmoniously in Australia. I am a firm believer that we must propagate peace not only in our communities but also in our neighbouring countries and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peace, love, unity, respect: these four words are simple but meaningful words to live by, and I choose to live by these words. I believe all of us here today want to see Australia as the beacon of peace in this troubled world. Beating war drums is a foolish exercise. I do not believe that war is the way to resolve human problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Words are not enough to express my gratitude, but, right now, they are all I have. With the indulgence of this House, I would like to pay my thanks in the first two languages I have learnt: Malay and Chinese. Kepada semua saudara saudara yang berada di Malaysia, Australia dan di seluruh pelusuk dunia. Terima kasih atas semua perhatian dan berkat yang telah anda sekian berikan kepada saya.

In translation: to all my friends in Malaysia, Australia and abroad, thanks for all your care and love. Special thanks to all who have reached out to support and help me in the Australian general election. Thank you!

       <p>
        And to all my army of volunteers, donors and fundraising team, you know who you are. I don't want to single out any person, because I'm so indebted to all of the help you have given me. I'm forever grateful to each and every one of you.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would not be here today without the support, understanding and encouragement of wife, Chew Yong, who is here today, my children—Yin, who is here as well, number 2; Artur; Kent Wee, Kai Yong, DJ and Diem—and my cute, cheeky granddaughter, Alina. She is not here.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the good people of Tangney, it is an honour and privilege to serve you, and I am determined to do my best with integrity, remembering the words of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
         Abraham Lincoln
        </a>
        : government of the people, for the people and by the people. I make a pledge on this day. I will never take you for granted. I will work every day to make Tangney a better place. I will be accessible and responsive. I will deliver on my promises. I will serve all of you with love, compassion and honesty.
       </p>
       <p>
        While my late parents may not be present physically in the audience today, I want to pay tribute to my hardworking mum and dad. I dedicate this first speech to them both. Ah pa, ah ma, kamsiah! Thank you, Mum and Dad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, my wish to everyone listening to my speech today is to speak in Pali language: Sabbe satta sukhita hontu, anomodantu! The meaning is, 'May all beings be well, happy and peaceful.' Thank you for listening.

This government's commitment to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full demonstrates our emphasis on correcting our wrongs and rectifying injustice. The Prime Minister's determination to enshrine a Voice to Parliament in our Constitution is a glowing example. This is because the

          Holt, the electorate I am proud to represent, is diverse in its geography and demography and in the people who have represented our community before me. I want to particularly acknowledge the contribution of the preceding member,

          I do not believe it is a coincidence that Holt and the Hindu festival of Holi differ by only one letter. Both symbolise people celebrating diversity and the shared belief in the oneness of all. However, while we celebrate Holi once a year, the diversity that characterises this colourful festival is observed in Holt every day. Six in every 10 residents of my electorate are children of parents born overseas and 40 per cent speak one among 161 languages other than English at home. Although it may take a little longer than this term to master each one, it is clear that when we walk down any street in Holt we are bound to bump into people who speak a different language at home or trace their family's origin to a place unlike ours. Yet what makes Holt and indeed Australia unique is that we Australians may differ in our pasts but are united in pursuing a shared future. Holt is among the youngest federal electorates in Victoria, as families choose the suburbs in my electorate to raise their children in a community that is safe, supportive and welcoming. Our community is a home for people who strive toward ensuring that their children have a better life than they did, like my parents, Bernie and Humesh.

          My life is built on the Australian values of migrating for a better future, giving everyone a fair go and, most importantly, supporting each other as one big family. After being high school sweethearts since the age of 13, Bernie Rodrigo and Humesh Fernando celebrated their most memorable day at

          in the Colombo suburb of Dehiwala 38 years ago. They were blessed with three children: my elder sister, Candice, who I am sure is smiling down at me from heaven; Cassandra Juanita, undoubtedly the most mischievous out of the three; and my younger brother, Hamish, who is as proud of this day as I am.
         </p>
         <p>
          My fond recollections of Dehiwala include my incredible, generous grandparents, Clifford and Emerald, whose warmth, love, humour and food assured contentment and happiness. To this day I am still in awe of my parents' determination to achieve a better life for their children and the courage to act on it. The decision to uproot the lives of your family and move to a land across the ocean, where people are different to you, is daunting. It was a hard one for my parents and a harder one for Hamish and I. Nana and Papa were our best friends, our favourite teachers and our most enthusiastic playmates. Leaving the people who fulfilled any of these roles is difficult; leaving those who fulfilled all of them is unthinkable. The memory of landing in Melbourne on a cold July evening in 1999 is permanently etched in my mind. Little did I know the difference in weather would in fact be the mildest shock I would encounter in my new homeland.

          Knowing that we could always call this wonderful country home only encouraged us to do better with each passing day. Australia has given my family and me a home, a community and a purpose. There is no honour more profound than serving my fellow Australians.

          Australian democracy has weathered ups and downs due to our indisputable support of education for all. Universal education is a pillar upon which our society rests. It is the force that provides all Australians the opportunity to achieve their potential and contribute to our shared success as a nation. While education is everyone's right, I know too well that it is not something to be taken for granted. After I had a semester at St Gerard's Primary School in

          in the same suburb. At the time, it was hard to make ends meet for the Fernandos and keeping up with the cost of my education was difficult. Upon request from my parents, the assistant principal of Lyndale at the time, Mr Ian Mitchell, wrote to the department of education and successfully advocated for a fee waiver. I remain grateful for Mr Mitchell's effort and I cannot overstate the importance of my teachers in making me who I am today. A huge shout-out to Mandy Tassel, Richard Japie, Krista Rainsford and

          Today, I am in this chamber to be the voice for Australians who are having it tough, like I once did. I am here to fight for those who cannot take for granted the things that we do. I will never forget that my parents did not have to choose between keeping their daughter well fed and educated, because in our country we believe everyone, no matter their wealth, immigration status or family background, must be supported to reach their full potential. I put my hand up to be a member of the House of Representatives to ensure that we, as parliamentarians, will always look out for those less fortunate than ourselves so that one day they will look out for those less fortunate than them. This is the Australian way; these are the values that we cherish as Australians.

For decades, our thriving TAFE sector has given us the opportunity to gain experience and upskill ourselves. Addressing the sector's funding shortages will support Australia in meeting present and future demands in this rapidly-changing world.

          with my mother's best friend, Aunty Sujatha. She spoiled Hamish and I by paying a Woolies bill of $500 on the condition that we promised to study hard. Aunty Sujatha, I will never forget the joy you brought to us that day. Little did I think that the supermarket chain would have such a special connection with my life. For 15 years, since I was 15, I stacked shelves, baked pastries and bagged groceries at various Woolies stores across the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Those years as a Woolies employee also fostered my passion for ensuring that essential workers are treated with care and dignity.

          My involvement in the union movement paralleled my involvement in retail. I became a member of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association on my first day at Woolworths. At the time, my knowledge of the vast world beyond friends, family and community was limited to the occasional glance at the news and receiving a copy of the

          focused on the consequences of the Howard government's disastrous industrial relations plan,

          It was this period, I believe, that put me on the course that resulted in my election to the House of Representatives. Realising the impact of government policies on my ability to earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, I understood that being a union member alone was insufficient. I knew it was time to advocate for millions of Australians like me who spent many hours on the shop floors of supermarkets, fast-food chains and warehouses. As the years progressed, the time devoted to strengthening our labour movement increased.
         </p>
         <p>
          After serving as a delegate and as a health and safety representative, it was time to dedicate myself to the union movement around the clock as a union organiser. Many on this side of the chamber will know that being a union organiser is an experience like no other. Over the five years that followed, every day was different and every interaction was unique. Between the long and irregular hours, during which my office regularly shifted between my car and the tearooms of the stores I visited, knowing that I made a small yet meaningful difference to my former colleagues was rewarding. This meant ensuring that Sharon, a 70-year-old carer with poor eyesight, was afforded a roster that accommodated her caring responsibilities and health requirements, or supporting Lucy, a young lady with special needs, in her successful appeal to overturn a wrongful termination during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. My time as an organiser had such an incredible impact on my life that I still catch myself referring to the people I represent as my members!

          Our workplace laws affect every Australian. I joined the Australian Labor Party because it is the party of the working people. When jobs are at risk and wages decline, the nation looks to those in Labor to fix a system failing to protect them from exploitation. Labor governments have been responsible for cleaning the mess left behind by those on the other side of this chamber. I am honoured to support a government that will continue this proud tradition of delivering a better future for every Australian worker.

          My family's success as a family is not our own. We were fortunate to migrate to a country where community organisations are strong and supportive. My awareness of this fact dates back to my very first Christmas in Australia. We encountered financial difficulties in our early years, and this meant my brother and I would have celebrated our first Christmas in Australia without any gifts. However, the

          Holt abounds with examples where community has filled the gaps to ensure that no-one falls through the cracks. Among the earliest of them is the founding of the Cranbourne Golf Club, which ensured Melbourne's Jewish community could enjoy a game of golf free from discrimination faced at other venues. Of course, the past 2½ years have presented us with challenges that occur only once in a lifetime. I am proud of the diligent organisations in our community for helping to address each one. This includes: the role of welfare organisations like Community Information and Support Cranbourne,

          My utmost respect is reserved for that indispensable pillar of our society that has protected and upheld the safety and dignity of every working Australian: the union movement.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Donovan" rel="nofollow">
           Michael Donovan

         </p>
         <p>
          I also want to thank two champions of SDA Victoria who are here today: assistant secretary Mauro Moretta, for his wise counsel and dedication; and state president Julie Davis, for continuously supporting my participation in the union movement since my first day at Woolworths Dandenong Plaza. I extend my gratitude: to Radha Nair, Manny Zouros and Aleksandar Velanovski, for being my best friends—thank you for always supporting me and encouraging me to believe in myself; to Dean D'Angelo, for checking up on me every day and being with me from my first door knock to my swearing-in; to Michael Galaea, Kimi Singh, Emma Mattoo and every staff member at SDA; and to my federal colleagues Senator Raffaele Ciccone and Dr Daniel Mulino, for teaching me the ropes and making sure I no longer get lost on my way to Aussies!
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, I also want to remember my dearest friend, Darrell, who I miss very deeply. Darrell, I know you are watching from above and I hope I have made you proud.
         </p>

          I have learnt so much from my involvement in the union movement, and I do not think I can express my gratitude enough for the people who have supported me along this journey. I want to thank all local

          My message to everyone is simple. Two decades ago, I was a little girl trying to figure out life in a new country, and I did not even dream of being here. I honestly pinch myself thinking that this is my life now. Australia's greatest strength is its ability to support every Australian in achieving the life we want, if we are determined and prepared to work hard for it. It is our responsibility as Australians to provide each other the support to make it happen. I am grateful for the opportunity bestowed upon me. I will use this time in this place to inspire the people of Holt to put their hands up to be the representatives of our community in every possible way. I thank the House.
