       <p>
        With 2022 fast drawing to a close, I want to share with all of you in this place just a few highlights from the year representing the constituents of Wills.
       </p>
       <p>
        In January I heard from Glenroy residents and local business owners about the issues that matter most to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        February was a busy month of parliamentary sittings, but I managed to get out and cook a few snags at the Coburg Bunnings barbecue to support a wonderful charity, the Moreland Toy Library, and I had a hit of tennis at the Moomba Park Tennis Club open day.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March, local residents packed out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_Town_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Brunswick Town Hall
        </a>
        to hear from the then shadow minister, now the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        , on reconciliation and how a Labor government will deliver the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full.
       </p>
       <p>
        April was a great month. I announced a $500,000 commitment in funding to restore the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merri_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Merri Creek
        </a>
        , alongside the member for Cooper and the passionate members from the Merri Creek Management Committee and Friends of Merri Creek.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May, of course, was the election campaign, and on election day I was honoured to be re-elected as the member for Wills as part of the Albanese Labor government. I want to thank everyone in my community again for their support and for again placing their trust in me to serve as a local MP and to deliver for our community as part of a federal Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June we were back at work, visiting the 5th Brunswick Scout Hall to congratulate Mitchell Gunthorpe on receiving his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout
        </a>
        badge, the highest award a Venturer Scout can receive.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July was Refugee Week. I celebrated that at the Multicultural Hub in Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p>
        In August I spoke at the opening ceremony of the Myanmar National Unity Government representative office in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        In September I had the honour of being elected chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        . This is something that's been a great privilege. It is a great privilege because I have worked for my whole career in the service of Australia's national security and prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        In October I, with the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Childhood_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Early Childhood Education
        </a>
        and Minister for Youth, paid a visit to Lake Park Kindergarten, a bilingual kindergarten in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coburg" rel="nofollow">
         North Coburg
        </a>
        . Dr Siobhan Hannan, an experienced early educator, showed us around and the kids taught us a few words in Italian.
       </p>
       <p>
        In November I spoke at the African Festival at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Fed Square
        </a>
        and had a dance—please don't watch the video! I celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Cyprus Community of Melbourne and Victoria, a great local community of long standing—90 years. And I delivered on the Albanese Labor government's election commitment of $25,000 to support the Anatolian Alevi Festival at Coburg Lake.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that we're coming up to December, I want to wish everyone in my electorate of Wills a safe and happy festive season, a happy Christmas and a happy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         New Year
        </a>
        . I look forward to 2023 and continuing to serve and deliver for our local community.
