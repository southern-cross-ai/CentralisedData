       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today the member for Bennelong repeated his call for reform of capital gains tax and negative gearing. If the Prime Minister will not listen to first home buyers, will he at least listen to a member of his own back bench saying the system needs to be reformed? Why does the Prime Minister refuse to simply say whether he rules out changes to capital gains tax or not?

         The finance minister dealt with that this morning and Sabra Lane dealt with the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. What a pathetic performance—could not even say what his renewable energy target would cost, just like he had no idea what his negative gearing policy at the last election would do to housing prices. The reality is—

           It is perfectly obvious the Manager of Opposition Business has no interest in the standing orders but plenty of interest in interrupting the way in which we are revealing the absolute shallowness of the Labor Party's policies, their recklessness, the damage they are doing to Australian families and households. Spare us the fake empathy, if you please. Every member opposite knows there are businesses and jobs in their electorate which their policy puts at risk, and none more so than the members from the

            Hunter Valley

           . The member over there, the member for Hunter, represents an electorate, the jobs in which are based on energy, on affordable energy, on strong, reliable baseload power, and he is a member of a party that wants to shut it all down.

               While coal is still a vital source of employment, we are a region in transition. Just as nearby Newcastle has blossomed beyond steel, the Hunter will transition from coal to newer, cleaner industrial bases.

               What are they going to be? Is it going to be gas at $100 a megawatt hour? Ask the people at Tomago Aluminium. Ask them whether they can afford $100 a megawatt hour. What is the Labor Party's plan? We are putting in place energy storage. We are taking on the challenge of providing the storage and the backup that Australia's energy system needs.

They will choose how often they are in the chamber. Many have worked very hard to get in the chamber. It surprises me they then work so hard to get themselves out of it once they are here.

                 Thank you, Mr Speaker. This issue of energy is all about competence. It is about competence and Labor's incompetence, its failure to put in place a plan.

                  The Prime Minister needs to bring himself back to the question of tax in the remaining time.

                   Thank you, Mr Speaker. There is no bigger burden on Australian households than Labor's effective tax on energy, which they are imposing, and it is a tax levied by Labor incompetence.
