       <p>
        On Friday, I attended the 2015 Hunter Manufacturing Awards in Newcastle. I would just like to take the opportunity today to recognise a number of the award winners. The awards are in their 11th year now and a terrific way to promote and recognise excellence in manufacturing in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The manufacturer of the year award went to mining equipment manufacturer WEARX. The Hunter Manufacturing Awards' board award was presented to Portable Safety Cam for their innovative wireless safety camera system. Nicolas Percy from the Varley Group won the 2015 rising star award for being on the forefront of a range of significant projects and innovations. The apprentice of the year award was awarded to Brock Goodwin, who is employed by Hunternet Group Training Company.

        The excellence in innovation award went to
