       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Home Affairs is proposing fit-out works for new office space at 808 Bourke Street. Home Affairs currently occupies three buildings in the Melbourne central business district and surrounding areas. The leases are due to expire in 2023, with no options to renew. Under its Melbourne precinct strategy, Home Affairs will consolidate the three sites into one new location, allowing for operational efficiencies and reduced property operating costs. The estimated cost of the works is $34.3 million, excluding

        . The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 1 December last year. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction work is expected to commence in May this year and be completed in February 2023. On behalf of the government, can I thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry, and I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        Services Australia is proposing to undertake fit-out work at the newly leased premises at 205 North Quay, Brisbane, Queensland. Services Australia currently occupies nine buildings in the Brisbane area, many of which are approaching the end of economic life. Services Australia is proposing to consolidate these sites into fit-for-purpose office accommodation at North Quay, Brisbane. The consolidation of these sites is for office accommodation only and will not involve the relocation of existing shopfronts and services. The estimated cost of the works is $89.4 million, excluding GST. The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 1 December 2021. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out work and relocation to the new building are expected to be completed by December 2024. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
