        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's answer to my question in June where he committed to working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government on the flood recovery of devastated communities in

        </a>
        New South Wales. Can the Prime Minister update the House on whether the Resilient Homes Program will be offered to families in the Central West who have now been living in temporary accommodation for almost nine months?

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. We have had discussions with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . Indeed, the minister, Minister Watt, is convening a meeting of all national emergency ministers in the coming month. Just this morning we signed off on some further support for people who have been victims of natural disasters, to make sure that that support flows. We'll continue to engage with New South Wales, as well as with other state governments. I will report back. I will speak directly to the Leader of the National Party, because I know that he's very sincere in his commitment there.
        </p>
        <p>
         Frankly, the response has left communities, I know, in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">
          Central West
         </a>
         of New South Walesâ€”I've had discussions with the member for Calare about these issues as well. I know that, in Lismore, as well, there are still people doing it really tough, and there we had a whole program, for example, of buying out people who were on flood plains who shouldn't be remaining there, because they just couldn't return to those homes.
        </p>
        <p>
         These issues are complex. I will continue to work, though, with people across the chamber, as I do on these issues, and I will engage directly with the honourable member opposite.
