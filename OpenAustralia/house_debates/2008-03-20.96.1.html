        I rise to support the Augusta
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Tourism Association in my electorate of Forrest, which is in the final process of completing concept design and working plans for a $3.2 million redevelopment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Cave" rel="nofollow">
         Jewel Cave
        </a>
        near Augusta. The association is a not-for-profit organisation and the custodian of three show caves—Lake Cave, Jewel Cave and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Cave" rel="nofollow">
         Mammoth Cave
        </a>
        . It is also the custodian of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Leeuwin_Lighthouse" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse
        </a>
        and seven other caves which are not currently open to the public. The caves received 125,000 visitors in 2006-07. They are a world renowned tourist attraction and a great source of income, which is reinvested in tourism services and promotion and a source of local employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The preservation and redevelopment of Jewel Cave is primarily on environmental grounds to protect the asset and enhance the visitor experience. The redevelopment will be substantially supported by the group’s own funds, but to complete the project it will be applying for grant funding from various bodies and institutions. It has already been successful with grants of $500,000 from LotteriesWest, $60,000 from the South West Development Commission and $23,000 from the federal government’s Envirofund. The Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association has been working for more than a year with the South West Area Consultative Committee and the federal government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transport_and_Regional_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Transport and Regional Services
        </a>
        on a Regional Partnerships grant for $810,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        This important project deserves support. The Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association has proven ability to manage large projects and redevelopments, having previously managed many projects partly funded by grant moneys, including major works. The beneficiaries will be: the people of WA and the Margaret River region, in preserving and maintaining one of their state’s natural assets; the tourists to the area who will have an improved visitor experience; the tourism industry, which will benefit from the increased number of tourists; the local community, with the creation of new jobs; and the Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association, with maintained and hopefully increased income which, in turn, will be used to promote tourism to the area and provide better tourism services and attractions. Given the growth in the buoyant region in the south-west, one of the nation’s fastest and highest growth areas, the economy has experienced rapid industrial and residential growth. WA visitors contribute nine per cent to the national tourism market. I strongly support the Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association in their project and funding application.
