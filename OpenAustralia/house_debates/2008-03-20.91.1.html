       <p>
        I want to talk today a little bit about the campaign for the election of 24 November. During my first speech I paid tribute to a number of people who supported me over a number of years. I would also like to make mention of a list of people to whom I could not, because of the time constraints of that first speech, give due regard. In particular, I would like to mention a sad and tragic event that occurred within the Liberal Party branch of my opponent during the campaign. Cherie Adams, who was a former staff member of the retiring member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Elson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , as well as an active campaign team member for the Liberal Party and wife of local branch stalwart
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Adams" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Adams
        </a>
        , died suddenly at her desk. Cherie Adams was a long-term loyal Liberal Party member with whom I had had a number of discussions during the time leading up to the campaign. While passionate about her politics, she was always polite and respectful. I would like again to extend my sincere condolences to Richard and his family, but also to those who knew Cherie as a friend.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 15 March last weekend in Queensland the quadrennial local government elections took place. True to his determination, in a display of inner strength Richard Adams was elected as a councillor to the newly created

         Scenic Rim Regional Council
        </a>
        . For this I would like to further congratulate his efforts and ongoing commitment to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this stage I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate other successful candidates in the three local authorities that cover my electorate:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        Council and the new Scenic Rim Regional Council. At this point in time there is still some preferential work going on. The Gold Coast City Council mayor has not yet been selected. I would like to congratulate those two other mayors, the new Mayor of Logan City, Pam Parker, and Scenic Rim Regional Council Councillor-elect John Brent. These representatives have taken on a large task, and I wish them all the best and my support over the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the subject of community and friends, I would like to briefly list friends and supporters who gave so much in different ways during my campaign for election to this House: Senator Claire Moore;

        ; and Richard and Susan Heatherington. As I said, it was a long campaign for all of us. Life goes on behind the scenes, and I am paying tribute today to Richard and Cherie Adams—certainly to Cherie Adams, who unfortunately met a tragic end. All the best to that family, and all the best to those people who helped me in the campaign. Thank you.
