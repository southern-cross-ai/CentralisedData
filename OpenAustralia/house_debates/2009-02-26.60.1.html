        I would just like to clarify a point of procedure. In doing so, I want to assure the member for Herbert that I am not trying to embarrass him—he did the crime; he did the time. Earlier in question time, I directed the member for Herbert to leave the chamber for one hour. At the time, because he had so many things with him in the chamber—such as a computer and books—he took an inordinate amount of time to leave. But I knew he was not defying my direction. Pardon me for having to use this phrase this week: I let sleeping dogs lie. This became an issue in that the point in time that he left the chamber was recorded—and he may have sought advice about when he was to return which was actually different to the advice which, for instance, I would have received if I had asked. On this occasion I was quite happy to allow the member for Herbert to be involved in the division, but I would remind honourable members that the clerks note the starting time of the hour as being when the member has physically left the chamber rather than the time that the

         Mr Speaker, I would never knowingly return before time. I did check the draft minutes and I did return after the one hour on the draft minutes.

          I acknowledge that there was a difference in those two times. It may be better if, in the future, the member involved, on their return, liaises with the clerks at the table, just to make sure.
