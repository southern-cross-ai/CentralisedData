        My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. What initiatives to assist pensioners, carers and other Australians will come into effect from 1 January 2007 ensuring families in my electorate of Kingston and right across the nation are able to share in the benefits of our strong economic performance?

         I thank the member for Kingston for his very strong and passionate advocacy for the families in his electorate of Kingston, in areas such as Seaford,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallett_Cove" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         . He recognises that it is important that you have to do more than just speak about family values; you have to deliver for Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         From 1 January, many of the families in his electorate, and many from around Australia, will benefit from a range of increases to payments, such as the 366,000 people who receive the carer allowance. They will receive an increase to $98.50 per fortnight for that caring responsibility. Recipients of Austudy will have an increase. This will assist some 29,000 students, while 274,000 students receiving a youth allowance will also receive an increase. Twenty-one thousand single people under the age of 21 receiving the disability support pension will also receive a fortnightly increase. There will be increases to the double orphan pension and the mobility allowance. All of these are very significant and important additional resources and assistance being provided to these families, and it is a practical way in which the Howard government can assist them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also from 1 January, legislation ensuring a fairer assets test to those living in rural and regional parts of Australia comes into effect. Commonly known as curtilage, this very practical measure will help aged pensioners, carer payment recipients and the veterans community to be able to stay on the properties that they have lived in for over 20 years, where they have a close affinity with that land, and not have more than two hectares used towards the assets test. This measure alone will help some 10,000 people, who will benefit directly from being able to stay in the house that they have been a part of for such a long time, and not reduce their benefits through Centrelink.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, as the member for Kingston knows, the Howard government now is delivering over $16 billion in family tax benefits, another $9.5 billion over the next four years in support for child care and a range of other very practical measures on the ground assisting families, strengthening them through things such as the Stronger Families and Communities program. Our tax system under the Howard government is unapologetically supportive of Australian families. I say to the opposition and I say to all Australians that the Howard government do not just talk about family values; we deliver in a very practical manner to Australian families, providing them with the opportunities to build a better future for their children.
