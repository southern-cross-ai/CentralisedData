        Many people in our Greenway community know exactly who Sue
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Lawrence
        </a>
        isâ€”whether it is through her role as the head of the Riverstone Schofields Chamber of Commerce, or through her ongoing support of many fundraising campaigns, including Dollars for Dignity, or through her help during the 2021 floods where she coordinated a flood relief furniture and nonperishables drive for those affected. No matter how you know her, I'm sure everyone in our community can agree that Sue is a tireless champion in so many ways. She has rallied for better support for small business and for future planning in one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia. Her advocacy across Sydney's north-west is unmatched. She does it all with an innovative, solutions based approach. For instance, she has her sights set on a green space and town centre in Riverstone and the north-west to boost local businesses and create an even better community.

        During the most challenging of times for local businesses in an area like ours, which was on the receiving end of the harshest restrictions in the state, Sue was there for our businesses and our people. This year, on

        , Sue was rightfully recognised for all of this as the Blacktown City Council Citizen of the Year. What a worthy recipient! On behalf of the people of Greenway: thank you, Sue, for stepping up as one of our best-known local volunteers. Our community would not be what it is without you.
