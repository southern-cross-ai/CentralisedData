        My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science. Will the minister update the House on the policies and programs the government has in place to assist traditional manufacturers as they transition to new sectors and look to export new competitive and high-value products?

         I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and thank him also for the hard work he is doing in his electorate in the seat of Hindmarsh in Adelaide and the assistance he is providing at a personal level to encourage businesses to make the transition to the period after the car the industry ceases manufacturing vehicles in Adelaide.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know what a difficult period this is going to be. We all know the size of the challenge, but on this side of the House we are actually getting in there and doing something about it. Last week the member for Hindmarsh took me to a number of businesses in his electorate, all of whom are prepared to take on that challenge. Precision Components in Adelaide have a fantastic reputation in manufacturing components for the auto industry. They make bonnets and hoods, floor pans and all sorts of parts for Holden, Ford and Toyota. In fact they make parts for Holden cheaper than the country of origin, Korea, makes parts for the Cruze. They are a company that has made every post a winner, but they realise that they must change their business base if they are to survive after the car industry goes. Not only are they a great example of a successful business in Adelaide, but they are a great example of a business that is prepared to take on the challenge. More than that, they are a great example of a business that is prepared to use science to transition that change.
        </p>
        <p>
         And who are they using? They are using the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         . That esteemed organisation has provided them with technology—along with the federal government, who has provided them with $1 million—to produce a heliostat that is going to be installed in Japan. Here we have a company using technology developed by the CSIRO to actually build renewable energy projects in Japan with technology that is better than anything the Japanese can produce. This is in fact the second time that this technology that was developed by CSIRO has been used overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         What this shows is that, if you are determined, if you are not a doomsayer like that side of the house, if you are prepared to take on the challenge, if you are prepared to put science at the centre of industry policy, you can overcome the challenges of what will be one of the biggest transitions in Australian manufacturing history. We are prepared to do it; we are prepared to work with science and industry. Industry is prepared to work with science, and the government has got behind this company with $1 million to make sure it happens.
