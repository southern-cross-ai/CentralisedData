        Swim Macarthur are launching their 2015 campaign at the Camden Valley Inn in my electorate of Macarthur. The auction night and dinner will raise money for the cystic fibrosis swimathon that will take place at Wollondilly Leisure Centre on Saturday, 21 February. Over the past six years this event has raised over $400,000 to help find a cure for cystic fibrosis. It is hoped that this year's event will push that total to $Â½ million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cystic fibrosis is Australia's most common, life-threatening, recessive genetic disease. A child is born with CF in this country every four days. I am saddened to say that there are more than 80 people, mostly children, living with cystic fibrosis in Macarthur today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DA Global Swim Macarthur started in 2009 with one swimmer wanting to raise money for cystic fibrosis. Since then it has a made a huge difference in raising awareness and supporting those living with this awful disease. Until a cure is found DA Global Swim Macarthur will continue to grow and be supported by the goodwill and generosity of our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organising committee for their hard work and dedication in putting this event together. I would also like to thank the event's sponsors for their continued support because without it it would not have been possible to raise so much money for this cause. Last but not least I would like to thank the people of Macarthur for again showing that we are the kindest and most generous community in the land. Let us hope that one day 'CF' means 'cure found'.
