        My question is to the Prime Minister. I recently met Craig and Tamara, who are beef farmers in Cobargo, whose herd was devastated when bushfire tore through their property. They say they haven't been able to access the bushfire recovery grant. Why is the Prime Minister leaving people like Craig and Tamara behind?

         In relation to primary producer grants in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , they have been available in 49 local government areas, 2,236 applications have been received and 1,341 grants have been approved, worth some $84.6 million. In fact, what has been occurring with the primary producer grants is they've been running ahead of what our estimate has been for the provision of those grants to primary producers. There is certainly eligibility criteria, which I would think the Leader of the Opposition would think is necessary. When you provide any grant programs, there are eligibility criteria that apply to those grants. But I know that those primary producer grants have been incredibly important to those who have been able to receive them and have been eligible for those grants because it is assisting them as they're able to restock their properties and deal with the significant damage. It's some $75,000 that those grants apply to. I've seen firsthand their benefit across Australia, including in those communities that the member refers to. But I've also seen how they were applied in earlier times in relation to other disasters, such as the floods in

         . But the minister for agriculture has further information that he can provide to assist the member with his inquiry.

          Thank you, Prime Minister. I can advise the House that Tamara and Craig have in fact received a grant. They received it on 26 May. The Leader of the Opposition in fact tweeted on 27 May that they didn't receive a grant. This is a very serious issue. With all due respect, this is about us as a nation working together. We are making sure that we are working with state agencies that are rolling out these programs, ensuring that we support them. We will not blame the states; we will help them. In fact, we have done that so much so that we have put on nearly 30 additional National Bushfire Recovery Agency staff to get out there and be boots on the ground and supporting the states in rolling out the programs that we are asking them to deliver. We are happy to work with every level of government to identify anybody that might have fallen through the cracks. No-one will be left behind. This government has made that commitment to every bushfire victim. We will make sure the states and the federal government work together to look after our fellow Australians who went through one of the worst bushfire disasters in our nation's history.
