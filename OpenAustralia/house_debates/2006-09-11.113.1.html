        I rise today to speak on the sad occasion of the death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brock" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Brock
        </a>
        , Australia’s ‘King of the Mountain’ and motor racing icon. He was killed last Friday while competing in the Perth Targa rally near Gidgegannup. Peter Brock had motorsports in his blood. His great-great-uncle,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James" rel="nofollow">
         Henry James
        </a>
        , was a founder of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Automobile_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Automobile Club
        </a>
        of Victoria and organised Australia’s first motorsports event, the1905 Sydney to Melbourne reliability trial.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter made his racing debut in a homemade sports sedan, built in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_Glen" rel="nofollow">
         Wattle Glen
        </a>
        henhouse in 1967. He went on to win over 100 races in this homemade contraption. From then, his exploits on the track became the stuff of legend. Peter won nine Bathurst enduro races, winning in 1972, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987. He also won nine Sandown enduro races. He was Australian Touring Car Champion in 1974, 1978 and 1980, and he was runner up in 1973, 1979, 1981, 1984 and 1990. It was these outstanding results that were partly responsible for Peter being regarded as one of the greatest Australian racing car drivers of all time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other reason he deserved this title is that he always displayed standards of sportsmanship which are an example to all Australians. He was dignified in defeat as well as in victory. His contemporaries will tell you that this was the case both on and off the track. He never pushed his way around the track and off the track he never bragged about his exploits. Peter was a true gentleman. He inspired all of those involved in motorsport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter Brock gave much to Australia. He gave pleasure to his legion of fans, who watched his thrilling performances with great enthusiasm. He provided an example to all of us of excellent sportsmanship and courage. He and his foundation gave hope and support to some of the most disadvantaged in the community. He was a man of principle who, without fanfare or ego, gave so much back to the country he loved. Peter received the Order of Australia in 1980, which recognised his contribution to motorsports and also to road safety. Many of us think we are great drivers—and I borrow extensively from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Denton
        </a>
        here, who said this—but Peter Brock was better than all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as for his superb record as a motorsport champion, Peter Brock will be remembered for the Peter Brock Foundation, which is an enduring legacy of Peter’s life. His foundation supports many community organisations and individuals. In the foundation’s latest newsletter, Peter discussed the foundation’s activities and talked about the ethos of the foundation, which is ‘energy and caring’. He talked about heroin addiction and the depths of despair which addicts can reach. Peter said:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That’s why a helping hand dispensing some tools to repair the situation is what society needs. Not more condemnation or punishment. That’s why we created the Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation will live on and continue to promote Peter’s tolerant and humane approach to individuals in trouble and to make a contribution to the community. The testimonials on the foundation’s website from those who have benefited from the foundation are compelling and very good reading and I am sure that they are some of the achievements of which Peter was most proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would just like to finish with the Peter Brock philosophy, as he explained it to Andrew Denton, on the subject of respect. He said, ‘Respect yourself first and only then can you respect everything else.’ I know that all members will join with me in giving our condolences to Peter’s friends and family and to his children, James, Robert and Alexandra, on the tragic death of their father. Vale, Peter Brock.
