        One of the many joys we have all begun to experience again in a post-pandemic world is the return of the wonderful agricultural shows. We're well into show season in northern Tasmania, with the Launceston show held in early October while the fabulous Ringarooma School &amp; District Show was another roaring success this past weekend.
       </p>

        This coming Friday and Saturday, almost 5,000 people are expected to come through the gate for the Scottsdale Show, now in its 118th year. I'm delighted to be their show patron this year. This year Alice Hall is in the driving seat of the North Eastern Agricultural &amp; Pastoral Society and is the third generation of her family to do so, taking over as president from her father, Trevor, and her grandfather Lance, who was president from 1968 to 1975. 'It's nice to continue the tradition,' Alice told the local newspaper, the
        <i>
         North Eastern Advertiser
        </i>
        .

       <p class="italic">
        We always showed cattle and it was a family thing … This will be my 55th year exhibiting so if COVID hadn't happened it would have been 57 …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I've been on the committee for 48 years …
       </p>
       <p>
        As always, old favourites like cattle and machinery will be front and centre and of course, like any good rural show, it's only as good as the amazing volunteers who work tirelessly to put it together. As the patron, I'll be judging the pet parade and the Miss Tiny Tots, which fills me with a slight bit of dread as it may be akin to choosing my favourite child, but I will give it my best. Good luck for the Scottsdale Show this weekend.
