        . How is the Albanese government's enhanced Paid Parental Leave scheme just one way the government is making up for almost a decade of lost time in advancing women's economic equality and delivering for working families?

         I thank the member for Wills for that question. Of course improving paid parental leave is a critical Labor reform. It's critical for families, for women and for the economy. We know that, when it's done right, paid parental leave can advance gender equality and grow the economy. Modelling from Impact Economics and Policy showed that the establishment of the Paid Parental Leave scheme in 2011 resulted in nearly 75,000 more mothers joining the workforce and of course $8.5 billion to our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This is of course a proud Labor legacy from when we were last in government, and now this government is continuing to build on this legacy. In our first budget the Albanese government committed funding to improve paid parental leave. In our first year we legislated the first stage of our important reforms, meaning that from 1 July this year not only will more parents have access to the government payment but also they will have more flexibility in how they transition back to work and how they share care between them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since late March preclaiming has been open to families expecting a new child from 1 July. So far over 2,000 families have lodged a preclaim so that they can start to receive this entitlement as soon as their baby arrives. Of course, 180,000 Australian families will benefit each year from our more generous Paid Parental Leave scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         But of course when it comes to paid parental leave we're just getting started. Over the coming months the Albanese government will introduce further legislation that will implement the government's six months of paid parental leave. Of course, our significant boost actually makes up for nine years of wasted time by those opposite. Those opposite had nine years to improve paid parental leave and they wasted the opportunity. Quite to the contrary, they planned to cut paid parental leave and leave so many mums and dads without the support they need.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is only one side of this House that is delivering for Australian families, whether it's more affordable child care, better Medicare, cheaper medicines or, indeed, better paid parental leave. Actions speak louder than words. Those opposite tried to cut paid parental leave. We're getting on with the job of making it better for Australian families by expanding paid parental leave and making Australian families' lives better.
