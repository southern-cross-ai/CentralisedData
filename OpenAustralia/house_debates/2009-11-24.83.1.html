        On Friday, 27 November the 100th anniversary Wanneroo Agricultural Show will take place at the Wanneroo showgrounds. The first Wanneroo show took place on 21 April 1909 and was opened by the first Western Australian Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forrest" rel="nofollow">
         John Forrest
        </a>
        . That first show had some 500 visitors. In many ways it was a showcase for the produce and the livestock of the district. Wanneroo, of course, was a different place in 1909 than it is now. Although it is very much an urban setting in 2009, the links to the past remain strong. This is not more apparent than in the vibrant Wanneroo show.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we approach this historic moment I think it important that I make the first speech in the Australian parliament about the Wanneroo show and its importance. Before reflecting in some detail on the show, I acknowledge some of those who have served to continue the great traditions of the show. I acknowledge the Wanneroo Agricultural Society’s officials for 2009. The patron is a freeman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">

        , Margaret Cockman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Margaret Cockman and the Cockman family have a great history in the Wanneroo district. Her long-term involvement is literally part of the history of Wanneroo. This is not the first time she has been spoken of. I thank the former member for Moore,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Filing" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for doing so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge the vice-patrons, Bill Marwick and Michael Bock. Again they have had a long involvement in the district, and I acknowledge their work. The current president is Michael Aspinall. I know how much work he, the committee and all the officials have put into the 2009 show. I also acknowledge the key position holders: Graham Gibbs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Fulcher" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Fulcher
        </a>
        , Kathy Criddle, Vince Berlingeri, Bonnie Larmont, Roma Okely and Sue Morrissey. Although there are a lot of people who have in the past and who continue to make a significant contribution to the Wanneroo Agricultural Society and to the organisation and running of the show, time does not permit that they will all be named. I would, however, like to specifically thank David Lockett for the commemorative
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        he produced.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge Bernice Marwick, who accepted the

        team’s late entry for the big tractor pull event on Friday night. Apart from such drawcards as my team pulling a tractor, there will be a full range of show activities. In excess of 20,000 visitors will be able to enjoy the fireworks on both nights at 9.15; the Wanneroo Gift running events on Saturday; arena events, such as horse riding and showjumping; the animal pavilion; local produce events; sideshow alley; show rides; live performances; a multitude of stalls; and many other events. Standing second only to the

        </a>
        in terms of stature and attendance, I wish the officials all the best for the two big days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 100th anniversary Wanneroo show will be held on Friday the 27th and Saturday the 28th of November. It will be another wonderful success for the Wanneroo Agricultural Society and the Wanneroo district. I am surprised that this iconic local event—the Wanneroo show—has not been spoken of before in this parliament. I am delighted to do so on this occasion and demonstrate my strong support. Well done, the Wanneroo Agricultural Society.
