        I rise to talk about the serious issue of crime and antisocial behaviour in part of my electorate of Higgins and to propose a simple solution. My electorate is home to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Chapel Street
        </a>
        , an iconic strip well known for its shopping and nightlife. Unfortunately, escalating levels of crime, alcohol, violence and graffiti in the area after dark pose a threat to community safety and local businesses.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">

        crime statistics for 2008-09 reveal that assaults have increased by 18.3 per cent since 2007-08. Offences relating to drunkenness and indecent or offensive behaviour and language have increased by a whopping 236.7 per cent. This is something the local council, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Stonnington" rel="nofollow">
         City of Stonnington
        </a>
        , is rightly concerned about.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Stonnington has tried to address the issue by funding a month-long trial of a mobile closed-circuit TV surveillance vehicle along Chapel Street at a cost of $220,000. I understand that the trial has been successful, with several incidents identified by the surveillance vehicle having been referred to police. However, the ongoing cost of this service means it would be impossible for the council to fund this initiative long term.

        , also tried to address this problem by securing a funding commitment of $360,000 in 2007 for the installation of 10
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">

        cameras under the previous governmentâ€™s National Community Crime Prevention Program. This program was cancelled by the Rudd government and the cameras were never installed. Yet the problem remains. Chapel Street is well known for its bars and clubs and is a magnet for young people in particular socialising after dark. This is a good thing and we should encourage it. Our young people and their parents need to be confident they will be safe. However, there are valid concerns about alcohol and violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of planning applications for liquor licences in the City of Stonnington last financial year topped the state, and a number of these venues are in or near the Chapel Street precinct. There has been an increase in the number of assaults both on the street and in licensed premises. Fixed surveillance cameras would help ensure Chapel Street remains an attractive and safe destination, which is just one more way to allow the authorities to better deal with the effect of excess alcohol consumption and violence on our streets. The Chapel Street precinct would be an ideal candidate for funding under the Safer Suburbs Plan. Fixed CCTV cameras are an important deterrent for crime and antisocial behaviour. They can also aid the apprehension of offenders and provide evidence in cases against such offenders. I wrote to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        on 26 February to request funding for the installation of fixed cameras along Chapel Street under this program. I am looking forward to his response.
