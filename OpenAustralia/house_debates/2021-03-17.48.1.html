        , Probus clubs provide fun, friendship and fellowship to over 125,000 retirees who look to progress healthy minds and healthy bodies through social interaction activities with other retirees. In my time as member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I have seen the important role Probus clubs play. To see so many of our community's retirees come together, make new friends, listen to wonderful guest speakers and stay active is just so encouraging.

        Late last year, it was a Lane Cove
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probus_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        picnic that became one of the first community events I was able to attend after all those months of COVID restrictions. But many wouldn't be aware that the very first Probus club in Australia can be found in my own electorate in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Hunters Hill
        </a>
        . Celebrating its 45th anniversary this year, the Hunters Hill Probus club initially started off with an annual membership fee of just $1 and has prospered ever since. Meeting monthly, the Hunters Hill Probus club has speakers from all walks of life and regularly holds events such as barbecues and lunches; visits to galleries, museums and theatres; and travels across Australia to explore this great country. I understand they've been as far as Turkey. It's has a very active community led by club president Jim Likidis, and I know they are all dedicated to the club's success.

        Probus is a great organisation. I encourage retirees living in my area to think about joining. I'm sure you won't regret it. I want to wish the Hunters Hill Probus club a very happy 45th birthday and many more years of success ahead.
