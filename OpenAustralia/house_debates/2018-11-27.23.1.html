       <p>
        It was my great honour to attend the 100th anniversary of Armistice in the electorate of Lindsay on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . The event in my electorate was organised by the Penrith CBD Corporation in collaboration with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Penrith" rel="nofollow">
         City of Penrith
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        and Glenbrook
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches. I praise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Penrith CBD Corporation, Gay Hawthorne, for bringing the three branches together for this very special event. Ron Blakely,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wakefield" rel="nofollow">
         John Wakefield
        </a>
        and Mick McConnell, the presidents of all three of those branches—I can't imagine what it was like to come together as three RSLs to do that—pulled off a significant and very memorable event. It's been my absolute pleasure to support the committee through the $50,000 grant that we were able to secure from the federal government to ensure that our community had access to such a significant commemoration.

        It is fitting to acknowledge the struggles that we face towards reconciling our past on such days as Remembrance Day. I was able to give a speech that day and acknowledged, also, the 1,200 Aboriginal men who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        . It was the first time in their lives that they were treated as equals among their non-Indigenous peers. Sometimes we forget that we had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people serving, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Saunders" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Saunders
        </a>
        , who lived next door to Penrith in St Marys, was the first Indigenous soldier to become a commissioned officer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        . There are 42 wars active today, and in 2018 127,337 lives have been lost. On 11 November 2018, we made a promise that we will remember, and we will.
