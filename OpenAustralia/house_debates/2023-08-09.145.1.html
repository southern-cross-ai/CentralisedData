        Sporting clubs are more than vehicles for competition; they are families that recognise when some members are vulnerable and hold them in their loving embrace. Riley Byrnes was 11 years old and a star player of the Mitcham Football Club. He was sadly diagnosed with leukaemia in May 2022. After Riley found out he was going to lose his hair due to chemotherapy his teammates decided to shave theirs in support of him. With direction from Club President Matt McCubbin and Junior Club President Anthony Grace, the Great Shave for Riley was born, with local barbers volunteering their time. The captain of the seniors footy team went as far as auctioning his shave to the highest bidder. The entire club became involved and they raised an impressive $14,000 for the Royal Children's Hospital Foundation. The foundation is now using the Mitcham Football Club as a template for other sporting clubs and community groups.

        Riley, who was an essential player in his under-12s cricket premiership team and has had over 30 blood transfusions, became a huge advocate for blood donation, with the club rallying behind him. Sadly, we know that donated blood is always in short supply, especially platelets. This is why the

         Mitcham Cricket Club
        </a>
        , under the leadership of Vice-President Stephen Leslie, heeded Riley's call and registered the club for Lifeblood's local sporting clubs blood challenge. The junior cricketers ran for Riley and parents and members donated blood in droves. They were determined to make a difference and to honour Riley's journey, and they did. In the Mitcham Cricket Club's first attempt at this challenge they won the categories of most lives saved and most new donors and they tied for the category of most plasma donations. The Mitcham Cricket Club saved the lives of 114 people in three months with their donated blood, thanks to Riley's activism.

        I'm incredibly proud of the contributions of both outstanding clubs in supporting Riley and the broader community and I'm incredibly proud of Riley. He has shown heroism and a determined nature that we can all be inspired by. So well done, Riley, and well done to the two clubs that came behind you. I'm very proud of you.
