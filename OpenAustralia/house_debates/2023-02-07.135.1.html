       <p>
        I rise to give thanks to three unsung women of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamborine_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Tamborine Mountain
        </a>
        , in my electorate of Wright. All of these women go about their business very quietly without wanting to seek accolade or fanfare, making our special Tamborine community a better place to live, and it's right that today in this place we acknowledge their contributions. In no particular order I'd like to acknowledge, firstly, Muriel Shephard who has dedicated much of her life to preserving and promoting the rich cultural heritage and history of Tamborine Mountain and its surrounding areas through the Tamborine Mountain Historical Society. Muriel, who has served the society in a number of capacities, is always working to help educate the community about the area's beautiful history, preserving important artefacts and documents and promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation of the mountain's unique character. Muriel, thank you for what you do in preserving our rich local heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Drysdale" rel="nofollow">
         Denise Drysdale
        </a>
        from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manor" rel="nofollow">
         The Manor
        </a>
        . She is the co-owner of a resort and restaurant function centre on the mountain. The Manor offers guest accommodation in unique country Victorian style suites and fine dining, which would be expected of any country manor. Always providing fine service with a smile, Denise works tirelessly to make visitors on the mountain feel at home. She showcases the beauty of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim
        </a>
        and its unique attractions, particularly those in Tamborine Mountain, for the thousands of guests that go through her property each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I acknowledge Ania Sowter of The Polish Place. She and her husband opened The Polish Place some 40 years ago, and it's quickly become one of Tamborine's premier locations for accommodation, dining and the taste of all things Polish. Regrettably, in 2016 The Polish Place tragically burnt to the ground, and in early 2017 I visited Ania and Phil with the ambassador of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Poland" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Poland
        </a>
        and a message from the then Prime Minister of the nation. To stand there and proudly see Ania's resilience in the face of adversity and her determination and persistence to rebuild was awe-inspiring and worthy of note. Such is Ania's determination, along with a healthy dose of community support from the mountain, that in 2020 this iconic Queensland guesthouse reopened to much fanfare, and it has since welcomed many more guests and many more diners to experience this real-life phoenix story rising from the ashes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The stories of Muriel, Denise and Ania all exemplify exactly what the mountain's about: kindness, beauty, a wonderful place to visit, its rich sense of history, its resilience and its enormous community spirit. Come to Tamborine Mountain and see the women who contribute to such a beautiful location in Australia.
