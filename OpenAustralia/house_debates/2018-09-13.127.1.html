        Once again I rise to speak about the shortfalls of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        within my electorate of Werriwa. Today, I would like to raise just two examples of the continuing issues with the delivery of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        and reliable, fast internet to the people of Werriwa. These two examples highlight the continuing struggle to get decent, affordable and reliable NBN connections, regardless of whether you are in the suburbs or a semirural area. Last month, at the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, under questioning from the member for Lyons, it was stated that one of the realities of the internet was that fixed wireless connections would be charged $20 more per month than other NBN connections. When Labor learned of these unfair plans we swiftly called on them to be dropped, and, after two hours, the government performed one of their now trademark backflips.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the areas that receives fixed wireless connection is the semirural suburb of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgerys_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Badgerys Creek
        </a>
        in my electorate. This is the same Badgerys Creek where Western Sydney Airport is currently being constructed. There has been lots of talk among politicians, policy experts and academics about the new airport becoming an aerotropolis. The leading academic in all things aerotropolis, John Kasarda, has stated that the critical factor in any success is connectivity. In the 21st century this means connectivity through roads, connectivity through mass public transport and connectivity through fast, reliable internet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second example affects one of my constituents, Mr Doman, who lives in the residential suburb of Hinchinbrook. This is the same suburb where my electorate office is located. In the middle of 2017, Mr Doman was notified that the NBN would be available in his area. He contacted an internet provider but was told there was an issue and he would not be able to access the network. On nine separate occasions, NBN technicians came to his home but were unable to resolve the problem. My office made inquiries to NBN Co after we were contacted by Mr Doman and we were told that the issue was a network shortfall. That shortfall? The copper cabling is 200 metres short. NBN Co have asked their construction team to work on this issue; however, they anticipate it will not be resolved until March 2019, in another six months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Doman is now the only person left on his street not to have access to the NBN. The fact that he has to wait almost two years to be connected is simply unacceptable. Unfortunately, it's not just the residents of Badgerys Creek or Mr Doman. Too many residents in the electorate of Werriwa and too many Australians have had a poor experience on the NBN. This is an equity issue. Internet is a necessity for students studying, for people who work at home, for connections to the outside world, for enjoyment and for so many other things. A Shorten Labor government will establish an NBN service guaranteed to fix this.
