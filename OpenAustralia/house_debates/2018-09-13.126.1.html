        On Saturday, 1 September I had the privilege of attending the official commemoration service for Private Robert Mactier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        at the Robert Mactier VC Memorial Garden in Tatura. It was a service for the unveiling of a statue to recognise the 100th anniversary of Robert Mactier's being awarded the VC posthumously for outstanding bravery on the battlefield during

        </a>
        . Robert Mactier was born in Tatura in May 1890. He was the seventh of 10 children, went to school locally and later worked on his father's property. He enlisted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Imperial_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Imperial Force
        </a>
        at Seymour on 1 March 1917. During the battle of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_St_Quentin" rel="nofollow">
         Mont St Quentin
        </a>
        on 1 September 1918, Mactier was a battalion runner with the 23rd Battalion. He was sent forward by an officer to determine the cause of a delay in his battalion's moving forward. The cause was a well-placed enemy machine gun. On his own initiative, Mactier jumped out of the trench and charged the gun, killing its crew of six. He then charged two other machine guns, killing their crews and causing at least 40 enemy to surrender. He was later killed by fire from a fourth machine gun, but not before enabling his battalion to form up and saving many of their lives. He was truly a courageous man. I'd like to thank the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        from Tatura's subbranch, Mr Mark Sommers, and also the secretary, Glenda McLeod, and Tatura RSL members for inviting me to that commemoration of the Robert Mactier statue. It will be a very proud addition to Tatura's gardens.

Hopefully, the state government and federal government can get behind this project and deliver a fitting memorial for Sir Murray Bourchier.
