        My question is also to the Minister for Agriculture. Minister, you mentioned the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         National Farmers Federation
        </a>
        . Its vice-president has said of the government's changes to John Howard's environmental protection laws:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … suddenly and with no warning or consultation, we get this put forward …
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, if farming groups were not consulted on these changes, the question becomes: were you consulted? And isn't this just another sign that this government is in absolute chaos?

          I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. I think that it is very important that we clearly understand that local agricultural producers and others with legitimate proprietary, economic, financial and other direct interests will not be affected and can be assured that their voices will be heard and the courts will be available for the protection of their rights. Farming groups can still use their organisation and resources—such as those employed on occasion by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFF" rel="nofollow">
           NFF
          </a>
          , through their fighting fund—to support individuals affected by decisions. Those with a standing interest, those with interests pertinent to issues such as mines, have the capacity to have standing in the courts, as they did in the past. They still have that capacity. It is still the case.
         </p>
         <p>
          But what I am also hearing is that the people of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Central Queensland
          </a>
          want to know how their rights are going in regards to having their jobs supported in the Adani mine. That is an issue that the people of Dawson really want to know about. They want to know whether they have a future, whether they have a job or whether you are still placing skinks and snakes ahead of working men and women in Australia. The member for Capricornia wants to know—

               The member for Herbert certainly wants to know whether the Labor Party are going to put skinks and snakes ahead of the working men and women of Australia. It is a clear question: where do your priorities lie? Do you still stand behind those in high-vis or do you stand behind the 'high-vis' snakes and skinks which we never actually find, we never actually know about, until you go looking for them? The opposition are more interested in supporting their friends in the Greens than supporting the working men and women of

               Now, we have made sure that the farmers still have standing in the court. We have had cabinet discussions to make sure that they still have standing and they can still fight their issues, and that is the information that we have received from the Attorney-General. Those are the discussions of cabinet. But what you have not done—
