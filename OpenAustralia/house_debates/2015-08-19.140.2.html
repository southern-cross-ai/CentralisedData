        Earlier this month, police staff from Liverpool,

        , Fairfield and Cabramatta local area commands took part in the baton relay in recognition of 100 years of women in policing. The baton relay was a national event which has made its way across every police command to commemorate the service of women in policing. Historically, policing has been a male dominated occupation, but, in 1915, the

        police force advertised for its first positions of women in police. It drew more than 500 applications from women seeking to join the police force, but only two were accepted. Lillian Armfield and Maude Rhodes were selected and sworn in as probationary special constables. At the time, they were not allowed to wear a uniform; their main duties were specifically related to issues involving welfare for women and children. It was not until 1965—some 50 years later—that women were given full recognition as police officers and, as such, were entitled to superannuation, long-service leave and other benefits that had been previously denied to them. They were sworn in under the office of constable and were able to exercise full police powers, even though at the time they were largely tasked with duties associated with public relations and school liaison, together with specific investigative work.

        But today the

        is made up of nearly 35 per cent women and, importantly, there is no distinction between the allocation of duties between male and female officers. Women do not just make a great contribution to policing; they are an integral and central element of contemporary law enforcement. While women can be seen taking on more wide-ranging roles in the force, including tactical response units, the rescue squad and the dog units, they are also able to bring specific qualities to the table that help police better relate to the community needs.

        The role of women in policing has come a long way, and this anniversary really puts the light to the fact that, over the last century, changes have occurred in the quality of representation within policing. Women have made, and continue to make, a great contribution to the New South Wales Police Force. On this occasion, on behalf of a very grateful community, may I say thank you to all who have the courage to wear the police uniform.
