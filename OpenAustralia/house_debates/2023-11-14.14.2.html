        Today is

         World Diabetes Day
        </a>
        , and I'm co-chair of the parliamentary 'enemies of diabetes' group with my friend the member for Moreton,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Perrett" rel="nofollow">
         Graham Perrett
        </a>
        , who we'll be hearing from in a moment. In 2023 the campaign focuses on the importance of knowing the risk of type 2 diabetes, to help delay or prevent the condition. There are 1.9 million Australians registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme, with over 300 new people diagnosed every day, and an estimated half a million Australians with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is endemic and epidemic, and diabetes is the seventh-most common cause of death by disease in Australia.

        The electorate of Grey, covering more than 92 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , has the highest diabetes rate in Australia. In fact, state by state, South Australia has the highest incidence of diabetes in the country. I'm not sure why this is so but it needs to be recognised and we need to try to turn that around.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I often say, diabetes is the leading cause of coronary heart disease, blindness and amputation. It is also a major contributor to kidney disease. It's a good thing to avoid if you can, and the good news is: with a healthy diet, good exercise programs and attention to general health, you will generally increase your chances of avoiding diabetes. Diabetes in many cases is a hidden killer, with people officially succumbing to the above aforementioned ailments. But make no mistake: it sets the precondition for life-taking diseases.

         As just stated by the very hardworking member for Grey, today is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Diabetes_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Diabetes Day
         </a>
         ; that's why I'm wearing this badge. I co-chair the Parliamentary Friends for the Prevention of Diabetes group with the member for Grey. He's set out the horror story. As co-chairs, we're very passionate about raising awareness for a condition that affects over 1.5 million Australians.

         Type 1 is very complicated. My mother suffered from type 2 diabetes, diagnosed in her late 50s to early 60s. Coming from country Queensland, a good diet of fresh fruit and veggies wasn't always cheap or readily available—especially for a single parent with 10 children. One of my siblings has just been diagnosed as prediabetic. While my sibling walks to and from work every day, you can't run outrun or outwalk a bad diet. However, as the member for Grey said, there is good news: if you change your diet and lifestyle, you can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Not only is diabetes detrimental at a personal level; it has massive economic costs, with the total annual cost coming in at around $17.6 billion, according to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         . Diabetes Australia provides a number of services including education and support programs, including the Diabetes in Schools program to provide support to Aboriginal and

         students living with type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         On World Diabetes Day, I ask all to think of the impact diabetes has on Australians and to educate—
