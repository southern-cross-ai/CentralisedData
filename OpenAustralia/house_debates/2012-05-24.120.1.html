        I rise today in the House to congratulate and make mention of two great community events and congratulate the organisers of those events. First, I would like to congratulate the organisers and all of the community involved in the

        Biggest Morning Tea, which was held last Thursday in Mount Evelyn at Station House. I was very pleased to attend the Mount Evelyn Biggest Morning Tea. They have been holding this for about five or six years. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and as other members would know from similar local events in their communities, the money raised all goes to the Cancer Council, and in this case Cancer Council Victoria. It was a wonderful community event, and I want to take the time to mention some of the major sponsors, including the Mount Evelyn and District Bendigo Bank, and Jill Rule and her team in particular; Meaghan Grace and the Functional Beverage Company, which provided all of the tea and coffee on the day; Morrisons, led by Jan Simmons, which is a major contributor and fixture in the Mount Evelyn township; Chris Monaghan and the Mount Evelyn Chamber of Commerce, who did so much to bring the event about; Kathie Freeman from the local

        franchise; of course, the

        ; and the Mount Evelyn Primary School and its students, who sang and played music on the morning, capping off what was a wonderful community event.
       </p>

        On Saturday I also had the pleasure of attending the opening of the Monbulk Men's Shed.

        , who is known to Victorian members in this House, was there to open the men's shed. This has been a wonderful community effort led by Brian Tunks and the team at the Open Door Community Church and the Olinda Community House, who helped with the application process. Thanks also go to the Monbulk Primary School, who provided the shed space, and of course the Monbulk Rotary, Monbulk

        and Monbulk Care Network, who joined forces to provide lunch and afternoon tea on what was a very cold and drizzly opening Saturday morning. That will be a great and much-needed facility in the Monbulk community.
