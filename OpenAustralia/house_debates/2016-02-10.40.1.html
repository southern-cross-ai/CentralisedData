        It is a terrific accolade—and it is quite fitting, as the member across the table says, to have a gold award for such a fantastic museum. I commend all of the staff there. I do have to declare a slight conflict of interest as my husband is the

        manager there! Sovereign Hill has managed to pick up this award on three occasions now: in 1993, in 2005 and now for the 2015 year. I really want to encourage people. I come across people from all walks of life who tell me, 'I've been to Sovereign Hill. I was there as a kid as part of the school program.' Come back. The great thing about Sovereign Hill is that it is constantly innovating. With its

        , the light show, the snow—I take my little boy each year—and the little stalls that are there, it is a fantastic innovation in tourism. They are really doing great things in China and have expanded the Chinese market.

        I say to the staff: you are doing a terrific job. It shows what can happen from a very small idea. A small group of people in the 1970s got together and said, 'Let's build a gold museum. Let's build a recreation museum here in Sovereign Hill.' You would think that, at the time, people probably looked at them and thought they were a bit crazy, but what an amazing thing. It employs hundreds of people. Congratulations, Sovereign Hill. Well deserved.
