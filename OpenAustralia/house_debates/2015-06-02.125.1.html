        . For the record, Melbourne, unfortunately for them, fell shy of Port Adelaide by 61 points. But the real winner of course, as always, was the community of Central Australia. Those almost 5,000 people travelled from all parts to attend this football game and enjoy the experience of Traeger Park on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.

        The local football club, the Alice Springs Redtails, forged close links with Port Adelaide, with Port undertaking to assist the Redtails in developing a governance structure and a concise business plan whilst also giving Redtail players an opportunity with a preseason game against the Port Adelaide

        , from the Pit Lands, the Ngaanyatjarra Lands and from as far as Kintore and Nyirripi in the west. The Nyirippi residents were particularly prominent at the ground. For the Nyirippi residents to attend this game they had to travel a 500-kilometre return journey on a dirt road, their community being 440 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs. They were conspicuous by their presence at the southern end of Traeger Park. They are 100 per cent Melbourne Demons supporters and formed a cheer squad decked out in the red and blue colours to rival any other AFL club.

        People of all ages in Central Australia appreciate when a big-city event comes to town, whether it be the footy or a major concert—it is exciting; it creates a buzz. For the youngsters, the opportunity to have a kick, handball or photo opportunity with Melbourne players like Jesse Hogan,

Melbourne's Christian Petracca, along with fellow Demon Jack Trengove, conducted a clinic with 200 school-aged children in the Hermannsburg committee, 130 kilometres west of Alice Springs. He summed it up when he said:
