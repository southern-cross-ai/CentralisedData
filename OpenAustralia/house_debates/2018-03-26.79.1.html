          As you're well aware, Mr Speaker, Darwin was hit by a category 2 cyclone last Saturday. I just want to update the House on how we're going with the clean-up.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was much damage done but, thankfully—touch wood—there have been no injuries and no deaths. But thousands of people went without power—500 households, in fact, are still without power. Can you imagine that, Mr Speaker, in the heat of Darwin? No fans, no air-con and no fridges? The power and water staff are working as hard as they possibly can to restore those services and I want to thank them.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to thank the community. I want to thank the neighbours who checked on neighbours and the strangers who checked on people that, obviously, they didn't even know. The community really pulled together. I want to thank the

          Marines, the 1st Brigade and the emergency services, who've done a splendid job to make our city safe again.
         </p>
         <p>
          We had a difficult time there for several days, and we were very glad that the Leader of the Opposition,

          , came to visit us to see how we were going and to see whether we were getting enough federal support. Now, it is a matter of fact that it took the Prime Minister four days to even pick up the phone. However, I digress: the Prime Minister has an opportunity to redeem himself and to support Darwin with some services that we do require. Some underground power would be a good start.
