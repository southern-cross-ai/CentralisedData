        Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for

         Health and Ageing

        <p>
         I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know he is very concerned about the health of the constituents in his electorate. Our party has a very firm stance on tobacco and a very firm stance on tobacco donations. Tobacco kills you, and we will do all we can to reduce its harm. Our party, the Labor Party, does not take donations from these companies that sell death. Seven years ago the Labor Party ceased taking donations from tobacco companies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Next year plain-packaging reforms will begin, and our tobacco control measures will then be comprehensive—including anti-smoking ads, banning internet ads, an excise increase and nicotine patches on the PBS.

             might be interested to know that yesterday the Cancer Council released the most comprehensive study of the evidence ever published in Australia—24 targeted studies over the last two decades. And what they clearly show is that current packages dilute from the health warnings. It shows that packages has an impact on young people and their perception of cigarettes and those who smoke them.

             … one cigarette, I am told, does you damage. But it does you so little damage.

              David Rowe
             </a>
             did in the
             <i>
              Financial Review
             </i>
             today, in his cartoon, 'Welcome to Abbott country. Enjoy the smooth taste of tobacco donations'! It is about time the Liberal Party stopped receiving donations from tobacco companies. It has been reported that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried about this that he has silenced his MPs from talking about it. That might be why the member for O'Connor, who has come out supporting our measures, explained that he is against the coalition's approach. He supports our measures, explaining: 'As you know, I'm a little bit different from the rest of the Nationals'. Well, he is certainly right about that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is time for Mr Abbott to quit his habit, to stop putting the money and donations before good public policy and to start supporting this measure. Kick the habit, Mr Abbott!
