       <p>
        In light of the Matildas' exciting win last night, the continuing debate around the Voice to Parliament proposal and recent discussions around Closing the Gap, I'd like to talk about a charity based in my electorate that connects a number of these dots called Books n Boots. This not-for-profit has, for the past seven years, been collecting preloved children's books and football boots and sending them to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        rural and remote communities and schools all around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was co-founded by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harding" rel="nofollow">
         John Harding
        </a>
        and Tara Newen. Their vision is to close the health and literacy gap one book at a time. A Meriam Gu-Gu Yulangi man, John was born and bred in Melbourne. He loves his footy and still treasures a decades-old photograph that was published on the front page of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Sun" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
        </i>
        . It features an 11-year-old John Harding, who was a part of Lalor Primary School's football team, which won the 1972 Victorian primary school premiership. The grand final was played at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">
         MCG
        </a>
        , and John, whose efforts that day were recognised with the 'best on ground' award, played in a pair of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Volleys" rel="nofollow">
         Dunlop Volleys
        </a>
        . John was the only Indigenous kid on the team, and he wore a borrowed pair of boots for the photograph. This story explains one part of the inspiration behind Books n Boots. Coming a close second to John's love of football is his passion for literature and creative writing. John has been writing for theatre, television, films and poetry for 35 years and has won several state and national awards, including the Human Rights Drama Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tara, a social worker by training, is a Cham descendant, indigenous to the land now known as Vietnam. Tara has worked for years with First Nations communities, particularly through her involvement with the Margaret Tucker Hostel, which supports at-risk First Nations teenage girls.
       </p>
       <p>
        The spark that lit the flame of Books n Boots was a social media post from a teacher on Darnley Island in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait
        </a>
        , home to John's mother. The teacher had posted a desperate call for books because all the children on the island were stuck reading the same books over and over again, and so Books n Boots was born. For John and Tara, healthy minds and healthy bodies are indivisible. Both are critical to wellbeing programs. We know that a love of reading plays a key role in developing literacy and education more generally, and appropriate learning material—and plenty of it—is a key part of Closing the Gap. The evidence also suggests that there is no difference in year 12 completion rates and university participation, for example, if Indigenous and non-Indigenous students are at the same level of academic achievement at age 15. This is why early intervention is so critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since it was founded in 2015, Books n Boots has donated 16 tonnes of books, which equates to some 50,000 books diverted from landfill and delivered to First Nations communities. Last year, the Tiny Treasures program delivered its first shipment of 400 books to a youth justice centre and delivered books to four states and territories. Council libraries in Maribyrnong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonee_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Moonee Valley
        </a>
        provide the majority of the books, while local schools and households can drop off boots with community radio station 3CR, which offers a drop-off point. A dedicated band of volunteers comb each book by hand, cleaning them and ensuring that the content is culturally appropriate. If there is any doubt, a board member is consulted. Only books in excellent condition are sent to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand is enormous for their services. Some 15 sporting clubs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        are on the waiting list for boots and sport shoes from Books n Boots. A primary school in that town is also on the waiting list, with most of the 135 children attending the school barefoot. Following a program on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_National" rel="nofollow">
         Radio National
        </a>
        about the charity that aired in 2020, Tara and John were inundated with offers of help from all over the nation. All of these are currently on hold because Books n Boots desperately needs more financial support so that it can expand. Currently operating out of John and Tara's home, Books n Boots desperately needs a place to call home. There is no shortage of book donations, but there is a shortage of places to store them. Their goal is a network of hubs across Victoria and interstate, which would also help their environmental goals by cutting down on transport costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I offer my congratulations to John and Tara. Here's to many more offers of help and philanthropic donations to their very worthwhile organisation.
