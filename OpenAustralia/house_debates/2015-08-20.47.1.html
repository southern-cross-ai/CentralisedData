       <p>
        I rise today to commend the good work that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        branch of the Council of the Ageing, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COTA" rel="nofollow">
         COTA
        </a>
        , has done. I have enjoyed working with COTA over the last few years and have seen firsthand the tireless effort that they have put into advocating on behalf of senior Territorians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just yesterday they ran a seniors expo in Darwin and, by all accounts, it was very successful. The event attracted stallholders from across the spectrum of the community. There were advocacy groups and care providers, and there was also an excellent program of speakers and entertainers. For the hundreds of seniors who attended, it was a fantastic opportunity to access and find out about the broad range of services available to them. Also, I am told that it was a great social occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previously COTA had also run
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        information sessions to help the older residents of Darwin and Palmerston get connected. I would like to acknowledge the work they have done in running seniors rights workshops as well. To Graeme Bevis, Dean Dempsey, Stephanie Kendall and all the crew down at Spillett House, I want to say: Territorians owe you gratitude and thanks. Thank you for the excellent work that you do on behalf senior Territorians. I am just sorry that I was not able to be at your expo yesterday, but my very excellent staff were there. You put on a good outcome. Thank you very much.
