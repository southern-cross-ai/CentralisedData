       <p>
        March 8 is a significant date in the calendar of women. It is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        . It's a reminder to be part of the growing awareness of women around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        For me, today, this date has more relevance than ever. Following all the stories about women refugees in Jordan, Syria, Pakistan and Bangladesh, in particular, I can only say thank you to our Australian government for all their initiatives in making the lives of women better, both internationally and domestically. I am proud that we, as a nation, are the founder of and largest donor to the United Nations Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund. During my travels I have been constantly reminded by conference statements, bronze statues and development aims that 'Women are People'. The life-size statues in Ottawa were challenging, to say the least.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a consequence, in honour of my granddaughters, Sophie Mae and Eve Nellie, who are here today, and every granddaughter around the world, I say: be strong in being a woman. Don't ever let your compassion for others and your caring and sharing, that your parents Romee and Barry are instilling in your characters, be seen as a weakness! It is not; it's a reflection of your integrity and your love of others: it's a hidden strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        May everyone's granddaughter grow in the knowledge of who they are! I hope each one can say, 'I am woman, I am good and I am proud!'
