       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge and thank Noel Bultitude from my community on his 75 years of service to the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>
        Woolgoolga Brigade. Noel joined the brigade at 14 as a volunteer firefighter, along with his dad, when the first meeting was held in the local fruit-packing shed. Over the last 75 years, Noel has worked his way up and is in a senior role as a deputy group captain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early in his career, Noel was instrumental in securing a building for the station, which the brigade quickly outgrew. Noel then, in typical fashion, led the fundraising every Saturday for a new station, which is still in use today. Known as a trusted and respected crew leader, Noel has travelled to Canberra and Sydney as part of campaigns for the RFS. In his 75th year of service and at the age of 90, Noel is still on call, spends his time doing maintenance and repairs and mentoring other members, and still regularly responds to incidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Noel's most memorable achievements including being awarded the national medal with four clasps, the 70th-year RFS long-service medal with five clasps—and, obviously, he's now getting the 75th—and, more recently, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Noel's wife, Betty, along with children Julie and Karen and family celebrated his recent achievements. Noel, thank you on behalf of our community.
