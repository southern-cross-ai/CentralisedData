        I rise today to talk about the hardworking Mayor of the Shire of Carpentaria, in the

         Gulf Country
        </a>
        of

        </a>
        , Councillor Les Wilson, who sadly lost his nine-month battle with cancer earlier this month. Councillor Wilson was born on 9 November 1953 in Aramac to Jim and Phillis Wilson. He stayed in Aramac until he was 15, when he left school and went up to Karumba in the hope of catching barramundi. Barramundi was not the only thing that hooked him in Karumba. He built his life around the people in that community, whom he would later go on to serve with great distinction in local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over a period of 23 years, Councillor Wilson served in public office and as the Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentaria_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Carpentaria Shire Council
        </a>
        for seven years, and as the deputy mayor for another seven years. Councillor Wilson held the position of mayor until his death earlier this month. Councillor Wilson will be remembered for his time on the Carpentaria Shire Council as being a strong advocate for the gulf region—one of those self-reliant, grumpy people who stand up for their community in all circumstances, as an advocate, a builder and a defender of their community. They are wonderful people and Councillor Wilson was one of them and their leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        He worked closely with neighbouring shires and lobbied tirelessly for better services and infrastructure. That is how I met him, on a visit to Normanton, where Les showed his true nature both as a wonderful host and as a tough advocate for his shire and community. One of the things all successful sustainable regional communities have in common is that sense of self-motivation. Sustainable communities are made up of people with a can-do attitude and a visible, proactive response to change and challenges. Councillor Wilson demonstrated that he was always prepared to stand up and be counted. He was genuinely interested in sustainable solutions to providing employment and to keeping his community growing and vibrant.
       </p>
       <p>
        He played a significant role in the success of the local regional development agenda. He was always striving to develop innovative ways to reduce ratepayer costs and deliver superior services. He cared deeply about his community and often volunteered behind the scenes at community events and organisations. At the event I attended he was the host, the barman and in charge of the barbecue. He cared so deeply about his community. He volunteered for his rural fire brigade service, his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        and his volunteer marine rescue—he was a person who walked the walk and talked the talk. Councillor Wilson cared deeply for his family and is survived by his partner, Donna; his sons, Ian and Brian; and his grandchildren, Tara, Ella and James.
