        As you enter the electorate of Bennelong you quickly notice a firm line of separation between the commercial hub of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Park
        </a>
        , which includes some of our country's biggest corporate names, and the quiet, leafy suburbia of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         North Ryde
        </a>
        . The line is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Epping Road
        </a>
        , dividing the bustling university and shopping centre from schools, family homes, small village shops and children's playgrounds. Many families have established themselves in North Ryde over recent years, crafting their own interpretation of the great Australian dream.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the forefront is Tennis World. More than half of my life I have been visiting Tennis World, running coaching clinics for school students or just enjoying a casual game with friends. Whilst community health and recreation facilities have been demolished across the region, Tennis World has remained as a venue for school groups and local residents. Unfortunately, the shadow of development now looms large over this area and the local community battles the threat of high-rise construction crossing onto the southern side of Epping Road and consuming the Tennis World site. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government has put forward a development proposal for one of the state's largest residential developments in order to activate the North Ryde railway station precinct. The vast majority of this development sits on vacant land on the northern side of Epping Road.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hold great concern about the crossing of that development over Epping Road and the proposed demolition of community recreation space. I have repeatedly made it clear to the local community that I do not support any development on the Tennis World site. Several months ago I had a private meeting with Premier Barry O'Farrell's chief of staff and policy director on the topic of traffic congestion and transport infrastructure. At the end of this meeting I took the opportunity to make clear my opposition to this part of the development. Perhaps after 16 years of state Labor government, I have become conditioned to think that such decisions are made in back rooms. Instead, I was immediately informed that there is no opportunity for anyone to influence any state infrastructure development outside of the established planning and consultation processes. As we watch the drama unfold at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
         ICAC
        </a>
        , this is a new way of doing business under the New South Wales coalition and it is to be commended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several days ago, the Department of Planning and Infrastructure announced that a 45-day consultation period for the North Ryde precinct development has commenced. I will be informing all local residents that I will provide them with every level of assistance to put forward the strongest possible objection to development on the southern side of Epping Road. This unique barrier between the high-rise fast pace of Macquarie Park and low-rise family environment of North Ryde must be maintained.
