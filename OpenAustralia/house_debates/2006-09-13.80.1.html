        </a>
        I present the 14th and 15th reports for 2006 of the committee relating to—Facilities upgrade to the

         Shoalwater Bay

       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the reports be made Parliamentary Papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The 14th report of 2006 addresses the proposed facilities upgrade to the Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Rockhampton, Queensland, at an estimated cost of $11.16 million. The Shoalwater Bay Training Area is an area of approximately 454,000 hectares located 80 kilometres north of Rockhampton, Queensland. The Shoalwater Bay Training Area provides a highly effective training location for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        ’s three services and a focal point for major national and multilateral combined arms exercises. These exercises commonly involve defence forces of the United States,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the Republic of Singapore.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facility enhancements to the Shoalwater Bay Training Area involve the construction of an exercise control building and an urban operations training facility to support the upcoming exercise Talisman Sabre 2007. The committee visited the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in July this year, conducted a site inspection of the area and held a public hearing which was well attended by the local community. The committee investigated all aspects of the works, paying particular attention to the nature of activities within the area, environment and heritage concerns, and consultation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee noted that submissions to the inquiry and evidence provided at the hearing raised concerns with the consultation process. Defence assured the committee that it, through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA" rel="nofollow">
         HLA
        </a>
        Envirosciences, had undertaken all consultation as listed in its statement of evidence, including community meetings, escorted tours of the training area and specific Indigenous community consultation. In this regard the committee recommends that Defence continue its close ongoing consultation with all relevant groups and organisations with regard to the facilities upgrade of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. Environment and heritage concerns for the inquiry included the use of depleted uranium and sites of heritage significance within the training area. Defence assured the committee that there is no depleted uranium used within the Shoalwater Bay Training Area by Australian or international forces. An environmental advisory committee has been established by Defence to ensure it is open and transparent about the environmental effects of its activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence stated that the proposed facilities upgrade would not impact on any historical or heritage sites within the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. A number of heritage studies had been undertaken, including a specific study to identify and address Indigenous cultural heritage considerations. Subsequent to the hearing, the committee was provided with a copy of this report. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the proposed facilities upgrade to the Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Rockhampton, Queensland, proceed at the estimated cost of $11.16 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee’s 15th report of 2006 presents findings in relation to the proposed facilities for troop lift helicopters,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Townsville" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Townsville
        </a>
        , Queensland, at an estimated cost of $20 million. The purpose of the proposed works is to provide facilities to support the introduction of the multirole helicopter 90 aircraft or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
         MRH
        </a>
        90, as it is commonly known. This will include the refurbishment, re-use and construction of facilities at the 5th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Aviation Regiment
        </a>
        facilities. The 5th Aviation Regiment is located in the south-western precinct of the RAAF Base Townsville, which is approximately seven kilometres from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville CBD
        </a>
        . The base is maintained for the defence and surveillance of the north-eastern areas of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        A concern raised at the hearing was the sharing of the runway between RAAF Base Townsville and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville Airport
        </a>
        . Defence were able to clarify for the committee that the runway belongs to the Commonwealth, and there is a joint user deed between Defence and Townsville Airport. At the committee’s request, a copy of the joint user deed was supplied to the committee subsequent to the hearing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The MRH90 aircraft is being introduced under the Defence Capability Plan Project Air 9000. Defence stated at the hearing that in June this year the Prime Minister announced the purchase of an additional 34 multirole helicopters as part of Project Air 9000. In this regard, the committee inquired as to the impact of this operational change and how it may affect Defence forward planning. Defence responded that it was confident the proposed works can accommodate the multirole helicopters and that RAAF Base Townsville is consistent with Defence future long-term planning.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the public hearing the committee sought assurances from Defence that ecologically sustainable development initiatives had been incorporated into the facility design. Defence confirmed that the cost-effective
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESD" rel="nofollow">
         ESD
        </a>
        was a key objective in the design, development and delivery of new and refurbished facilities. The list of features included insulation and weatherproofing seals, energy efficient lighting and lighting control systems, energy efficient plant and equipment, and specifications of waterless urinals and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA
        </a>
        water efficient fixtures.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the hearing the committee expressed its appreciation to Defence for the very comprehensive site inspection and the quality of the evidence provided to the inquiry, which greatly aided the committee in its consideration of the proposed works. Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the committee recommends that the proposed provision of facilities for troop lift helicopters, RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, proceed at an estimated cost of $20 million. Once again, I thank my committee colleagues, Hansard, the secretariat and all those who assisted with the inspections and the public hearings. I commend the reports to the House.

        <p>
         by leave—I lend my support to the comments made by the member for Pearce with respect to the two projects to be undertaken in Townsville and Rockhampton. I agree with the comments that were outlined. I would like to say, as a member who was in attendance on both occasions, that we properly examined the matters that were before us. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         provided sufficient information and followed up when we asked for further information. The hearing at Townsville also had the local federal member, the member for Herbert, in attendance and we provided an opportunity for him to make comment. That hearing went off without any particular problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was not able to be involved in the inspection of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Shoalwater Bay
         </a>
         site. However, I have been to Shoalwater Bay before and I was able to see the site prior to the inspection provided to the Joint Standing Committee on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
          Public Works
         </a>
         on the day. We had quite a busy time at the public hearing. There were a number of community organisations in attendance. The federal member for Capricornia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Livermore" rel="nofollow">
          Kirsten Livermore
         </a>
         , was also in attendance. She raised some questions, ensuring that she was protecting the community’s interests. The local mayor was also in attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to point out one thing which was raised informally on the day and which is something we might have to consider in relation to those types of hearings. Whilst the hearing on the day went well, and those who might have had some objections to the particular proposal were given the right to express those objections and they had access to the location, it might have been more fitting if the Rockhampton hearing had been held off-base. There were no particular concerns raised with me directly, but it might be more suitable, if there is a Defence project and there are citizens or organisations wanting to involve themselves in the public works process, to have that hearing located on neutral ground, as it were. Perhaps something like a municipal office or another location would be more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also, along with the chair of the committee, thank Hansard, the secretariat of the committee and members who managed to find their way—you know how it is, Mr Deputy Speaker—to these regional places to do the work that is required of them.
