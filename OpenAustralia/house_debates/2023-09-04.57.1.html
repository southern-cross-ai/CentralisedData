        We all have memories, and some memories are core memories because you never forget them. A core memory for me was when my school saw a fire burn down classrooms in year 7 and year 11. Last Saturday, 26 August, when I saw smoke rise from the Heatherwood School in Donvale, my heart broke for the community. It was a devastating fire that destroyed six classrooms. The local emergency service providers responded promptly and with courage, and I thank them. I also thank the parents, teachers and local businesses who have rallied around the school. A person has been arrested, and that is a matter for the justice system. But what happens from here is for the students, the parents and the community to rally around the school and help them rebuild.

        This is a school that has seen a builder go into liquidation, and they're already 20 classroom short, with students sitting in the library and in a garage. They're sharing portaloos with the builders. That isn't good enough, so we need to help them right now. The school is understaffed, and the staff are doing the best they can. I spoke with the principal,

        , earlier today, and he told me that this school is unlike any others. Families travel from Warburton and Hillsborough, in the electorate of the member for Casey, because it is a unique school. One of the values of the school is resilience and persistence. I remember when I was a student that we all rallied around our teacher and our parents and everyone to rebuild. I know you will do that, and we will be here for you.
