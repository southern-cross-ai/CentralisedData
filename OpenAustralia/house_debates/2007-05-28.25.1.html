       <p>
        The electorate of Gorton does not have a Medicare office. The population explosion in the west of Melbourne has not been matched with an increase in appropriate Commonwealth public services. Medicare is a basic health service and yet there is not one Medicare office in the entire electorate. With the single notable exception of the funding of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Deer Park
        </a>
        bypass after a concerted community campaign, the federal government has neglected the needs of Melbourne’s expanding western corridor. Areas of my electorate, in particular suburbs like Deer Park and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans" rel="nofollow">
         St Albans
        </a>
        , have a disproportionate number of elderly residents. These elderly residents remember a time, not that long ago, when they did have access to a Medicare office in their own community at Deer Park. However, that office has been closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ideal location for such an office would be the rapidly expanding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergardens_Town_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Watergardens Town Centre
        </a>
        , which is quickly becoming the major shopping and transport hub for the outer western suburbs. It is also the centre for one of the fastest-growing corridors anywhere in Australia. Until the government announces plans for a Medicare office in my electorate, voters in the electorate will rightly see the absence of such a basic health facility in their community as a sign of the lack of regard the federal government has for their needs. I hereby table a petition of 3,831 petitioners demanding the government locate such an office in the electorate of Gorton.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the failure of the federal Government to establish a Medicare office in the federal electorate of Gordon.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recognising the rapid expansion in population in the western Melbourne corridor and the associated need for federal government services, your petitioners call on the House to support the establishment of a Medicare office in the federal electorate of Gordon.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 3,831 citizens.
