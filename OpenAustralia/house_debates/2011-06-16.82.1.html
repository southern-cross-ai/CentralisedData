        I rise to pass on my condolences and I am sure those of this House in relation to Desmond Patrick Webb, a person in the Petrie electorate known not only for his tremendous effort with the Redcliffe Leagues Club and the Redcliffe district rugby league club but also for his community spirit in everything he did in the Redcliffe peninsula. Dessy passed away on 7 June 2011 at the age of 73. His service was held on Tuesday, 14 June. Many people turned up for that service. Unfortunately, obviously I could not be in attendance because I was here in parliament. I want to convey one of the messages delivered at Dessy's service, one that really reflects who Dessy was. It was delivered by Rupert McCall, the well-known master of ceremonies, guest speaker, media presenter and extremely talented poet, and Redcliffe boy. Rupert did what Rupert does best and he wrote a poem about Dessy. This is Rupert McCall's poem,

        I thank Rupert for agreeing to let me read that today. Dessy Webb started playing with the Dolphins in 1976. He was a team manager and an administrator. He joined the board in 1968 and took over as president in 1988, until his passing last week. But he was so much more than just the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcliffe_Dolphins" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Redcliffe Leagues Club—though he was the Redcliffe Leagues Club and the Redcliffe Dolphins. This is a man whom I got to know had a huge heart and a huge community spirit. He spent much time with the club helping young kids and did everything to ensure that they could play the sport, that it was affordable and accessible and that they had great mentors. He also took that message recently out to those schools to teach high school students how to be responsible and consider their actions, and how to follow the right path for their future. He was an amazing man, one that will be sadly missed but of course definitely not forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of his sons, Terry, spoke at the service on Tuesday and said how Dessy got into football. He said that he had spotted a young lady that he was attracted to and was courting her, and approached her father, who said, 'If you want to date my daughter, you will play for the Dolphins,' and that is what he did. He continued with the club until his passing last week. On behalf of me and my family, all of those people who got to know Dessy on the Redcliffe peninsula and those associated with the Redcliffe Leagues Club and the Dolphins, we pass on our condolences to his wife, Aileen, and his sons and their families at this very difficult time. Our thoughts and our wishes are with them and they are in our hearts.
