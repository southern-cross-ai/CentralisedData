       <p>
        I rise to recognise the lifelong work of a much loved member of our community, Laura Tolliday, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        who lives in my electorate of Pearce and who has contributed a significant amount of her life to sport. That dedication and commitment were recognised this month when Laura was proudly inducted into the WA Women's Hall of Fame, which acknowledges the achievements and contributions that women have made to WA society, community, history and culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Laura Tolliday is 95 years of ageâ€”a beautiful, good-hearted, community-minded woman who we are all so incredibly proud of. Laura is a woman of many firsts in life in sport. She joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWCA" rel="nofollow">
         YWCA
        </a>
        in 1949 to play netball and became a state champion. She also played in the first WA women's cricket team to compete in the All Australian Women's Cricket Carnival. Laura continues to be involved in netball and has helped start youth clubs, supporting youth and recognising the importance of sport in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an inductee, Laura joins more than 200 women who are creating a wonderful legacy. Their recognition in the WA Women's Hall of Fame is a powerful celebration of women in our community. Laura is also a member of our wonderful Knit and Natter group. She knits jumpers with magic stripes, and those are donated to charities, which includes the

        </a>
        . They are incredibly important jumpers for those children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, Laura Tolliday. We salute you.
