        I rise to update the House on the drought, to affirm the nation's support for our courageous farmers and farming communities and to outline measures we are taking to help. All of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and two-thirds of Queensland are officially in drought, with many other areas suffering too. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        , it's the worst drought in New South Wales since the mid-1960s and may turn out to be worse. Unlike a fire or a flood, which inflict immediate physical damage to people, property, homes and infrastructure, a drought is insidious, longer and more widespread. Farmers find themselves going to enormous expense just to keep their livestock alive in the hope of rain, physically working harder than ever and losing money all the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of drought preparation and management is timely destocking but that raises the awful question of whether you'll be able to afford to restock when the drought breaks. The New South Wales farmer who destocked six months ago will feel confident he made the right call. His neighbour may wish he had done the same, but if it had rained five months ago their perceptions would be reversed. The croppers are facing hard times as well. Many winter crops sewn will fail and others won't be sewn at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our climate is tough but so are our farmers. They are resourceful, resilient and innovative, quick to develop and adopt new technologies. Agriculture contributes three per cent to our economy, a gross value of $60 billion in 2017-18. Australian farmers export about 77 per cent of what they produce. Farm exports, aided by our big free trade agreements, earnt $44.8 billion in 2016-17, up from $32.5 billion in 2010-11.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Farmers' Federation's vision for a $100 billion a year farm gate industry is undaunted by the drought. In 2016-17 304,000 people were directly employed in agriculture, with the complete supply chain, including food and fibre industries, providing over 1.6 million jobs. Governments need to respond swiftly and effectively. There is no set and forget here. Just as the drought evolves, so must our policy responses. We have to be as practical and clear-eyed as the farmers we're supporting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I announced a $190 million drought package, bringing our government's drought policy commitment to more than $576 million. The farm household allowance, typically around $16,000, is being supplemented this year by two one-off payments amounting to $12,000 per couple. We've also extended the availability of the farm household allowance for another year and eased the asset test. Thousands more farmers will be eligible. I urge farmers to ensure they're getting all the help that's available by seeking advice from the rural financial counsellors we've engaged. We have also provided $11.4 million for mental health support initiatives and $15 million for not-for-profit community groups in drought-affected areas. This is in addition to the more than $852 million in concessional loans for drought and other assistance approved to 1,559 farm businesses since 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Regional Investment Corporation, established on 1 July, has $2 billion available for concessional loans to farm businesses and over $2 billion for concessional loans for water infrastructure that will enhance water security and support regional economies. In 2016, to support resilience, we doubled the amount farmers could put into farm management deposits to $800,000, changing the law to allow them to be used as offsets against a farmer's mortgage. A record $6.6 billion was held in 55,000 accounts at 30 June this year so that many farmers putting money aside, free of tax, in good years can bring to account in tough years like this one. We are also working on further long-term measures to improve the resilience of our rural communities and will be announcing the next phase of our drought support in coming weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like finally to commend everyone who has rallied behind our farmers and the communities who support them. I want to thank families, businesses and charities but also the kids. Young Maisie in

Now, in these hard, dry times, more than ever, we have your back.

         I thank the Prime Minister for his words. Last week, my wife Chloe and I, along with the member for Hunter, had the privilege of visiting Longreach, Ilfracombe, Barcaldine and Emerald in Western Queensland. We had the privilege of listening to locals, who are battling this devastating drought. They generously welcomed us and educated us.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Brown" rel="nofollow">
          Jody Brown
         </a>
         , who runs sheep and cattle on Latrobe Station, out of Longreach, told me a lot of farmers feel like the drought cycles are getting longer and longer and the periods of relief and rain are getting shorter and shorter. Her words remind us that climate change is not some graph on a page in a report; it has devastating consequences for families and their livelihoods.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Aaron Skinn, a very hardworking baker who runs a family bakery in Barcaldine, told me: 'Drought is hitting not just farms but the local towns as well.' This is why we need a coordinated national approach to deal with this one-in-100-year event. This means mobilising the resources of the Commonwealth to ensure that farmers can get their fodder, grain or water, while also maintaining biosecurity so that we're not transporting fire ants along with it. We need to make sure also that the jobs in the local cafe, the produce store and the metal fabricators are secure. If we keep the farms going, we keep the towns going.
        </p>
        <p>
         The people who call this part of Australia home are brave and proud. But farming life can be precarious, as we currently witness. I think it takes a lot for them to ask for help from Canberra. So when they do, we should recognise that the need is dire. That is why Labor has said that the $12,000 in government assistance for families shouldn't be divided and staggered over one payment in September this year and one next March. If you need the lot up-front, you should just get it up-front. There should be no piles of paperwork and no bureaucratic delays. I think there's more we can do as a parliament to build water infrastructure in communities and on farms, and to work with the agronomists resowing the pasture. Let me also say to the big banks: you relied on government guarantee to get you through the global financial crisis; we will hold you to account for the way you treat communities in need.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has recently reached $700 million in penalties from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Bank
         </a>
         . Prime Minister, together we should think about putting some of that money into drought relief rather than giving it back to banks as a tax break. Prime Minister, together let's work on a plan to reinvest these penalties in some of the people who've suffered more than their fair share of rip-offs from the banks. And, like the Prime Minister, I briefly want to thank everyone in our cities who's digging deep to support the various appeals and fundraisers. There are lots of people organising some fantastic initiatives, from something as simple as 'Parma for a farmer' to the big drought relief concert set to be headlined by the great Australian Johnny Farnham next Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barcaldine of course is where the Labor Party was born. But when I was there I also spoke with plenty of lifelong National Party people about what this parliament can do. At times like this, political identity is so far down the list that it doesn't matter. There are not
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
          LNP
         </a>
         Australians going through the drought or Labor Australians going through the drought; there are just Australians. I think I speak for all members in this place when I say to farmers in dire need: you are our fellow Australians, and we are on your side.
