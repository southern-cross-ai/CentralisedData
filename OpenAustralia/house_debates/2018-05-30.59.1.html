        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister have confidence that each statement Minister Cash has made to the parliament in relation to the circumstances surrounding the

         I have complete confidence in the minister, Senator Cash. I will just return to the central fact. You've raised the issue that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
          AWU
         </a>
         has issued a subpoena to Senator Cash.
        </p>
        <p>
         Opposition members: The court!
        </p>
        <p>
         Sorry, the court has, at the request of the AWU, of course, thank you. On the application of the union, the court issued the subpoena. This is the third subpoena. One was substantially set aside; the other was completely set aside. Senator Cash is entitled to seek to set aside a subpoena if it's judged not relevant. That is a legal matter for the court. Again, the rule of law must prevail. The central issue, the reason there are court proceedings at all, is that the Registered Organisations Commission is seeking to determine whether the Leader of the Opposition paid $100,000 of his members' money to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
          GetUp
         </a>
         ! without authority. I think all honourable members would agree that, if the Leader of the Opposition paid $100,000 of his members' money to GetUp! without authority, that would be a very serious wrong, a very serious act of misconduct, misappropriating other people's money. The union has taken action to stop the Registered Organisations Commission from investigating this, and the question is why. It would be very easy to prove. There are plenty of lawyers on that side; all they would need is the minutes of the meeting duly attested and proved, and that would demonstrate that the payment was made with authority. Why hasn't it been produced? No wonder people increasingly believe they cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition with other people's money, let alone with the management of our economy.
