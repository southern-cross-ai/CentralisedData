        Before I begin I would like to commend the member for Durack for her attempt at Hindi. I actually learned Hindi before I was posted to India. It is a challenging but wonderful language and you did a great job, so congratulations.

        Last month I had the pleasure of touring the Lions Youth Haven, which is a 70-bed hostel in Kambah. Members will know about the great work Lions clubs do all around Australia, and I am pleased to tell you about an initiative in my electorate. The Lions Youth Haven has helped more than 500 students over the past four years, through practical, hands-on time on a farm.

        Westwood Farm in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuggeranong_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Tuggeranong Valley
        </a>
        provides a haven for youth at risk in our community. It is a place where young people in situations of crisis can find refuge and support, where they can gain confidence and self-respect and where they can receive vocational training and hands-on experience in horticulture and agriculture. It is about giving youth the skills to work on the land, to understand sustainable agriculture and animal handling.

        I applaud the organisation on its 'paddock to the plate' program, where students learn how the meat and veggies on their plate are produced. I am also pleased a new lodge has opened at the farm providing overnight accommodation for school, sporting and other community groups like the students who come to Canberra for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEO" rel="nofollow">

        program. The lodge aims to provide a taste of rural life for students visiting Canberra, but it also plays a much bigger role.

        I take this opportunity to congratulate the
