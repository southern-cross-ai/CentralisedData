        I would like to continue celebrating great Australians from Bennelong who have received awards as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        is Mr Phillip Wai-Shing Ng, who has been awarded for his services to Chinese language education and to the community. In 1982 Mr Ng founded the Dundas Chinese School, and he has remained its principal ever since. He has educated hundreds, if not thousands, of pupils over the years. In addition, he has served on the

         New South Wales
        </a>
        Chinese Language Education Council as an executive board member and has helped organise the National Chinese Eisteddfod since 1989. His contributions to the large Chinese community in Bennelong and New South Wales have been invaluable.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge Mr Robert Selinger, who has been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community and to education. Mr Selinger has an extensive history with the

        of Chatswood, having served most recently as the treasurer between 2015-19 but also previously on three occasions as its president. In his professional career Mr Selinger has a long career as a teacher, serving as the principal of

        The people I have spoken about today are just a couple of the wonderful members of our community who have done so much.
