        His Excellency Dr Yudhoyono will address this parliament on Wednesday, 10 March at 2 pm. The House will meet as usual at 9 am to consider the introduction of bills and government business. The parliament will then suspend at 12 noon for the official luncheon in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        . The President will address the House of Representatives at 2 pm with both members and senators present. The parliament will again suspend following the address of His Excellency and resume at approximately 4 pm with the tabling of documents, statements and the resumption of debate. There will be no question time. Parliament will adjourn as usual at 7.30 pm.

        The visit by the recently re-elected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_President" rel="nofollow">
         Indonesian President
        </a>
        , and his address to the House, are deeply significant. Such an invitation is reserved for a very small number and it reflects the strength and importance of the Australia-Indonesia relationship. Indonesia is emerging not just as a regional strength but as a global influence, as its G20 membership reflects. Its strategic, social and economic importance to Australia in this century cannot be overestimated. We look forward very much to the address to the House by President Yudhoyono. I commend the changed arrangements to the House.
