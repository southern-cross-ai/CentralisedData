        A couple of months ago calls and emails began to flood into my office expressing concern and even anger at the proposed permanent closure of a number of median crossings along the very busy St Georges Road. Living just off St Georges Road myself, these were concerns I well understood. This proposal comes after Darebin City Council passed a motion and wrote to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VicRoads" rel="nofollow">
         VicRoads
        </a>
        last year seeking permanent closure of those crossings. In response to community concerns the Victorian member for Northcote,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Richardson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and I wrote to affected locals, seeking their views on this important local issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The response was overwhelming, as you can see. Literally hundreds and hundreds of responses flooded into my office. Over 80 per cent of people wanted to see those crossings reopen, with more than 75 per cent giving traffic congestion as their key concern. Many also expressed concern about the negative impact being experienced by local businesses and on pedestrian safety. Eighty per cent said they had not been adequately consulted by Darebin council and that they were greatly disappointed in their council.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank everyone who shared their views and I commit to representing those views on this issue as it moves forward. I should note that cyclist safety is a personal concern for meâ€”my wife, Liberty, rides to work every day and my family often cycle around the neighbourhood. This concern was reflected in the survey, with a majority of people supporting measures to improve cyclist safety, but it is time for Darebin council to end its war on cars.
