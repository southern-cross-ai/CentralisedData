        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. What steps is the Albanese Labor government taking to combat veterans' homelessness?

         I thank the member for Tangney for this important question and for the work he's doing with veterans in his community. I know that he has visited with organisations in his electorate that are looking to provide homelessness services to support veterans in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , which is really important. We learned how important it is in March, when the census data was released that showed that, on census night in 2021, 1,555 individuals who have served our nation were homeless. In the first 12 months of this Albanese Labor government, we've been working to deliver on our commitments to build a stronger foundation for a better future for veterans and families. That includes things like, in the October budget that we handed down, $3.6 million for the Scott Palmer Services Centre in Darwin, which will provide homelessness services for veterans in Darwin and which is very important.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I want to draw members' attention to the report by Housing All Australians that was handed down in May this year,
         <i>
          Give me shelter:
         </i>
         <i>
          l
         </i>
         <i>
          eav
         </i>
         <i>
          e no veteran behind
         </i>
         . They said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is in a housing crisis. We don't have enough social, affordable and public housing for the people who need it most, including our veterans and other key workers. This has long-term implications for Australian society as we know it today.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Doing nothing is just not an option.
        </p>
        <p>
         That report made a key recommendation:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Alongside the investment required by governments to address the lack of public, social, and affordable housing supply, investment in outreach services and the development of more targeted and intensive care programs that provide comprehensive and ongoing support could be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm very proud to be part of a government that wants to do exactly that. Part of our commitment at the last election, as part of the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund—the legislation for which we are trying to get through the parliament right now—was that $30 million would be allocated to build housing and fund specialist support services for veterans experiencing homelessness. After a wasted decade, we are now running out of time.

         </a>
         Australia says, 'The time for action is now.' Vasey RSL Care says, 'We urge the parliament to come together and reach agreement.' I met with the RAAFA in WA only yesterday about this important issue. They would like to be able to fund services in a state which currently has no specialist veteran homelessness service, yet we can't do that. It's not because we don't want to. We can't do it because the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens party are saying no. They are saying no to funding veterans homelessness services—

          They can shout about it all they like, but the reality is that it is those parties that are holding up providing these services that are desperately needed right now.
