       <p>
        Last Saturday I attended the 70th anniversary of the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade, a steadfast pillar of support for our local community. Down in my part of the world we live in the best part of the best country in the world, but the land of droughts and flooding rains takes its toll. That's why the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade is such an important part of our local community. Its support extends not only to the residents of Loftus and the Sutherland shire but throughout the whole of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Particularly locally, the brigade has responded to incidents at the Caltex oil refinery as well as many motor vehicle accidents and also provides crews for hazard reduction. This is a vital activity for our community, as we adjoin the Royal and Heathcote national parks. The brigade also plays a vital role in education, with bushfire preparedness, and year after year the brigade receives tremendous support from its local Santa runs. The strength of the Loftus brigade also lies in its diversities, with operational members ranging from the ages of 19 through to 92. Volunteer members of the brigade come from a wide range of vocational and professional backgrounds as well as defence and emergency services. It currently has 14 new probationary members, which sets it up for a very fine future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, on behalf of my electorate I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade. To all of you who have been or are part of the brigade: thank you for your service.
