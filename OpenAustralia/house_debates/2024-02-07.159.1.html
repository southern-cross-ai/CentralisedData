        residents receiving a Metal of the Order of Australia included Elizabeth O'Callaghan for service to education and Victor O'Callaghan for service to restorative practices. I know of their work for the Springwood East Timor Support Group, but they are also involved in many other groups in many community roles across

        Roberta Colbran, Bobby, was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>

         New South Wales Rural Fire Service
        </a>
        . During this time, Bobby has held many roles, including her current role of deputy captain. Now in her mid-80s, she has only fairly recently been banned from the truck, I'm told. Her medal is in recognition of the enormous hours and energy she continues to put into the vital Rural Fire Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrant Officer Paul Ernest Argus has been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_Service_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Conspicuous Service Cross
        </a>
        for his outstanding achievement in aircraft maintenance reform and other roles within the

        I'd also like to commend ex-Blue Mountains resident Noel Hiffernan on receiving an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        for his advocacy and service for people with a disability, which really means that he's been fighting for accessibility rights and equality of life for people with a disability since his own car accident in 1971, which resulted in midthoracic paraplegia. These are such deserving honours recipients, and I'm very proud to have them as residents or former residents of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate the Hawkesbury Council citizens of the year. Citizen of the Year Keith Acton: while he would rather not have been centre of attention, certainly deserved recognition for his 17 years of volunteering with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>

         Wiseman's Ferry
        </a>
        and Lower Macdonald brigades, not to mention his unpaid extra work at Wisemans Ferry Public School and arranging Anzac Day commemorations plus much more. Gemma King, who I first met when she was fundraising for youth mental health through Laps for Life—and she is now on the board of our new Hawkesbury headspace—is fittingly Young Citizen of the Year. It was a tie for the Local Hero Award between Scott Hinks, recognised for his big contribution to the Richmond Lions Club and a myriad of involvement in other issues, and Rochelle Miller, whose most recent advocacy with all levels of government was triggered by the floods which isolated her community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Portland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . She was instrumental in getting the issues resolved. Sportsperson of the Year Melissa Crane has made a huge contribution to Pitt Town Sports Club and the football club and managed to have eight girls from the club lead the Matildas into the

       </p>
       <p>
        The Kurrajong Nursing Home auxiliary, a caring community run aged-care facility, won the Community Organisation of the Year Award for its volunteers. Windsor High School's Thursday lunchtime interest group received the Arts and Cultural Award for offering an inclusive program to get students to try new things. To all the recipients, thank you for you passion, dedication and service. We are richer because of you.
