        I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. This bill forms the third element of the package of three bills that will introduce major reforms in the handling of corruption issues and other issues relating to misconduct in Australian government law enforcement. The government introduced this legislation late in March. The bills were referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for examination and report. I have already spoken generally about the committee’s review when introducing government amendments to the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2541" rel="nofollow">
         Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Bill 2006
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Before discussing the proposed amendments I would like to comment briefly on the committee’s recommendations 13 and 15, which are not expressly addressed in the amendments. Recommendation 13 proposes that the lower level disciplinary matters, categories 1 and 2, should be subject to internal review while more serious matters, category 3, should be the subject of external review—for example, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        . The government considers that adequate provision for review can be effectively achieved without express provision. An AFP internal review mechanism for category 1 and category 2 issues is planned. This does not require legislative backing, especially in view of the non-punitive character of the responses. There are existing mechanisms for external review under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 of decisions to terminate employment in response to recommendations arising from category 3 investigations. The proposed amendments of item 10 will ensure that these will be preserved. Review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is therefore not required.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recommendation 15 is that the bill clarify that the professional standards regime applies to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The government agrees in principle with the proposition that the commissioner should be expected to comply with professional standards; however, because of the unique position of the commissioner within the AFP and the regime established by the proposed new part 5 of the act, it is impractical to legislate specifically for this purpose. Under the AFP Act the commissioner may be dismissed by the Governor-General for misbehaviour. It is not desirable to define misbehaviour, but a failure to comply with professional standards that the commissioner requires others to meet would clearly be relevant to the possible use of the dismissal power.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments (2) to (5) and (9) remedy an omission from the bill. They effectively substitute references to ‘an AFP appointee’ for references to an AFP employee, a special member or a special protective service officer in the relevant sections of the AFP Act. This change helps to give effect to the government’s intention that the new professional standards regime should apply to all AFP appointees. The definition of AFP appointee that the bill will insert in the AFP Act will include not only AFP employees, special members and special protective service members but also a deputy commissioner, a person engaged overseas, a consultant or a contractor designated by the commissioner as an AFP employee and a secondee to the AFP.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (6) will remedy an omission from the bill by inserting a new item in schedule 1 expressly providing that the commissioner may at any time revoke a determination that an AFP employee is to perform duties at a place outside Australia. The amendment clarifies that the commissioner has power to recall an AFP employee from an overseas posting at any time despite any indication in the initial determination that the posting was intended to be for a specified period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (7) schedule 1, item 2 constitution of a unit undertaking professional standards functions: this item amends proposed new section 40RE of the AFP Act to provide that if the commissioner so directs, the head of the AFP professional standards unit is responsible directly either to a specified deputy commissioner, as at present, or a specified senior executive AFP employee of equivalent level. It will provide administrative flexibility in an organisation where non-sworn staff may now serve at all levels and reflects the fact that the regime administered by the professional standards unit governs the conduct of all AFP employees, not only sworn members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (8) partly implements the Senate committee’s recommendation 12. It requires the AFP Commissioner and the Ombudsman to try to make a determination as to particular kinds of conduct that are to be categories 1, 2 and 3 conduct for the purpose of the bill within three months after commencement of schedule 1. The committee recommended that the bill be amended to compel the Ombudsman and the commissioner to make a determination of categories of conduct within three months of the commencement of the act. The government’s view is that it is not practical to legislate to compel agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (10) implements the Senate committee’s recommendation 14 and will ensure the current position on review of action to terminate employment under section 28 is preserved. Section 69B of the AFP Act currently provides that the Workplace Relations Act, with certain exceptions, does not apply in relation to discipline of AFP employees. This does not preclude appeals under the Workplace Relations Act against termination of employment under section 28 of the AFP Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment to amendment (22) of schedule 3 of the bill would replace the reference to discipline in section 69B with reference to a matter covered by the proposed new part 5 of the AFP Act or any action taken in relation to a matter covered by that part. This amendment will clarify, by inserting an express provision, that the new wording of section 69B is not intended to preclude the operation of the Workplace Relations Act in relation to terminating employment of an AFP employee under section 28 after an investigation under part 5 of the Workplace Relations Act, if the Workplace Relations Act would have otherwise applied.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main purpose of amendments (1), (11) and (12) is to allow the impending amendment of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1969 by the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, which completed its passage through parliament on 13 June 2006. Amendments (25) to (30) of schedule 3 of the bill provide for an amendment to various provisions of part 3 of division 3 of the ASIO Act in its present form. Part 3 of division 3 deals with the special powers relating to terrorism offences. The relevant provisions of the ASIO Act are intended to ensure that persons in custody or detained for questioning under part 3 of division 3 are advised of and entitled to facilities to exercise their rights to complain about actions taken by the AFP, despite the general prohibition on their contacting outside persons. The rights referred to arise under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, which will be repealed by the present bill.

        The effect of the existing amendments (25) to (32) of schedule 3 of the bill would be to replace references to making a complaint to the Ombudsman under the complaints act with references to making a complaint to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act or giving information to the commissioner or an investigator under the proposed new part 5 of division 2 of the AFP Act.

        Amendment (11) would omit existing items 25 to 32 of schedule 3 and item 12 would substitute a new schedule 3A in two parts. Part 1 would replicate the omitted items from schedule 3. Part 2 would make similar amendments to the ASIO Act as amended by the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill. Item 1 amends the bill’s commencement provisions to ensure that, subject to the commencement date of this bill, part 1 of schedule 3A will operate before the commencement of the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill and part 2 of schedule 3A will operated thereafter. The opportunity has been taken to correct a small number of errors and omissions in the existing items 25 to 32 of schedule 3 and the process of translating them to schedule 3A. The details of these changes are set out in the explana

          We have a number of views on this range of amendments that have been moved together. There are those that Labor certainly commends, like amendment (10), which goes directly to implementing a recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. There are a number of others where we are still a little bit perplexed about the changes that are being moved. For example, we moved an amendment to the first bill which made sure that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Protective_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Protective Service
          </a>
          was not going to be included in the remit of the first bill and the work that the new commission will be able to do. Now we are moving amendments in this bill to make sure that the Australian Protective Service is going to be covered by the new professional standards that are in place. It seems to me that there is some inconsistency between these pieces of legislation, and moving these amendments at the last minute does not really give the opposition much opportunity to see if these are fitting appropriately together or not. But no doubt that attention will be given in another place.
         </p>
         <p>
          I might ask the Attorney if he is able to confirm, given the significant extent of the changes that are being proposed in this bill, whether he or his officers have taken the opportunity to talk to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Federal Police
          </a>
          Association about these amendments and whether there has been any consultation. I can see some nodding from the advisers box, which is a good sign. Obviously they are a key stakeholder and among the people who will be affected by this new regime, so it is worth while for us to get that information.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am also concerned about whether the Attorney is able to tell us about another amendment which I think he referred to—the last item—which means that some of the provisions will not commence until a later date, I think, given their interaction with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
           ASIO
          </a>
          Act. I am not sure why those provisions have not been given any attention. They were not part of the Senate committee’s review of this bill. The Attorney might be able to confirm whether the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security has been involved at all and how it is that the timing will work with those delayed provisions.
         </p>
         <p>
          That might be something that can be cleared up, but we obviously have some reservations about the fact that we have not had the opportunity to fully understand where these amendments from the government are coming from. If the Attorney can clarify for us, that would be useful. We will not stand in the way of them being moved in this House, obviously, but, in consideration of wanting to be able to get a substantially agreed position between the parties smoothly through both here and the Senate, it would be useful, if the Attorney cannot answer those questions now, to make sure that there are discussions between our offices before the debate in another place.

In relation to consideration by any other committee, I am informed there has not been. That means there has not been any consideration by the joint intelligence and security committee, but these amendments as proposed were a product of advice from those who work in this area.
