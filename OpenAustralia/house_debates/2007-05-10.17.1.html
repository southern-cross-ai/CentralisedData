        That this bill be now read a second time.

        This
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2774" rel="nofollow">
         bill
        </a>
        amends the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 by making changes to the governance arrangements of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).
       </p>
       <p>
        ACIAR is a statutory authority within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, and its activities are part of Australia’s aid program. ACIAR was established in 1982 to assist and encourage agricultural researchers in Australia to use their skills for the benefit of developing countries, while at the same time working to solve Australia’s own agricultural problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of the bill is to implement the government’s response to the Review of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Governance" rel="nofollow">
         Corporate Governance
        </a>
        of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders conducted by Mr John Uhrig. The government has been reviewing all statutory agencies in the context of Mr Uhrig’s recommendations to achieve the most effective accountability and governance structures across the whole of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has assessed ACIAR’s existing governance arrangements against the principles and recommendations of the Uhrig review. It considers that the current board of management structure is inconsistent with the executive management template recommended by Mr Uhrig for agencies covered by the Finance Management and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        1997 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA" rel="nofollow">
         FMA
        </a>
        Act).
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill creates the position of chief executive officer (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        ) in place of the current director. The CEO will be directly accountable to the minister for administrative and financial purposes under the FMA Act. In addition, the bill abolishes the board of management of the centre and establishes a seven-member expert commission. The commission, which will include the CEO, will provide expert policy and research advice in place of the current board. The current Policy Advisory Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAC" rel="nofollow">
         PAC
        </a>
        ), which includes key overseas stakeholders, will be retained. However, this bill will introduce amendments to ensure there will be no duplication of membership between the commission and the PAC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of a commission and the position of CEO will not alter the functions of ACIAR. ACIAR will retain its capacity for collective decision making, through the new commission, while bringing its management under the CEO. These changes are consistent with the executive management template recommended by the Uhrig review.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to thank the current and previous ACIAR boards. I am grateful for their commitment and expertise which have contributed enormously to enabling ACIAR to develop effective and practical research programs to assist developing country partners solve their agricultural problems and build research capacity. I look forward to working with the new commission when it is appointed under the provisions of this bill.
