       <p>
        I refer to your ruling today regarding my request as Manager of Opposition Business that an offensive remark be withdrawn. I draw your attention to the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        of 22 June 2006, page 72, where the former Leader of the Opposition stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You are better at vilifying refugees, Phil.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next entry is yours, saying, ‘Order!’ then the Leader of the House rising to his feet saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        may say so, that was a grubby remark and it should be withdrawn. It is offensive and it should be withdrawn.
       </p>
       <p>
        You then stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has been asked to withdraw that remark. The Leader of the Opposition will stand up and withdraw it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The former Leader of the Opposition did just that, Mr Speaker, and the House went on in an orderly fashion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I also draw your attention to the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        on 8 August 2006, which does not even record what the interjection was—it just says, ‘
        <i>
         Opposition members interjecting
        </i>
        ’. Again, the Leader of the House rose to his feet and said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Speaker, I heard the Leader of the Opposition use very offensive language against the minister for workplace relations and, under the standing orders which he claims to uphold, he should withdraw it.
       </p>
       <p>
        You called the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition responded ‘so that you know exactly what I said’. You then intervened and said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.
       </p>
       <p>
        That then occurred, Mr Speaker. That is precisely what happened on the floor of this chamber today—precisely.

         I think the member might come to his question and not debate it.

         </small>
         <p>
          I would ask that you examine the precedents that have occurred in the past, including your own rulings, Mr Speaker. Have a look at the tape and examine what occurred today and report back to the House as to what the standards will be in future if we are going to have the sort of orderly debate that I think the people of Australia expect and deserve from this House.

          <p>
           I take the question as a serious question that the Manager of Opposition Business has raised. I would make the point that the occupier of the chair is always asked to rule on an issue like that in the context of what was said. On this particular occasion I asked the Leader of the Opposition if he found the words offensive and he indicated that he did not. However, I am happy to discuss the matter further with the opposition—but I will not revisit the particular instance of today.
