       <p>
        I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that it concurs with the resolution of appointment of the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        , subject to the Senate’s proposed amendments. Given the length of the proposed resolution, I do not intend to read the terms of it. They will be recorded in the
        <i>
         Votes and Proceedings
        </i>
        and incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard.
        </i>
        Copies of the message have been placed on the table.

        The message read as follows—

       <p class="italic">

         These are largely technical amendments. They simply mean that there will be the appointment of a deputy chair, which is standard procedure when it comes to the creation of committees. It will change the quorum requirement from three to five members. The government believe this is an important committee. It will be chaired by the independent member for Lyne. The committee is very broad in terms of its scope of inquiry, and the government commends the resolution, as amended, to the House.
