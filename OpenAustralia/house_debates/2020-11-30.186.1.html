        Esperance is a tight-knit coastal town, and its sense of community and service is second to none. Given its isolation, the

        is greatly appreciated by the Esperance community, and several groups fundraise year-round to help keep the doctor flying. One of those groups is the Royal Flying Doctor Service Firewood Cutters. At the invitation of

        , I recently visited the firewood cutters to see firsthand this impressive initiative. I was warmly greeted by their president, Neil Livingstone, who gave me a tour of their set-up. Their wood yard is co-located on the property of McD Contracting, and the firewood cutters are supported by many other local businesses. On Monday and Wednesday mornings, you'll find a group of 28 retired cutters, along with a couple of shift workers, running three wood splitters, several chainsaws and a mobile saw bench. Together, the team donate their considerable talents and time to this worthy cause. I was blown away to hear that, so far this year, the sale of their firewood has resulted in over $85,000 in donations to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It was great to chat to Neil, David Ovans and

        about the importance of the Royal Flying Doctor Service to their community. I understand there is also a social aspect to the group, with the firewood cutters rewarded for their hard work with a beer and a barbecue after each shift. What a fantastic initiative, raising funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while fostering connection between their members and the local community. I commend the Esperance
