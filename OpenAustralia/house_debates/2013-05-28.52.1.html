         I thank the member for Greenway for her question and note that it was just a few weeks ago that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         was switched on in Blacktown. The member, who is a proud advocate of the Blacktown community and the NBN, was present. I note also the recent article from the
         <i>
          Blacktown Advocate
         </i>
         that said, 'Blacktown an NBN town divided.' That article spoke about how if the opposition policy gets up there will be some people in Blacktown with high-speed broadband and some people without high-speed broadband, some people with fibre technology and some people with copper technology to their house. The shadow minister for fraudband and the copper economy had this to say in the local paper about this. He acknowledged that the technology under their plan would need to be upgraded down the track. So it is now acknowledged that you would put in a second-rate system knowing that you are passing on to future generations the need to upgrade the system.

           He just doesn't get it. How awful, says the Leader of the Opposition. Why not try to get it right the first time and use 21st century technology rather than 19th century technology that was put in by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMG" rel="nofollow">
            PMG
           </a>
           ? That is where they are stuck. The problem is that those opposite will create a digital divide in communities right around the country. They think it is all about downloading but it is about uploading. This is as short-sighted as the famous quote of the late 1970s by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Olsen" rel="nofollow">
            Ken Olsen

              The shadow minister for the copper economy is on the ball. It might be that he gets into the 20th century before he gets to the 21st. The truth is that he was so embarrassed by his Leader of the Opposition when they launched the policy. Remember that? There is the Leader of the Opposition and

              . Is it an apparition, is it computer-generated? No idea. The rollout is happening and it is happening in Blacktown, it is happening in Marrickville today, it is happening in Vaucluse, Malcolm. They know the benefit of the

                  Minister, you have spoken about rolling out the

                  across Australia. Why is it important that we remove the digital divide that exists between regional and urban Australia?

                   I thank the member for her question. One of the great benefits of the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                    NBN
                   </a>
                   is overcoming the tyranny of distance that has made it more difficult to do business in regional Australia than in the CBDs of our capital cities. That is why new areas switched on to the NBN so far this year include Gungahlin, Toowoomba,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   and Gosford. Right around the country in regional communities the NBN is overcoming that tyranny of distance. That is why it is important that it be rolled out throughout regional communities so as to overcome the digital divide.

                  <p>
                   But there is something even worse from the opposition which comes to pricing policy. We have ensured uniform national wholesale pricing so that, whether you live in Coffs Harbour or you live in Camperdown, you do it for the same price. But under the opposition policy that would go. The National Party pretend leader,

                   </a>
                   , told the Senate less than two years ago, 'The National Party believes in uniform pricing absolutely.' Well, they have been pretty quiet in recent times. And

                  <p class="italic">

                   will deliver high-speed broadband to rural and regional areas, or they are being deliberately deceitful and are trying to trick the public into supporting a plan they know is flawed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Indeed it is a flawed plan. It is 'fraudband' and we need to make sure that the whole of Australia benefits from the NBN.
