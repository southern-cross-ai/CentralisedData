       <p>
        On Saturday, 5 May the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollondilly_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Wollondilly Shire
        </a>
        and the Macarthur community united behind the grieving children of the late Anna Dudas at her 'Night of Nights' Memorial Benefit Concert. Anna was a much loved member of the Wollondilly and Macarthur Community. She was a single mum of four children—Adrian, Tahlia, Ashton and Skye, aged from 16 to three. Anna was diagnosed with terminal cancer in November 2010 and passed away on 29 February this year after a brave and determined battle against all odds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to express my thanks to the organisers of the memorial benefit—in particular, Dale Burridge and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA" rel="nofollow">
         SMA
        </a>
        Productions, who put on the show; Brooke Hilton, who rallied the community; and Hayley Harrington, who supported Anna and her children from day one.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to give special thanks to all the performers who donated their time and talents, local businesses which donated prizes, and the Campbelltown Catholic Club, which donated the venue, staff, advertising, pamphlets, tickets, food and drinks and production costs. Without the support of the club, this event could not have happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank the generosity of Damn Good productions, which covered all the video productions costs so the children can remember this massive gesture of support from their community forever. More than 680 people turned up to support these children, who lost their mother in such tragic circumstances, and to celebrate the wonderful life of Anna. I am extremely proud to represent a community that is so generous not just with its time and money but also with its love and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rest in peace, Anna; you will always be remembered.
       </p>
