       <p>
        This chamber has been rocked in recent days by the passing of one of its members. The member for Dunkley lost her battle with cancer just one day after my own community of Barker began grieving the loss of much-loved and long-serving councillor, Rhonda Centofanti, who also lost the fight with cancer this week. I don't think there are many in the Riverland who would not have been touched in some way by Rhonda. She was a force to be reckoned with. Her determination was surpassed only by her willingness to serve her community and the love she had for her extended family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rhonda wasn't only the matriarch of the Centofanti family. She was a community leader, steadfast in her dedication to making the Riverland a better place to live. Serving the community formally as a councillor for a herculean 27 years, she worked in local schools across the region and was a member of so many local community organisations that time allocated for my speech doesn't allow me to list them all. Rhonda was also a passionate cook, who would inevitably turn up at one of our community events with her famous cakes for all to share.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am honoured to have known Rhonda. I am honoured to have served the community of the Riverland alongside her. My deepest condolences go to her husband, Jack; her children, Paolo, Michael and Carla; as well as her extended family and friends. Vale, Rhonda Centofanti.
