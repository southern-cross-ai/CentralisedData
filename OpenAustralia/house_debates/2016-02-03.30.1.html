       <p>
        I am delighted to inform the House that a former student of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Church_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston Church Grammar School
        </a>
        , in my electorate of Bass, is one of three outstanding young Tasmanians awarded 2016 Rhodes scholarships. James Haw is currently a cavalry officer serving in the 2nd/14th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Light Horse Regiment
        </a>
        . He grew up in Launceston and, after completing his schooling, was accepted for officer training in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        . James graduated second in his class at Duntroon after graduating from the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" rel="nofollow">
         Bachelor of Arts
        </a>
        first-class honours degree and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         University Medal
        </a>
        in Politics. James joins an elite list of people who have been awarded Rhodes scholarships and is one of the very few from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the pleasure of spending time with James recently in Launceston, discovering that he is an avid South-East Asianist. He has attended the Indonesian army military academy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitas_Airlangga" rel="nofollow">
         Universitas Airlangga
        </a>
        â€”the second-oldest university in Indonesia. At Oxford, James will study a Master of Philosophy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Anthropology" rel="nofollow">
         Social Anthropology
        </a>
        , aimed at better understanding the impact of military operations in the world's tribal regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Interestingly, James is the 17th student from the Launceston Church Grammar School to become a Rhodes scholar. I congratulate him and the school on this wonderful achievement. I know his family in Launceston and many school friends will draw great pride from his outstanding academic career. I am sure the Australian Defence Force will benefit from his studies as a Rhodes scholar.
