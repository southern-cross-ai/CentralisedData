        () (): [by video link] I'm over it; Australians are over it. We're all sick of the divisive spin. Why can't the Prime Minister just get on with the job—all of them? He literally tore down a prime minister to get this job. It's time he did it properly. His refusal to secure diverse vaccine supplies early enough has left Australians dangerously exposed. His refusal to condemn his own government MPs for comments contrary to health advice is simply horrifying. We have hundreds of new cases of COVID-19 every day across the nation.

Before that he allowed his Treasurer to hold WA and other states to ransom, threatening to pull the economic rug from under us if lockdowns or restrictions are imposed after reaching 80 per cent vaccinations for only those aged 16 and above. We won't forget that the Morrison government didn't provide financial support for our last lockdowns in WA, either. Everyone wants us to come out of this pandemic situation as soon as possible, but we don't forget that the Morrison government's handling of vaccines and quarantine, as well as being anti lockdown, is why we're not coming out of this yet as a nation. The PM needs to stop responding after the fact. These are real people's lives that are being lost or irreparably damaged, yet he's still working out—
