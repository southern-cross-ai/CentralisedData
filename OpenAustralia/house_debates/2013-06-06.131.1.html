        I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the electorate of Gorton has produced another round of exceptional young leaders, who have been recognised with the Gordon Young Leaders Award. The Gorton Young Leaders Award recognises young people who have shown exceptional commitment to public service in their final years of secondary college, specifically through involvement in voluntary work, student leadership or community service. This is the fourth year we have run the awards, and I am consistently impressed by the calibre of the recipients. Fourteen former year 12 students from across seven schools were awarded the Gorton Young Leaders Award based on their achievements during 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        The achievements of all 14 prize winners were diverse, spanning a range of worthy causes. One student was an academically successful year-12 house captain who volunteered his time on the college's partnership with Sunshine Hospital. Another student established and coordinated a mass tutoring program at a school. She was also a member of the student executive and involved with the college's after-school care program. Another was a leader in her school's gay-straight alliance, leading the charge against homophobic and transphobic bullying. Another student volunteered his time with local musicians and dancers' crews to teach and engage disconnected youth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The winners for 2012 were as follows: from

        I am truly pleased to be able to say that so many bright and capable young leaders call Melbourne's west and the electorate of Gorton their home. Each and every successful recipient here demonstrated an exceptional commitment to active public leadership within their schools and their communities. They should all feel very proud of their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some weeks ago I convened an afternoon tea and presentation at my electorate office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Springs
        </a>
        to recognise the achievements of these young leaders. Students were presented with certificates and a small prize. It was a wonderful opportunity to meet with these capable young adults, as well as their parents, friends, principals and teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now enrolled in courses at university,

        and other educational institutions, these young leaders certainly have very bright futures ahead of them. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating the young leaders who were the recipients of this award on their efforts and wish them every success for the future.
