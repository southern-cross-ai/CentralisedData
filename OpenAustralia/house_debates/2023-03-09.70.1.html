        likes to think of itself as the party of business but, on issue after issue, business is showing leadership and leaving the coalition behind. On the Voice, companies like Wesfarmers are taking the field to support the Voice, while the coalition are sitting on the sidelines and can't even decide if they support it. On climate, businesses are moving forward towards net zero with concrete plans and targets, but those opposite are moving backwards and failing to offer business the certainty they so badly need. On gender equity, many businesses are achieving gender equity in their executive ranks and boards by setting clear targets and making leaders accountable, while those opposite fall further and further behind community expectations.

        Those opposite like to think of themselves as the party of free enterprise. Well, enterprising businesses are freely walking away from them every single day! Businesses are walking away from them on the Voice, they're walking away from them on climate change and they're walking away from them on fairness and gender equity. It is sad to see a party lose and be outgrown by its core constituency. The reality is that if the coalition doesn't even understand business then they have no business standing in the way of the government's progressive agenda.
