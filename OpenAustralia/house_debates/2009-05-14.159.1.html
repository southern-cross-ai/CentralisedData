        I rise today to inform members of some of the activities and achievements of volunteers in my electorate of Robertson. As members are aware, it is National Volunteer Week. This is the time when we recognise and applaud the work of the volunteers in our community. Volunteer Week was launched by Senator Ursula Stephens, the Parliamentary Secretary for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
         Social Inclusion
        </a>
        and Parliamentary Secretary for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Sector" rel="nofollow">
         Voluntary Sector
        </a>
        . I want to put on the record her great commitment in this policy area. I get very positive feedback from all sections of the community, particularly from volunteer organisations, about how much she has achieved and what great work she has done.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year’s theme—Everyday people, extraordinary contribution—sums up the invaluable contribution that volunteers make to communities across Australia. One in three Australians is a volunteer. Together the nation’s five million volunteers give more than 700 million hours per year to helping others. The picture on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , where the electorate of Robertson is located, is no different and it certainly reflects the national scene. Volunteering has been integral in maintaining the social and community fabric of the Central Coast for generations. Organisations such as the

        </a>
        and the

        form much of the backbone of our coastal communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to make special mention of a number of volunteers in my electorate who will be receiving certificates of appreciation to mark Volunteer Week. These seven people were nominated by community groups across the coast. They are among the unsung heroes of my region. I thank them all personally for their tireless contribution to making the coast a better place to live, work and bring up the next generation of children.

         Phegans Bay
        </a>
        is the Secretary of The Bays Community Group. She runs the local community breakfasts, the kids discos and the bush dances. I, of course, cannot mention her without mentioning the president of that group, Bob Puffett. He does endless work in the community. He distributes the newsletter, works for the university and even mows the lawns that the council forgets in its rounds. He is certainly an amazing fellow and works closely with Thea.

        The selfless efforts of these people add a tremendous amount to the social good of the Central Coast. They make invaluable contributions to assisting our children, youth and seniors. They give their time and experience to community groups and resident associations. Their efforts are focused not on promoting their own interests but on the interests and wellbeing of others and on the betterment of the Central Coast. They certainly make our world a better place to live in.
