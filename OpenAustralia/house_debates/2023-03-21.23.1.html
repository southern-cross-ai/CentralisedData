       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to stand here today and pay tribute to the wonderful Dr Brian Bowring, AM. Dr Bowring recently marked his last day as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        , with the majority of his career—almost 40 years, in fact—spent as a local doctor in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        . Graduating from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        in 1979, Dr Bowring spent some time with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Broken Hill
        </a>
        before settling into George Town. In addition to being a dedicated GP, Dr Bowring has been a passionate advocate for rural medicine and general practice, holding a number of positions, including as chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Health_Education_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Health Education Foundation
        </a>
        board. In 2013, Dr Bowring was awarded an AM for his significant service to medicine in rural and regional areas and as a general practitioner. Former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Rural Health Education Foundation Don Perlgut praised Dr Bowring, saying: 'He has been a tireless campaigner for and practitioner of rural health. His ability to connect with rural and remote health practitioners is unparalleled.' Over the years, Dr Bowring has also supported community, participating in Movember and shaving his head a few years ago in support of a Relay for Life team, started by his patient Tania Flanagan, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2009. Above all, Dr Bowring is a loved husband, father and grandfather and someone I admire very much. Happy retirement, Dr B.
