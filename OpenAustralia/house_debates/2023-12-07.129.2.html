       <p>
        Before we leave, I too would like to make some final comments. First and foremost, on behalf of my colleagues and particularly the Speaker's panel, I'd like the Clerk, Ms Claressa Surtees, for all the work that you do and for your calm stewardship and sage advice in assisting me in my role as Speaker. In addition to the Clerk, I'd like to pass on my thanks, on behalf of all members, to the hardworking professional staff of the Department of the House of Representatives, including our wonderful chamber attendants, committee office staff, the Serjeant-at-Arms Office team, finance, people strategies, Information Management Office, Procedure Office staff and the Table Office. Thank you for the work that you do to ensure that this chamber runs as smoothly as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of all members, I'd also like to make special note and a thank you to Ms Susan Cardell after 35 years of distinguished service to the department. Ms Cardell started in the department in 1988 as an admin trainee in the Procedure Office. She was awarded the Australia Day Achievement Medallion in 2016 and is finishing her career as secretary to the parliament's largest committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I was honoured to be accompanied by Ms Cardell on a parliamentary delegation overseas to Israel earlier this year, and I can attest to her professionalism and work ethic.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the House, I also want to thank the members of the Department of Parliamentary Services. We're enormously grateful for everyone who supports us in the building, from our cleaners, security officers to building services, catering, broadcasting and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        support. We appreciate that you only hear from us when things go wrong, but we unreservedly appreciate and acknowledge your service of the building and its occupants.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the press gallery, thank you for what you do in this building as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my fellow members of parliament and to all your staff, it's been a massive year. Thank you for your hard work and contribution in this place. Most importantly, thank you for the kindness that you've shown me. We all have such an important role to play in creating good legislation and maintaining Australia's great democracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Deputy Speaker, thank you for your support and good humour throughout the year. Thank you to the Second Deputy Speaker and all members of the Speaker's Panel, who do an excellent job in keeping the chamber running.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to give a big shout-out and thanks to the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip and your teams. We simply couldn't do our jobs without you.
       </p>
       <p>
        My final thank you is to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Nationals, the Leader of the House, the Manager of Opposition Business and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I'm going to miss your texts, our chats and, of course, your interjectionsâ€”but I know they'll be waiting for me when I return next year!
       </p>
       <p>
        It's been a busy and demanding year for all of us and I hope you all get the opportunity to take a well-deserved break before we come back in 2024. I wish you and your families a very merry and safe Christmas.
       </p>
