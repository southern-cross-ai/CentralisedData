        I rise today to speak about a local business success story. It's an amazing story of achievement by a family owned business that is helping people, particularly young women, to gain valuable skills and confidence to realise their dreams every year.

        Beauty Academy is Australia's largest and most prestigious registered training provider for services in the beauty therapy industry. Each year, the French Beauty Academy accepts over 2,000 students into training programs in the areas of beauty services, dermal therapy, laser, make-up, style, massage and medispa therapies. In fact, one in six beauty students in Australia is studying at The French.

        French students, or Frenchies, as they are known, learn theory and practical skills in luxurious salon inspired facilities that are designed to both educate and inspire, and they certainly do. The academy's reputation for quality and professionalism means more than 90 per cent of dual diploma graduates secure a job before course completion. That is exactly what we need to be happening right across the industry and all industries. I was delighted to open The French's Robina campus nearly a decade ago, and last week I had the pleasure of officially launching their newest flagship program, the Future of Beauty, as they partner with the biggest names in skin and device technologies to co-develop an industry leading and cutting edge skin focused program.

        Australia's spend on cosmetic treatments has topped $1 billion, and their popularity continues to rise. Our spend is amongst the highest in the world, and a growing number of Australians are incorporating cosmetic procedures into their beauty and grooming routines. As a very proud advocate for the advancement of women in education and providing more opportunities for women in our labour force, I'm so pleased to witness the pathways for the next generation of beauty entrepreneurs being created. Despite beauty and aesthetics being a billion dollar industry in this country, it's not a profession that gets a lot of discussion in this place, so it's important to recognise those who work in this field, delivering an in-demand service. The skills acquired are often highly technical and many are actually an art form that take study, practice and determination.

        Finally, I'd like to take a minute to recognise and thank the French family—Sherelle, Alan, Luke and David—who have created so many opportunities for others through their business and who are constantly giving back to the community as well. I'm proud that this
