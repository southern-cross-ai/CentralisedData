        was removed, and a large and beautiful part of the northern Eurobodalla shire was added. It is a difficult time for many residents, as they have always been part of the Eden-Monaro. Dr Peter Hendy and I are working together to help the transition process. It is also important to the local residents that they are able to describe their priorities and their needs.

        The first meeting was an introduction by the team from Regional Development Australia Far South Coast to meet the presidents of the regional chambers of commerce. There is a very collegiate atmosphere with these amazing small and medium business owners.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a great overnight stay at Alison Miers's Bay Breeze Boutique Motel, I was off to my first full day in the new part of the electorate, meeting with Eurobodalla mayor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and a more detailed discussion with executives Allan Rutherford and Harvey Doberer from the

         Batemans Bay
        </a>
        Chamber of Commerce. Following that discussion, I was informed of a long list of projects to work on and advocate for. The projects are wide-ranging, including an upgrade to the airport at Moruya, seen as a potential business and employment growth hub, and the need for an indoor swimming facility, and of course, improvement to local roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        No time to stop, as I became acquainted with the local radio team at 2EC. They are very enthusiastic, and it was a pleasure to meet them. Last stop that day in Batemans Bay was the Paleo Cafe for a fabulous juice before travelling down the highway to Moruya for a meeting with the chamber president Steve Picton, again discussing local needs.

        editor Lei Parker was keen to find out about my priorities for the region, before I met the

        , at the beautiful Tuross Boatshed &amp; Cafe. Tuross Head aims to increase their tourism capacity and they are looking at every possible avenue. Jeannie and Dave Brewer added the concept of a performing arts centre as a project to pursue in Batemans Bay. This has been a long-term project, and I am keen to learn more about its benefits to the region.
       </p>

        The next visit was the beginning of my village visits six-monthly schedule, starting out at the Bakehouse Cafe in Batemans Bay, and what a start it was. Annette Beesley from the

        Employment Services was holding her World's Greatest Shave event, and I am sure we would all say she is a brave woman, raising over $2,000 for leukaemia. I was honoured to be sharing the same space with her—such a special and generous person.
       </p>
       <p>
        Malua Bay IGA was the next stop, meeting residents to find out what improvements they would like. Following this, I met with

        at the Batehaven inclusive playground. The vision for this area is simply absolutely inspiring, with speciality equipment, great soft-fall climbing equipment, swings and rockers—all with a fenced enclosure so parents can relax knowing their children are safe. This is especially important for parents of children with autism, so they can fully utilise the recreation for their whole families.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project is terrific, and was being well used as stage 1. It is certainly a place of practical vision. Thank you to the Eurobodalla community for sharing your dreams and aspirations.
