       <p>
        Today I rise to acknowledge five ordinary people from my electorate who have done extraordinary things and were recently acknowledged in the King's Birthday honours list. In no particular order, firstly, I'd like to commend Mrs Sandra Johnston
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for an honour achieved for her services to the local community through a number of volunteer organisations like Lifeline, BreastScreen Queensland and particularly the establishment of the Women's Cancer Support Group Gold Coast. Secondly, I'd like to commend Mr Ian Langdon OAM, who was awarded for his contribution to the community as the chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast Hospital
        </a>
        , health board and Autism Queensland, and additionally for his contributions to the primary industry sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge Dr Philip Moses AM, who was honoured for his services to the veterinary profession as a doctor, administrator and educator. Professor Moses pioneered many surgeries using techniques that are used in koalas and kangaroos. Further, I'd like to commend Professor Alexander Brown for his services and contributions to the law and to public policy, particularly to whistleblower protection. Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to commend Mr Leonard Kennedy OAM for his services to the community through emergency response organisations. Leonard was the founding member of the Upper Flagstone Rural Fire Brigade and has served for nearly 50 years. None of these people go about their tasks seeking accolades, but I thank them for their contribution.
