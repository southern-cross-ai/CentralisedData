        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House about how Australia's creative industries are driving jobs, economic growth and promoting Australia's reputation overseas as a dynamic and innovative country?

         I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. In wishing her a happy birthday, I thank her for her support of our creative industries and, particularly, her support for the National Science and Innovation Agenda strategy that was released by the Prime Minister last December.

         Australians are amongst the most creative and talented people on earth. Our international reputation for creativity and innovation was further enhanced last night at the film industry's most prestigious awards, the

         I know that the member for Lindsay will be delighted with the success of this film for part of the post-apocalyptic film was actually done in Lindsay in a sand mine in Penrith Lakes. I know that the people of Lindsay were delighted by the filming and post-production work that was done in the electorate because, as it has been estimated, the filming and post-production work generated about $80 million in production expenditure and employed about 2,000 people. Also, 3,000 Australian businesses were used to provide goods and services.
