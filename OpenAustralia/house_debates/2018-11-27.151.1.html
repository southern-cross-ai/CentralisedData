        the wet season is almost here. It has mostly brought heat and humidity so far, but some good storms as well as some good rain. This season is known as the balnba season in the traditional language of the area I represent, which is the language of the Larrakia people. Balnba means 'the rainy season'. The Larrakia people are the traditional owners of the Greater Darwin region, and, even though their borders extend 50 kilometres or so inland, they are known as a saltwater people. The Larrakia, of course, have an extremely important role to play in shaping Darwin and, indeed, Palmerston and the Litchfield shire—the greater area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to place on the record my support for the parts of the recently signed Darwin City Deal that enhance Larrakia culture in the Greater Darwin area. In partnership with the Larrakia people, all levels of government will collaborate to showcase and celebrate Larrakia culture and to support the Larrakia people's economic development aspirations. They will do this through support to facilitate a Larrakia cultural centre where Larrakia people can meet and can, importantly, share their knowledge and promote their rich culture to both Greater Darwin residents and to visitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further support will be provided to improve understanding of Larrakia cultural protocols, and this will form part of a suite of outreach services known as Larrakia Nation Assist, which also includes the day patrol and Territory Connect. The Larrakia Host program will work with the Larrakia day patrol and employ six Larrakia—and other Aboriginal people too. Larrakia Host will promote the Larrakia culture to tourists, visitors and local residents. It will provide a referral service to other programs, including the day patrol. It will remind visitors from other communities about the types of behaviours that are acceptable on Larrakia country. The aim of the program is to boost tourism and employment opportunities for Aboriginal people whilst preserving and promoting Larrakia culture.

        Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting a participant in the Australian National Internships Program, Charlotte Maybery-Reupert. I talked with Charlotte prior to her starting the internship with me, and she was keen to do something that would really be important for my electorate, for Greater Darwin, in terms of its relationship with its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people. As you're well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, language is a very strong element of culture, so I asked her whether her research project could look into the revitalisation of the Larrakia language.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the Larrakia, language is more than a method of communication, of course; it's a storehouse of knowledge about a great ancient culture. For the Larrakia people, preserving their language is an important means of cultural preservation and the maintenance of their identity as it gets passed from generation to generation. But as non-Larrakia people get the opportunity to learn aspects of this language, it also has a great role in reconciliation. To Charlotte, the ANIP intern that was with me, I say thank you. Your work is going to greatly assist me in assisting the Larrakia to revive their language.

        Because we need to be thinking of the next generations of young people, I also put on the record my admiration for the work that's done by the

        . I've had the privilege in recent weeks to attend many of the graduation ceremonies for the year 12s. It's a humbling and emotional experience. There were no dry eyes in those ceremonies, hearing from the year 12s about how they could never have seen themselves completing year 12 but for the assistance of these programs. I acknowledge those 2018 graduates of these important programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first acknowledge those who completed year 12 through the Casuarina Clontarf Academy: William Anabtowi,
