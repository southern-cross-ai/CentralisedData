        The Shortland electorate is a coastal electorate. The eastern border of the entire electorate is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and so part of the identity of the Shortland electorate is intrinsically linked to the beaches along that border. The safety of those beaches is maintained by the surf lifesaving movement. The surf lifesaving clubs within the Shortland electorate play a vital and important role. Because of the quality of those beaches and the environment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">

        , state championships are often held within the Shortland electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within the last month, both the junior and the senior state lifesaving championships have been held at Blacksmiths Beach, with the Belmont Swansea Surf Life Saving Club being responsible for them. On many occasions, the Belmont Swansea Surf Life Saving Club has hosted the junior and the senior state lifesaving championships. Their ability to organise and conduct an event of this magnitude is second to none. On every occasion when the championships have been held at Blacksmiths Beach, the club has ensured that the event flows without a hitch. I was really pleased to attend the presentation at these championships and to see how all levels of government were prepared to work together so that the event was successful. I congratulate the executive and all the members of the club for the fine job that they did in organising the championships. I put on record that they will be held there again next year.

        On the previous weekend, Caves Beach Surf Life Saving Club had their ‘Ocean Swim’, which has become a renowned event and involves competitors from all around the state. It was yet again a very successful event and really showcased the wonderful beaches and the wonderful environment of the Shortland electorate. That same weekend, I attended Redheads

        Club, where they had the junior surf lifesaving club presentation. There were hundreds of young people there who were involved in the club and were learning about surf lifesaving and beach safety and at the same time learning what it was like to be a member of a volunteer organisation that gives so much to the community. I would like to formally congratulate all of the surf lifesaving clubs within the Shortland electorate and throughout the whole of Australia.
