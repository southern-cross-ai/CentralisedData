       <p>
        On the weekend of 20 and 21 June I had the pleasure of attending the annual Truffle Kerfuffle in the town of Manjimup in the far south-west of my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        . This event, now in its fourth year, highlights not only the quality of the southern forests' black truffles but also the amazing range of horticultural produce, fine wines, beef and dairy produce of the area, marketed under the Genuinely Southern Forests brand.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year's event was attended by in excess of 3,500 people over two days and featured long-table lunches and dinners, showcasing the fabulous 'black gold' local truffles, as well as local wine and produce. There were over 60 exhibitors selling and promoting delicious locally-grown food and wine, eight cooking masterclasses and the ever-popular truffle hunts. This year, 18 chefs of international renown contributed to the festival including Chicago's Michelin two-star chef Curtis Duffy and popular

        , as well as interstate and home-grown WA master chefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This highly successful event was the culmination of months of planning and preparation all done by volunteers who receive no personal reward other than the satisfaction of promoting the wonderful produce of the Warren-Blackwood region. I want to particularly recognise the Truffle Kerfuffle committee, led by the inspirational Sonia Porter and her husband Luke, who in the last month have been working 24/7 preparing for the festival. They were supported by committee members Tracey Hutcheson, Gavin Booth, Ben Blakers,

        and many other volunteers who assisted at the event. Jeremy and Kelly Beissel once again provided the wonderful venue by the waters of

        . I congratulate Sonia and her committee on their delectable event in 2014 and look forward to the gourmet delights of next year's Truffle Kerfuffle.
