        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        residents, protesting against the closure, at the end of June this year, of the Robina Mail Delivery Centre on Ron Penhaligon Way.

        This petition of residents of McPherson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        draws to the attention of the House to the announced closure of the Robina Delivery Centre, Queensland
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to: urge the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        to use his power under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        Act to consult with the Australia Post Board regarding the closure of the Robina Delivery Centre, located in Robina Queensland, on the grounds that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        *it is located within a retail precinct where businesses rely on its services; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        *it provides postal services to a large number of local businesses and people, particularly senior and elderly citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 300 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition has been assessed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions as compliant with standing orders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The closure of the mail delivery centre will affect numerous small businesses who rely on the business of local residents and also post office box holders who come to collect and drop off their mail. Residents and post office box holders, including many older Australians, will now have to travel further to pick up large mail and parcels or to collect mail from their post office box. The fact that there are 300 signatories to this petition shows that there is real concern within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to place on record that local newsagent Tony Keilar also facilitated the petition and I thank him for his work and his commitment to keeping the Robina Mail Delivery Centre open.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that Australia Post should have more broadly consulted with the local community to ensure that any changes to postal services in the area would not disadvantage local residents and existing small businesses. I call on the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to take note of the concerns as outlined in the petition and to consult with Australia Post immediately.
