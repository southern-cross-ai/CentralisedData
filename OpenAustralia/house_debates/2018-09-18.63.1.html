        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's answers about bullying in his government. The Minister for Women has said that government members were subject to threats, intimidation and bullying. More than a quarter of Liberal women MPs and senators agree. Today the Prime Minister said he was 100 per cent confident that bullying is not an issue in his government. Does the Prime Minister stand by his answer? Is he telling the Minister for Women and the members for Chisholm, Gilmore and Curtin and others that the bullying just didn't happen?

         As I remarked earlier today, when I have engaged with the members of my team about this issue, the issues that they have raised went to matters within the party organisation, and I have requested that the party organisation put in place a process that can deal confidentially and a rigorous process to deal with complaints in the party organisation. Within the federal parliamentary party, the way welfare issues are dealt with is through the party whips. The member for Forrest has been doing the job for 11 years, and she does an outstanding job, with her other whips, in caring for the welfare of the Liberal members of this House. That is exactly the same process as the member for Sydney has acknowledged occurs when it comes to the Labor Party in this place as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         It only begs the question: they're entitled to come and put these matters, of course, but they need to have a look at what's happening in their own case. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         candidate for Hasluck, Lauren Palmer, quit as the candidate in July of this year amid an outbreak of fresh factional warfare within the party. And despite the former ALP candidate citing health reasons for her withdrawal:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         One source said Ms Palmer had been "bullied" into resigning and had been treated badly by Labor figures, some of whom believed she was running a poor campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another Labor source stated the candidacy was never embraced by many senior Labor figures in WA. I suspect it was the blokes, especially those within the powerful left-wing United Voice union.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then we have the case of the member for Lindsay, and I welcome her back to the chamber. The Leader of the Opposition couldn't even bring himself to acknowledge that there were issues going on with the member for Lindsay. He had the 'I know nothing' defence, while the member for Grayndler knew all about it. I'm sure the member for Watson knew all about it. The member for McMahon knew all about it. I suspect the member for Sydney knew all about it. But what was it from the Leader of the Opposition? As usual, his ears were painted on when it came to listening to the concerns of his own members and, indeed, the concerns of the Australian people.
