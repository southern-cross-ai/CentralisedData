       <p>
        Last week I travelled to the northern parts of my electorate, namely to Mackay, Sarina and Walkerston. In Mackay I visited the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, located at the port of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Hay Point
        </a>
        , 38 kilometres south of Mackay in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . The terminal is a key player in the world's global coal export market and it's critical to the economic prosperity of Queensland and Australia. The terminal operates every day of the year, exporting thermal and met coal from Central Queensland's Bowen Basin mines to more than 25 countries around the world. While the terminal's primary purpose is to export coal, the operators are also focused on creating a sustainable environmental future and to enrich the local area. Seeing firsthand their level of dedication to the local community and to the environment was staggering. The Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal also spends significant time and effort in supporting local community groups, organisations and clubs. I want to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        Steve Rae and Kel Lockyer for taking the time to show me around the terminal.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Sarina I visited Ultra Coral, a world renowned supplier of sustainable, rare and exotic coral colonies. They are passionate about ensuring the long-term health of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        and corals all over the world. Ultra Coral was successful in applying for a grant from the federal government's Energy Efficient Communities Program. They received $20,000 to upgrade their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED" rel="nofollow">
         LED
        </a>
        lights, which are essential to the growing of coral. Their facility houses one of the largest selections of coral varieties in Australia. They are moving into new premises just outside of Sarina to expand their operations and for better access to the southern islands and reefs. I wish them the best of luck in their move. I also want to thank Ivy and Barbara for giving me a fantastic tour and I can't wait to get back there.
       </p>

        I also paid a visit to Kingsley, from the West Tigers Leagues Club in Walkerston. The club was a victim of a vicious ram-raid in the early hours of Wednesday 6 January this year. Early estimates of the damage ranges in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The raid damaged doors, walls and ceilings and it destroyed the reception area. Last year, 2020, was a challenging year for the Wests Tigers Leagues Club—and, indeed, challenging for every club, restaurant and pub in Australia—during the pandemic. For all the damage, the robbers left with nothing. This heartless attack could not have come at a worse time. But Kingsley and his team worked extremely hard to get the club to a safe state for customers to come back to. They were back open in a couple of days to serve the locals. The community responded by returning to the club in massive numbers to offer their support and ongoing patronage. Local clubs play an important part in our community, and the Wests Tigers Leagues Club are no exception. I wish Kingsley and his team the best of luck in the future. I have no doubt I'll be back soon to support the club as well.
