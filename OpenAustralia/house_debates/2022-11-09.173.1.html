        The Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022 contains important amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Atomic Energy Act
        </a>
        1953. These amendments put in place a number of measures important for securing the rehabilitation and eventual closure of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_Uranium_Mine" rel="nofollow">
         Ranger Uranium Mine

        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . This is a goal shared by government, the mine's operator and its traditional owners. Amendments will ensure that Energy Resources Australia, Ranger's long-standing operator, remain authorised to conduct approved rehabilitation and monitoring activities at Ranger for as long as is needed and for

        to demonstrate it has achieved the high standards of environmental rehabilitation that have long applied to the site. I thank the member for Aston for his speech yesterday and I'm very glad that the bill enjoys bipartisan support. I was happy to hear the member talk about the allowances for a progressive closeout, which is something that makes me and all involved very proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority created under this legislation allows for sections of the Ranger mine to be progressively returned to traditional owners as they are rehabilitated. I know all those in the chamber recognise Ranger's rehabilitation as a priority and look forward to seeing Ranger becoming a world-class example of mine rehabilitation. I want to note I visited the site recently and have seen the work that is currently being undertaken. I thank all those involved in that very hard work under quite trying conditions near Jabiluka in the Northern Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I want to thank ERA, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Land_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Land Council
        </a>
        and the Mirarr people for the close engagement on this bill. I commend this bill to the chamber and to the House.

        Question agreed to.

        Bill read a second time.

       <p>
        Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.
