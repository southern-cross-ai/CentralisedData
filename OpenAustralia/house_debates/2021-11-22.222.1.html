        It was an absolute pleasure to visit local Bennelong community transport provider Stryder last Friday. Stryder has just purchased a new Toyota commuter van through a Stronger Communities Program round 6 grant. It was gratifying to see the benefit this grant has created. I sat in the driver's seat, inhaled the brand-new-car smell we're all familiar with and love, and nearly drove the van right out of the depot to give it a little test drive. It took Stryder board member Craig Chung and

        Craig and Virginia said COVID had impacted the organisation severely, as vulnerable people were not able to use community transport services, and this made them even more isolated and vulnerable.

Stryder is named after the
