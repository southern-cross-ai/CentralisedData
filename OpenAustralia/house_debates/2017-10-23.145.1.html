       <p>
        I am delighted to move this motion today to recognise the extraordinary success of the New Colombo Plan. I would like to start by paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who devised and implemented the plan. Not only does the plan partner with our neighbours in the region; it provides incredible educational and life experiences for our university students and builds relationships in countries from India to Indonesia, Bangladesh to Burma and Pakistan to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, more than ever, our nation must strengthen its relationships with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific. The emerging prominence of these economies and their growing middle class demands that Australia builds a thorough understanding of our region. This knowledge must permeate all of our institutions, from government to business and throughout the public. The New Colombo Plan, devised and executed by our foreign minister, is a signature and forward-thinking initiative of the coalition government that works towards these aims and, while doing so, provides life-changing educational experiences for some of our best and brightest young minds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The immense success of the plan can be seen in its uptake among students. By the end of 2018 the New Colombo Plan will have supported more than 30,000 students from around Australia to undertake experiences in 40 locations across the Indo-Pacific. In just four years, by the end of 2018, the New Colombo Plan will have supported 770 students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        , which is in the heart of my electorate and from where, I'm proud to say, I graduated. Sadly, we didn't have the New Colombo Plan when I was going through. In this time, across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , the plan will have supported more than 2,327 students, giving each of them a unique and highly useful understanding of their host nations, which will no doubt be of use in their professional life but also to us as a nation overall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The New Colombo Plan also boasts significant private sector engagement, with 19 champions and over 240 registered businesses as part of the plan's internship and mentoring network. Again, the substantial private sector interest is testament to the plan's potential over the long term, as our regional neighbours continue to reach new economic milestones.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday, 6 October I was delighted to join the foreign minister as she launched another important aspect of the New Colombo Plan, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        alumni program. At the launch we heard from two incredibly inspirational young students who have participated in the plan: Charlie Hamra from the University of Adelaide and Michelle Howie from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         University of South Australia
        </a>
        . Michelle studied engineering and Korean at

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAIST" rel="nofollow">
         KAIST
        </a>
        , a public research university in Daejon, and she interned at Telstra in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        . Charlie studied Indian politics and culture at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Millia_Islamia" rel="nofollow">
         Jamia Millia Islamia
        </a>
        and interned at the Centre for Escalation of Peace in New Delhi, where he organised a second-track dialogue between India and Bhutan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met Farwaaz Karim from Flinders University. He is Flinders' alumni ambassador and is undertaking bachelor's degrees in law, accounting and economics. In 2015 he undertook a commerce exchange program in Singapore through a New Colombo Plan mobility grant. Since the completion of his exchange he has worked with Spire Research and Consulting, Infrastructure Finance Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankSA" rel="nofollow">
         BankSA
        </a>
        and, most recently, the government of South Australia. It's a very impressive list of experiences, which I'm sure were in part inspired by what he learnt overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mobility grants are an important part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCP" rel="nofollow">
         NCP
        </a>
        —the plan—and Flinders uni has made good use of them. At the alumni launch I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Sebastian Raneskold, Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (International). We heard that Flinders University had sent students to Malaysia and Hong Kong and that 12 nursing and midwifery students will undertake a four-week clinical placement in hospital and community health services in 2018 in Indonesia, our largest and closest neighbour.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I'd like to remark on two factors that stood out for me at the alumni launch. First was the diplomatic value of the New Colombo Plan and what it delivers for Australia. The foreign minister shared with us the genuine goodwill the plan generates with leaders across our region, from presidents to prime ministers to foreign ministers. Second was the energy and enthusiasm our Australian students now have for the country in which they've studied, the culture they've learnt so much about and the new friendships they've formed. This is a truly great program for Australians and our neighbours alike and I can't wait to see us achieve over 30,000 New Colombo Plan graduates by the end of 2018.

          <p>
           Overall I support the New
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
            Colombo Plan
           </a>
           's aims and acknowledge progress in its delivery. I said in my first speech that the Australian people expect us to seek compromise and agreement across parties, and we should acknowledge when something's a good initiative. We shouldn't just bag and throw out things because they're someone else's idea and, of course, we should interrogate to see what's working and how things can be improved. Overall, in my view, the New Colombo Plan is a positive step which builds on Australia's decades-long tradition in public diplomacy in our region. It's too early to meaningfully assess the longer term benefits and outcomes, but we should expect tangible and intangible benefits from people-to-people contact over years and decades. The tangible are trade, economic and academic links, but the intangible, which can be as valuable or more valuable, fundamentally boil down to mutual understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Improvements are possible. I've heard legitimate criticisms of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCP" rel="nofollow">
            NCP
           </a>
           , things like: a persistent criticism that it's too focused on elites—the wealthiest—and we need to address the equity issues; suggestions that there would be merit in extending the program to provide some focus on vocational qualifications; and scepticism from some about the value of the relatively short sojourns, in that this is a very different program from the original Colombo Plan, where study was generally for extended periods. There are concerns that there's a lack of focus on meaningful or substantive language acquisition and that the program's funded in part by cuts to the Australia Awards programs, which bring to Australia the best and brightest minds from Asia. These remain critically important, in my view, and it cannot be either-or.
          </p>
          <p>
           The context is important, however. As always with this government, you've got to have a look at what's not said to really understand. Australia's future is inextricably linked to Asia. Geography is not destiny, but it is reality. We must do much more to deepen our relations with Asia, to seek, in the words of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
            Paul Keating
           </a>
           , 'Security in Asia, not from Asia'. This should be bipartisan and it should be sustained. Shame on you, government, for not having the generosity we're showing to the New Colombo Plan—you digitally burnt the
           <i>
            Australia in the Asian century
           </i>
           white paper. Slogans like 'more Jakarta and less Geneva' are not a substitute for foreign policy.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
            Penny Wong
           </a>
           has made some wonderful, substantial speeches in recent months, laying the foundations for what will be a brilliant tenure as foreign minister. One point she makes powerfully is the need to understand the cultures of Asia and the mindsets of its people—the communitarian approach. Visiting alone, a bit of study and a few friends are not enough. The main window into culture is language, and our dismal record at learning Asian languages is an enormous problem. So, shame on this government for walking away from Labor's efforts to boost Asian language literacy. Those things have to be maintained for decades to have any meaningful impact.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we have heard, the New Colombo Plan is being lauded as a signature initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, central to her legacy—no doubt she's focused on that now! And, while worthy, if this is her signature, the height of her ambitions for Australian diplomacy, then it's pretty sad when compared to the work of some of her predecessors of real calibre. It's not even a new idea, really—it's a resuscitation of an old idea from a Menzies era student exchange program. They are not that interested in picking up Menzies's ideas about homeownership though—being focused on us becoming a nation of landlords and renters.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minister Bishop is a generally competent transactional minister, it's fair to say. She engages, she charms and she reads her DF
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           prepared lines beautifully. She generally responds well to events—putting aside the meltdown on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
            New Zealand
           </a>
           , when she was trying to influence domestic politics with her little tantrum that New Zealand Labour may win government. It was actually a bit sad for those opposite who support her—I know she has some support—to watch her leadership ambitions go up in smoke that week in the House, as the true extent of her glass jaw and her lack of judgement when she goes off script without

           dot points was revealed. I almost wondered whether she was setting us on a path to war, but then she was reined in.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fundamentally, she lacks ambition and big strategic goals for Australia. I was reminded of this last week when we hosted
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Evans" rel="nofollow">
            Gareth Evans
           </a>
           . What a contrast. He has an incredible intellect, strategic nous and achievements that this minister could only dream of: the chemical weapons treaty, where the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>
           called him and asked for help; the Cambodia-Paris peace accords—Bishop kowtowed last week to Cambodia; progress on denuclearisation; the Canberra commission; creation of the regional architecture that we live off today with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
            APEC

           and the

           </a>
           , laying the foundations for his later work on peace building and the responsibility to protect doctrine; the anti-apartheid movement; and the Antarctic commission. In this context, 'modest' is really an overstatement for the New Colombo Plan, compared to Gareth's achievements. Then again, it's a lot more than can be said for their previous foreign minister, that sad sack Downer. His only achievement that anyone can think of is lasting longer than Gareth. While we welcome the New Colombo Plan, it is not a substitute for substantive policy.

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
             Colombo Plan
            </a>
            . It is a signature policy in the coalition's foreign policy platform. As a middle power, Australia naturally invests significant thought and effort regarding its role and its place in this world. How we interact with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and further abroad, has a significant impact on our own future and on the future of the planet. If we want to interact meaningfully, if we want to trade more, build ties, achieve international goals, foster relationships and, indeed, build friendships, we need Australians to be as literate as possible when it comes to the cultures, the languages, the practices and the business practices of our neighbours.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New Colombo Plan continues to be a crucial element of this government's long-term plans to build closer relations for Australia in our region, including at the grassroots level. By building these networks and strengthening Australia's connections in our region, economic growth, prosperity and stability may continue to grow, hopefully for many years to come. In its first five years, the New Colombo Plan will have supported more than 30,000 young Australians—undergraduates from 40 Australian universities—to undertake study and work based placements in 35 different locations across our region. We are on track to meet that 30,000 target. Not only is this expanding the horizons of some of our best and brightest future leaders, it's creating more opportunities and links for Australians at large.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had the huge privilege earlier this year to meet some of the New Colombo Plan recipients from around my electorate of Brisbane. I met with them both in Brisbane and here in Canberra, when some of them visited. Their placements stretch right across the Asia-Pacific region. What struck me most was their eagerness to learn about the countries they were travelling to, and their hope to be fully immersed into the languages and the cultures they would experience. They did really recognise that huge and rare opportunity before them. I was really confident that they would make both Brisbane and Australia very, very proud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thousands of Australian undergraduates are returning to Australia now with new skills and networks from their experiences across the region. They enhance Australia's capacity to engage with our neighbours into the future. I was really taken earlier—I think it was earlier this year when the Singaporean Prime Minister visited—by that story of how the Singaporean Prime Minister's wife had previously spent a significant amount of time in Australia under a similar program many decades ago, and how that had fostered that great relationship we now have with Singapore. In particular, I want to give a shout-out to some

            students, like Alexandra Tran, who have become New Colombo Plan alumni ambassadors after their very successful stints overseas. Alexandra did a three-month internship with

            and now she studies with the New Colombo Plan scholarship in Korea.
           </p>
           <p>
            New Colombo Plan recipients have been working on a range of projects, from entrepreneurship in Fiji, to humanitarian engineering and work in India, to Mandarin language immersion in China, to industrial design projects to support people with disabilities in Singapore. That's a great and broad array of backgrounds. Equally, this program supports students from Australia with a broad array of backgrounds. We're talking of Indigenous students, students with disabilities, students from regional and remote areas, students who began their life in a refugee camp, students who are the first in their families ever to attend university, as I was, or indeed the first in their family even to have a passport and travel overseas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over 60 per cent of New Colombo Plan mobility grant recipients are female; 15 per cent were born overseas; and over 20 per cent speak a language at home other than English. A full 10 per cent have never travelled overseas before. Around 240 private sector organisations have signed up to support the program, offering those internships and mentorships to these scholars. Nineteen Australian business leaders have joined the New Colombo Plan as business champions. They'll be promoting the program across their networks to emphasise the real value of this. Many of the businesses involved are providing transformational opportunities for all of these new Australian future leaders so that they gain real-life experience in the workplace.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the New Colombo Plan is going from strength to strength. It has broad support from right across the parliament, the university sector, business, the broader community and, importantly, our region. I commend it.

            <p>
             I have spoken frequently in this chamber in the past about the need for Australia to tackle with a sense of urgency the task of engaging with our region. As shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen recently noted, Australia needs a step change across government, business and culture in its engagement with Asia. There's a middle class of 1.7 billion people in our region, bigger than all of Europe and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">
              North America
             </a>
             combined, but less than 10 per cent of Australian businesses currently do business in Asia. Our northern neighbour Indonesia is predicted to become the fourth-largest economy in the world, but it's not even in Australia's top 10 trading partners. Indeed, we invest more in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             , a country of just four million people, than we do in Indonesia, a country of more than 260 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality is that Australia's Asia capability in our governments, businesses, education, and cultural institutions is very low. We have a big task ahead of ourselves if we want to engage effectively with Asia in the future. Programs like the New
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
              Colombo Plan
             </a>
             , which supports students who choose to study in a non-Australian city in our region, are a good start. It is particularly pleasing that Indonesia is the most popular destination for undergraduates under the New Colombo Plan. But we shouldn't get too carried away with its success. When looking at the backgrounds of New Colombo Plan participants, there's a real question about whether Australian kids from all backgrounds are getting an equal opportunity to participate in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, the scale and impact of the program can be easily overestimated. Thirty thousand Australian undergrad students will spend some time abroad under the plan by the end of 2018—all to the good. But the Erasmus program in Europe, designed to promote cross-cultural engagement between students in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
              EU
             </a>
             , saw over 200,000 students travel to a different city in the European Union in 2013-14 alone. By 2020, more than four million European students will have participated in the program. For the equivalent level of engagement with Asia under the New Colombo Plan, adjusted to Australia's student population, we would need to be sending at least 50 per cent more Australians into the region every year. So it's a good start but, taken alone, the program doesn't reflect the urgency of the need to engage and improve our Asia capability.
            </p>
            <p>
             To truly build engagement and scale in a way that all Australians are able to participate in, we need to be looking for opportunities across all facets of our society. Building Asia capability through high school engagement and youth leadership exchanges are also important in this regard. I recently had the opportunity to see a great example of this in action when I hosted the shadow Treasurer and delegates from the Conference of Australian and Indonesian Youth at a session with students studying

The Williamstown High School Bahasa Indonesia program is led by dedicated teachers Matthew Grose and Sharon Croft and includes a sister-school partnership with Labschool in Jakarta. Students have been travelling backwards and forwards between Willi High and Labschool for a number of years now. Willi High students recently returned from a trip to Indonesia to homestay with Labschool students' families. Unfortunately, the kids at Willi High are swimming against the tide. Depressingly, more Australians were studying Bahasa Indonesia when

             INDY, a bilateral youth organisation which provides a platform for young leaders from both countries to create a stronger bilateral relationship, came with me and the shadow Treasurer to Willi High to support the teachers and students in their endeavours. CAUSINDY holds an annual four-day program which brings together 30 young leaders from Australia and Indonesia. I am pleased to say that this year, 2017, it was hosted in Melbourne and supported by the Victorian state government. I was pleased to host delegates in Footscray for a Vietnamese meal as part of the CAUSINDY program this year to show off Australia's multicultural background. I reckon CAUSINDY is pretty great for building personal relationships between Australians and Indonesians. As a former delegate myself, I've seen its work firsthand. I was pleased to be able to give the shadow Treasurer an insight into it as well. I know that the shadow Treasurer is in particular looking forward to receiving his jersey from Melbourne's very own Indonesian expat

            </p>
            <p>
             We need to create more opportunities for schools like Willi High to build partnerships with Asian schools, to offer these opportunities to Australian high school students. That's why as part of Labor's future Asia policy Labor is committed to restoring funding to the

             , an initiative of the Keating Labor government that was established to promote Asian studies in Australian schools. The Asia Education Foundation currently offers a BRIDGE School Partnerships Program to promote partnerships like the one between Willi high and Labschool in Jakarta. The New Colombo Plan is worthwhile, as far as it goes. But we need to do a whole lot more to get Australia's Asia capability up to where it needs to be in the new world in which we live.

              in Burwood. These are two fantastic tertiary institutions where thousands of Chisholm residents are pursuing further education. I'm thrilled also that both Monash and Deakin are participant universities in our government's New Colombo Plan.
             </p>
             <p>
              The New Colombo Plan continues to be a crucial element of the government's long-term plans to build closer relations in our region. In its first five years, the New Colombo Plan has supported more than 30,000 Australian undergraduates undertaking study and work based placements across the Indo-Pacific region, including some 22 scholarship recipients and 2,151 mobility grant recipients studying in my electorate of Chisholm. These undergraduates are returning to Australia with new skills and networks from their experiences in the region, enhancing Australia's capacity to engage with our neighbours and, of course, having gained wonderful insight into the cultures and professional settings of our regional neighbours.

             <p>
              The New Colombo Plan is mobilising young Australians who are bright, inquisitive and wonderful ambassadors for our nation. Indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently launched the New Colombo Plan Alumni Ambassador Program, which, in its first year, will support students from across Australia to promote the New Colombo Plan and the value of Indo-Pacific study and work placements. Some young people from Chisholm's Monash and Deakin universities are included in this cohort of ambassadors and are representative of the diversity of students participating in the New Colombo Plan and of the depth and breadth of study and internship opportunities available in the Indo-Pacific. Included among these students is William Rathgeber from Deakin University, who this year is completing his

              The New Colombo Plan thrives not only from government funding but from private sector sponsorship, including new sponsorship this year from aged care provider Arcare. Arcare's funding of $500,000 over five years will be directed to support New Colombo Plan mobility programs. Next year, it will fund 14 Deakin University School of Nursing and Midwifery students to travel to Bhutan to undertake practicums in primary health care, midwifery and aged care study. It is just one example of the fantastic mobility programs being undertaken by Chisholm students. The plan's mobility program would not have been possible without this additional support, and it is a great example of how the Turnbull government is partnering with the private sector to deliver new opportunities for young Australians. The New Colombo Plan is a wonderful initiative that is enhancing relationships in our region. I encourage all undergraduate students to apply to participate and explore the wonderful opportunities available in our region.

               Two-thirds of the world's middle class will be living in Asia within the next 20 years. This, of course, presents enormous opportunities for Australia, but one of the greatest opportunities and challenges for us is to build closer and more mutually beneficial relationships within our neighbourhoods of the Indo-Pacific region. Now, that's easier said than done. Difficulties in this area include language barriers as well as cultural and, of course, geographic obstacles that hinder progress in developing greater ties within the region. But, as the world's economic, political and strategic focus continues to shift towards Asia, it's clear that opportunities of engagement far outweigh the problems that thwart greater connectivity and regional cooperation.

               As a former parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, I've got a great passion for improving relations with the Asian region, particularly in developing a greater Asian understanding through both cultural and linguistic awareness in Australian society. Unfortunately, at the moment, we're going backwards when it comes to learning languages of Asian background in Australia. The number of students studying Mandarin at the

               level in

               has actually fallen over recent decades. In 2015, there were only 61 non-background students studying Mandarin in year 12—a fall of 76 per cent since 1997. More students studied Indonesian in school in 1974 than do today in modern-day Australia. When it comes to Asian languages in schools, globally across Australia the rate of penetration was 24 per cent in 2000 and it has fallen to 18.6 per cent in modern-day Australia. Quite simply, we're going backwards when it comes to teaching Asian languages in our schools.

               Building relationships is going to be a very important part of Asian cultural understanding. It is often the key to successful dealings at government and business levels. Gaining greater understanding of Asian languages and cultures and how to build relationships can be of great benefit to Australian businesses seeking to expand in Asia. The New

               Labor are committed to strengthening Australia's place within the Indo-Pacific region. We remain committed to ensuring that we increase connectivity. We are concerned about this government's approach to building Asian language literacy in this country. There have been two goes at national plans to build Asian language literacy—one by the Keating government and the other by the Rudd government—and both were cancelled by Liberal governments when they came to power. In the era when
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson" rel="nofollow">

               , the Howard government cancelled the program. Then the Abbott government cancelled the government program that was put in place by the Rudd government. They cancelled the

               white paper, which was a road map to deeper engagement with Asia. So, although the New Colombo Plan has been good at building relations with Asia, there is much more that we can do at a government level, including having a nationally consistent approach to ensuring that we're improving exposure to languages at both school and tertiary levels in Australia.
