       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to upgrade the high-voltage power supply at the Puckapunyal military Area in Puckapunyal in Victoria. The Puckapunyal Military Area has been an army base and training facility since World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . It has undergone various changes to meet the rigours of training and specialised skills of the Australia Defence Force and is in desperate need of an upgrade. An upgrade is vital for the sustainability of current and emerging Australia Defence Force capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, the external high-voltage power supply network is predicted to operate beyond its current design capacity. The upgrade will minimise power failures and the impact on the Army's power-dependent training modules that are tightly aligned with scheduled activities. The proposed works include underground cabling, reconfiguration and extensions of existing electrical networks throughout the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , replacing pillars inside their substations, and a new precast concrete and steel building to allow for the required upgrades to comply with electrical standards and enable ease of works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will improve the reliability of external high-voltage power supply to Puckapunyal Military Area, provide redundancy in external high-voltage power supply to the Puckapunyal Military Area and upgrade the internal high-voltage power reticulation within the area. The government approved budget for the area power supply upgrade is $32.7 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . This includes management and design fees, construction, equipment, contingencies and allowance for escalation. The project will provide opportunities for jobs and growth throughout the construction period. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in late 2016 and be completed by late 2017. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to undertake a fit-out of a leased premises to establish a new

        </a>
        in Doha, Qatar. On 20 May 2015, the government announced that it would open a new embassy in Doha. Doha is a key growth area in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the establishment of an embassy will facilitate Australia’s commercial links with Qatar.
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of an embassy builds on the increased presence of Australian nationals and businesses in Qatar at a time of major infrastructure development in the country, including in preparation for the 2022

        World Cup. The project is valued at an estimated $7 million and includes all costs associated with the fit-out, such as builders’ costs, consultant fees, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and escalation allowance. The proposed works will also provide efficient, modern and functional accommodation that meets the needs of the diplomatic representation in the country. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the fit-out is expected to commence in mid-2016 and with best endeavours be completed by late 2016. I am confident the committee will undertake a timely inquiry into these works and I look forward to its report. I commend the motion to the House.
