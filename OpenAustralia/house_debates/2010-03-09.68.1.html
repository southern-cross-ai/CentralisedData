        We are very fortunate here to have exceptional people in our communities, people who genuinely make a difference, and it is only right that we acknowledge their contribution. On Monday afternoon I had the pleasure of attending the

        ’s 2010 Women of the West Award ceremony, held at the Parramatta campus, where Sister Kerry MacDermott of Minto was proudly named the joint winner, along with Aunty Mae Robinson of

        . Michelle Fenech of Camden was awarded the

         UWS
        </a>
        Young Women of the West Award. This prestigious award, now in its sixth year, continues to grow and succeeds in showcasing the diversity and strength of women in Western Sydney. I would like to take a bit of time now to inform the House briefly about each of these worthy winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great honour for me to nominate Sister Kerry, a Minto resident for 26 years. Her award was a fitting tribute to the hard work and dedication she has shown to the local community for nearly three decades. Sister Kerry is a member of the religious community
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady
        </a>
        ’s Nurses for the Poor, better known as the ‘Brown Sisters’, and currently oversees the Catholic Diocese of Wollongong’s Aboriginal ministry. Monday was also Sister Kerry’s 46th anniversary in the convent. What strikes me most about Sister Kerry is her ceaseless devotion to the principles of social justice and equality, particularly in relation to the local Aboriginal community in south-west Sydney. Over the years, Sister Kerry has become a well-respected and much-loved figure within the Campbelltown community. Her compassion, empathy and capacity to advocate for those who feel they have no voice know no bounds. Sister Kerry has truly lived a life of service, and yet she does not expect credit for her tireless work within this community, nor does she accept credit willingly.

        Aunty Mae Robinson is a longtime Mount Pritchard resident and Aboriginal elder who was recognised for her contribution to the education and wellbeing of Indigenous people. Aunty Mae has an impressive list of achievements and involvement with various programs and initiatives that all help to improve the lives and education of Aboriginal youth in south-west Sydney. In 2007, Aunty Mae was recognised by the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council with an Indigenous Elders and Leaders Award. In 2009, Aunty Mae was awarded the Director-General’s Award for Excellent Service to

        </a>
        and Training. Even though Aunty Mae is now officially retired, she continues to support schools in the region to develop a greater understanding of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and to support Aboriginal student achievement. She remains a member of the New South Wales Aboriginal Education Consultative Group and is their representative on the UWS Indigenous Advisory Council.
       </p>

        Michelle Fenech was awarded the UWS Young Women of the West Award for her commitment to community and charity work. Michelle began working as the sole journalist at the
        <i>
         Wollondilly Advertiser
        </i>
        in 2006 and she quickly became more than just a reporter: she became an advocate and strong lobbyist for her local community. Unfortunately, one of Michelle’s close friends suffers from cystic fibrosis, a debilitating and life-threatening illness that affects about 3,000 Australians. Michelle took her compassion, generosity and sheer determination and organised some of

        </a>
        ’s most successful fundraisers, including the 65-kilometre Swim for Cystic Fibrosis. This event has been held for the past two years and Michelle has raised, in Picton alone, nearly $100,000. Michelle also regularly uses her weekly column to campaign for those in our community who are in need, and particularly for those who often do not have a voice, calling for compassion and generosity—two qualities Michelle has in spades.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the Highly Commended awards that were presented to Prue Gregory of Campbelltown and Tarsha Gavin of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnyrigg_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Bonnyrigg Heights
        </a>
        . Prue is the Principal Solicitor for Macarthur Legal Centre. She regularly undertakes pro bono work in the local area, particularly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        and Claymore, and works tirelessly on improving access to justice for socially and economically disadvantaged people. Tarsha is a student at Sydney university. She commits herself to advocating for young people’s rights and interests and has been involved in a number of voluntary positions in government organisations, non-government organisations and charity groups at local, state and federal levels. Our community is indebted to people like those I have just mentioned. Their spirit and commitment have touched the lives of so many people and make our community what it is today.
