        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry, representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister outline to the House why the largest military build-up in our peacetime history is vital to defeating our enemies abroad so that we can be safe at home?

         I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. As members are aware, there were two heinous attacks in Baghdad overnight, and we express our deepest sympathies with the people of Iraq and with the family of an Australian girl, Zynab Al Harbiya—who was mentioned before in question time—who was killed in one of the attacks.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS" rel="nofollow">
          IS
         </a>
         has claimed responsibility for the attack. We condemn these attacks in the strongest terms and reaffirm our commitment to defeating IS in Iraq and to preventing its spread throughout the world. Defeating IS abroad will ensure the safety of Australians at home. That is one of the reasons for the government's commitment to our largest military build-up in our peacetime history. The Turnbull government will ensure, including through our record $200 billion investment in defence capability, that our ADF can continue to apply the lethal force required to defeat terrorists abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia continues to make one of the largest contributions to the campaign in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Up to 760 ADF members are currently deployed, including 300 members in Task Group Taji, training Iraqi army troops; 120 members of the Special Operations Task Group, providing advice and assistance to the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service; 300 members of the Air Task Group, conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria; and 55 members embedded in coalition positions in Iraq.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_October" rel="nofollow">
          Since October
         </a>
         2014, there have been more than 2,300 ADF airstrike sorties over Iraq, delivering 1,900 weapons into Iraq and Syria. Let us not forget that it was this Prime Minister who altered our approach to targeting enemy combatants in Syria and Iraq so that our forces are empowered to act against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">
          ISIS
         </a>
         in Iraq and Syria—no matter where they are or what they are doing, so long as they belong to the group of terrorists that we seek to eliminate.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also in Australia's national interest to ensure Afghanistan never again becomes a haven for terrorists. In response to a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
          NATO
         </a>
         request, the Australian government has agreed to increase the Australian Defence Force's mission to Afghanistan by 30 personnel, from around 270 to around 300. These additional personnel will further develop the long-term capabilities of the Afghan security forces as part of our current train, advise and assist mission. They will not be in combat roles. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         remains in discussion with NATO officials regarding the task allocation for these additional forces which will be confirmed in coming weeks. An increased Australian contribution to the Resolute Support Mission is part of Australia being not just a supporter of the war on terror but also capable of taking part in it in an effective and meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for defence for their continued bipartisan approach to these matters in support of our ADF serving overseas.
