       <p>
        Today I would like to pay tribute to Norman Alexander Bilton who died on 24 June this year, aged 97. I am making this statement in the House today as politics and parliament were so important to him. Norm was a true friend, a Labor Party stalwart and a life member who had been a member of the party for 65 years. His sons talked about his commitment to the ideals and values of the Labor Party and his undying commitment to social justice and a fair go for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm was a real gentleman. He was quietly spoken and was an articulate man whose opinion was always valued, and he invariable won an argument without people recognising that he was doing so. Politics was not Norm's only love—he adored his wife, Ina, their children, Norm and Robert, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In addition he loved the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm was a vibrant 97-year-old until he became ill. He had a driver licence until December last year. He was a progressive man, both in his politics and in his social values. He was a strong advocate for voluntary euthanasia and regularly attended meetings. Unfortunately, when Norm became seriously ill he did not have access to this and lived a painful and debilitating existence for the last six months of his life. Norm was one of my heroes—a great Australian who fought for our country and made a lifetime commitment to Australia.
