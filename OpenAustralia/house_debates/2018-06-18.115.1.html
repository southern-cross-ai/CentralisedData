       <p>
        It is poignant that I stand to give a speech on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill of 2018. Before I address the six different schedules to the bill in more granular detail, there are a couple of points I want to make. Firstly, I used to make the mistake of thinking that veterans are elderly men or women who are proudly paraded through the streets of this nation's capital and provincial cities in Jeeps on Anzac Day. But I am now becoming more and more familiar with veterans under the age of 30 who have returned from conflict, for whom, of course, these provisions are also made.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing I'd like to just quickly address is some of the amazing work that's being done by some of my innovative
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        groups throughout the electorate of Wright. There is no more poignant an example than that of Errol Guilfoyle, President of the Beaudesert RSL, and his advocacy team, who are discovering new ways to stretch the counselling services of the RSL more widely to communities throughout the electorate. The RSL have shown entrepreneurial flair. They've actually put together a caravan, which they take on the road, that they use for fundraisers and as an outreach office, which works in conjunction and over the top of the six schedules that I will speak to in more granular detail. Steve Monteath is the vice-president, and was at the helm of the design and construction of the caravan, which is pulled around the region and has been on display. David Kassulke from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ" rel="nofollow">
         AJ
        </a>
        Bush was the manufacturer. David does an enormous amount of work for the community. He's a member of the chamber of commerce in our community, and he had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_King" rel="nofollow">
         Mark King
        </a>
        from his workforce take point on construction. I can assure you that, if there are any other RSL organisations around the country looking to replicate this amazing work so that outreach can be undertaken, AJ Bush in Beaudesert would happily roll out another 100 or 200 of these caravans to be used for exactly the same purpose—supporting our veterans community. Tony Paddock did an amazing job in branding it in the RSL colours, and Dr Robbie Maher contributed to it. The federal government kicked in $21,000 for that initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government continues to honour its strong commitment to veterans and the veterans community by extending a range of services to veterans and their families—to give them the support that they not only need but deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill contains six schedules, all important schedules which support our veterans and their existing families. Schedule 1 is all about the removal of barriers to the rehabilitation of veterans who suffer as a result of service related physical and mental health conditions. These measures will provide former members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        with incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earnings when they are studying, as opposed to the current rate, which is 75 per cent. I don't think anyone would begrudge someone that, when they were either learning or earning, trying to rehabilitate and re-enter the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 2 is all about preventing veteran suicide and improving the mental health services available for veterans. For veterans who have been discharged from hospital following an attempted suicide or suicide crisis, or who may be at risk of suicide because of mental health issues, this measure will provide services to support veterans' mental health, including access to government and non-government treatment, and services that will help reduce the risk of suicide and enhance their quality of life. The mental health integrity that we as a government are focused on is a sleeping giant in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 3 supports veterans' families by giving partners more time to choose whether to receive compensation payments resulting from their partner's death as a weekly payment, a lump sum or a mixture of both. It's all about flexibility for families in a difficult time, empowering them to decide how they'd like to receive their compensation, if, regretfully, that ever happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 4 is another measure which supports veterans' families, by extending eligibility for the Long Tan Bursary scheme to the grandchildren of any Australian Vietnam veteran. This enables grandchildren of veterans to access the bursary to undertake post-secondary education, and it is an important recognition of the contribution that Vietnam veterans have made to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 5 rightly recognises serving on special submarine operations between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992 as operational service. This will ensure the classified nature of special operations does not hinder access by those veterans to benefit entitlements available to those with operational service. That has always been a contentious point, and I'm glad to see that was introduced as a schedule to give relief to those submarine men and women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 6—too often veterans struggle to wade through the masses of paperwork to make claims for compensation. Presently, the claim must be made in writing, distinct from a claim of liability. This measure will enable veterans seeking compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 to lodge a claim for compensation orally. The amendments will mean a veteran will be asked during a needs-assessment telephone call whether they want to make a claim for compensation, and their oral statement will be treated as a valid claim under the act, making it easier for veterans to engage with the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        This compensation bill demonstrates that the government has listened to the concerns and frustrations of veterans and their families. We are committed to putting them first and at the centre of the decisions we make, not only as a government but from both sides of the House. Veterans have given so much to this country. They have fought and served to protect our great nation, our freedoms and our way of life. That's why this government is strongly supporting veterans not only in my electorate of Wright but right across the entire nation, extending real support to veterans and their families, giving them the services that they need and deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to close my commentary by again offering an accolade to the RSL in Beaudesert, where we have an advocacy officer, Tom—I won't share his last name—who's 25 and a returned serviceman himself. In communications with him recently, I asked him what his initial challenges were. He said that returned veterans of his age group that are returning from active service in operational theatres around the world find that there's a disconnect between the younger generation and the RSLs, who, for all intents and purposes, are perceived as a more ageing population. They find it hard to connect. Tom is doing an amazing job, building those personal relationships, because he has just come back from modern warfare. He understands the equipment that they're using. He has been trained and has just returned from an environment where he may know some of the chains of command, some of the personalities. The entrepreneurial trailer which allows the RSL to have even wider outreach for advocacy is a vehicle that will assist Tom in reaching those modern veterans who don't believe the RSL is a place that they can land.

        assure all Australians that this government and those on the other side of the House put our hands on our hearts, and we do try to provide an environment so that no-one is left behind. I commend this bill to the House.

        </small>
        <p>
         I welcome a veteran-centric approach. It makes sense, of course: you focus on veterans when you're trying to help them. The more the focus is on veterans and their families and their needs, the better. Our shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, has already given a comprehensive statement of Labor's position in relation to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 and our support for its provisions. For the record, I happen to think the member for Kingston is doing an outstanding job, advocating for veterans and their families, and I commend her for it. Recently, she came to Darwin and attended a forum which I convened for the veterans in my electorate. She heard their concerns and answered their questions. Solomon has well over 2,000 veterans. One of my most important objectives as the member for Solomon is to ensure that the people who have served our country receive the support and assistance they need, particularly as they transition into civilian life and build their lives after service.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill contains six schedules. They are all important, and we support them, but I wish to speak particularly today about the first two, which relate to education and employment, and to suicide prevention. Education and employment are crucial for veterans transitioning into civilian life, particularly for those who have had to leave the ADF because of injury or incapacity. Unemployment is a critical issue for veterans that are leaving the service. It can lead to financial hardship, depression, mental illness, family breakdown and homelessness. We know that about 30 per cent of those leaving the ADF fail to find a job. For those who do, it is often below their capabilities and at a pay level significantly below what they were earning in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         . But of course it's not just about the money, as important as that is; it's about purpose, about having meaningful employment—a worthwhile job that also provides a routine and structure to life. The social connections that come with employment can go some way towards replacing those previously provided by military life.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that Labor has committed to a $121 million veterans' employment program, which will assist veterans to move into meaningful employment and assist employers to hire prospective workers with highly transferable skills. Talking to my dad, a Vietnam veteran, and his mates, I think the best thing that can be done, if possible, is to come out of the military into employment. The transition from military life to education can also be challenging. In this regard, I commend the work of the Australian Student Veterans Association, ASVA, which helps veterans overcome these challenges by establishing chapters in universities throughout Australia to provide a peer network for veterans on campuses. These chapters can link veterans with like-minded students who have also served, to give veterans some sense of that camaraderie in the ADF and so they can assist each other, because that transition process can be pretty tough. I want to acknowledge in particular someone who's had to transfer out of the forces due to injury—that is, Matty Wyatt-Smith, the national manager of strategic engagement with ASVA. I also acknowledge our own Hannah Taino-Spick, from Palmerston, who is doing wonderful work with ASVA in my electorate, in particular with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin_University" rel="nofollow">
          Charles Darwin University
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Schedule 2 creates a new suicide prevention pilot. This trial program will build on the coordinated approach used in the two previous trials, providing intensive services to ensure veterans receive support when they leave hospital with access to relevant government and non-government treatment and services. I want to in particular recognise the great work of the member for Herbert, Cathy O'Toole, in her advocacy for establishing the first suicide prevention trial in Townsville. The second trial created the coordinated veterans' care pilot, aimed at providing mental health support for veterans in rural and regional areas. There is a great and real need for a similar service to be based in my electorate in Darwin. I urge the minister and the department to consider establishing a specialised mental health and suicide prevention unit to service our more than 2,000 veterans in Darwin, Palmerston and the surrounding rural areas in partnership, of course, with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government. As an ex-service person, I have known many men and women directly affected by the tragedy of suicide. I hope the reforms in this bill will go a long way to avert such personal tragedies into the future. I fully support this trial and the others currently underway. I look forward to seeing the results that come out of them. I sincerely hope for the trial's success.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to quickly touch on an issue that has affected many veterans—mefloquine. It is a current issue that has been raised with me a number of times by veterans and it goes to the ex-service personnel involved in anti-malarial trials using the mefloquine family of drugs. I again acknowledge the work of the member for Herbert, Cathy O'Toole; she's a great advocate for the veterans in Townsville and in her electorate. Dr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
          Mike Kelly
         </a>
         , the member for Eden-Monaro and a former Army officer, has also spoken about the effects that these experimental drug programs, these trials, had. He has also joined the calls for an urgent inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of these trials took place as part of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERFET" rel="nofollow">
          INTERFET
         </a>
         , which went into Timor-Leste almost 20 years ago now, but the trials also involved ADF personnel deployed to Bougainville. The then Minister for Veterans' Affairs—and we've had quite a few, but at that time it was Mr Tehan—told these veterans he would set up a dedicated mefloquine support team to assist with mefloquine-related claims. Unfortunately, he didn't do that, and we found out through Senate estimates that there is no dedicated team and that a few
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
          DVA
         </a>
         staff deal with mefloquine inquiries along with their other duties.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge that the shadow minister has led the way and has joined with the new minister, who is with us here in the chamber, who now has the opportunity to right this wrong, to do the right thing and to set up a full inquiry into the mefloquine anti-malarial trials and some of the disability claims resulting from them. The minister, I know, understands that it's his duty to address this issue and to do the right things by the veterans and their families who may have been harmed during these trials.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to now move to the concept of a one-stop shop. To go back in history a little bit: since the end of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         , we have, as a nation, recognised that we have a responsibility to care for our returned service personnel. Arguably our greatest military commander,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Monash" rel="nofollow">
          John Monash
         </a>
         , saw it as his duty to ensure that we commemorated the sacrifices of those who died in the service of our country and to support those who returned. In the past 100 years, this sense of national obligation has led to a complex system of government and non-government organisations intended to support veterans and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill presently before us is an example of our efforts to meet the changing needs of veterans and their families, and in recent years there has been a growing and welcome awareness of the problems and challenges faced by our serving personnel as they return from overseas armed conflicts and as they leave active service. This awareness has been mainly focused on health and wellbeing, with particular concern about what we now understand to be post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression and suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
         But one consequence of the proliferation of organisations and services intended to aid veterans is that, in the words of the National Mental Health Commission Review 2017, it may be 'leading to results that are not necessarily in the interests of former service members'. My friend Colonel Andrew Hocking
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
          CSC
         </a>
         , in a private capacity has put forward some very thoughtful suggestions about how we can simplify and improve the process of provision of services to veterans. He writes that there are now:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … an estimated 2,780 ex-service organization locations now established across Australia and a further 3,474 charities with veterans nominated as their beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the growth in veteran support has generally been positive, with more choice of service providers, greater geographical access and more responsive support, there is now a need to serve cross-sector veteran and family needs, and a need to review the effective functioning of the whole system. He says that it would be counterproductive to invest more in individual organisations and programs without investment in the functioning of the overall system.
        </p>
        <p>
         He has made a suggestion which I strongly support: the establishment of one-stop shops for veterans and their families. He points out that, at present, veterans and their families are largely left to fulfil the function of cross-sector coordination themselves. He writes:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Prior to attempting any self-coordination, veterans struggle to understand what cross-sector services are available to them. Veterans are expected to conduct their own research, develop a degree of knowledge and expertise of the services available, and then individually apply to each service provider. This is stressful and in some circumstances overwhelming. For this reason, there is a compelling argument that the veteran support system should be optimised for the ease of interaction by veterans and their families.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The one-stop shops would aim to develop networks and a thorough expertise of community, state, federal and cross sector services available in a particular region, and then to develop mechanisms that assist veterans and their families to coordinate their access to these services. Whilst the human nature of supporting veterans and their families warrants the establishment of physical one-stop shops, the development of virtual tools is likely to be of benefit.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Consideration could be given to reviewing the extant facilities and resources resident in individual organisations (including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         , DVA,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
          ESO
         </a>
         s but also other federal/state/community social service hubs), with the aim of collaboratively pooling these facilities and resources to achieve the functions described above. A one-stop shop would not only ease the burden on veterans and their families but allow for effective evaluation of the services available. This further serves a dual purpose of highlighting duplication of services and reducing costs and overheads for individual organisations, resulting in a more efficient and effective use of available whole of nation resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commend Colonel Hocking's suggestions to the minister and the future minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, I would like to confirm Labor's support for the measures contained in this bill. I commend the government for bringing them forward in legislative form. However, as the minister is well aware, there's more to be done. The Mefloquine issue is an instance where the government has failed our veterans and their families. The whole system of services and support for veterans, whilst well-meaning, is fragmented, complex and confusing. In my electorate we need a one-stop shop where veterans and their families can go to seek guidance, advice and practical help. That's what I'm committed to. I'm committed to supporting those who have served our country and have served our community.

          It's a pleasure to follow the member for Solomon in this debate. I'm very pleased to stand to contribute to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018. This bill comprises a number of important measures that will provide greater support and assistance to veterans and the people they love. Labor supports this legislation. I want to make that very clear at the outset. We know that the men and women who have given so much to protect our country deserve every opportunity to build healthy, productive lives after they leave the defence services. Veterans have sacrificed so much already for all of us, and as a country we absolutely have an obligation to provide the support and assistance necessary when they return to civilian life.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a personal issue for me. I'm very happy to declare that interest up-front. I'm the daughter of a Vietnam veteran. I have lived through all of those cycles: a life of service, a life of adjusting into civilian life and a life around families readjusting and learning to adapt to the changes, obstacles and difficulties that many veterans face when they return from active service and, indeed, over very many decades of life in the community. From a family point of view, dealing with issues around post-traumatic stress, for example, is a huge issue, not simply for the veteran but for all of the family and members around that veteran to ensure that the readjustment to civilian and family life is the best it possibly can be.
         </p>
         <p>
          But I not only have a strong personal interest in ensuring that veterans are given the best support and assistance available; my electorate of Newcastle, of course, has a very rich history in active military matters and active service and has a very vibrant veteran community. Indeed, there are many examples of Newcastle leading the way in terms of some of the support services, particularly for those Vietnam veterans. I recall as a very young person that my father and many men of his generation returned from Vietnam and started what was then known as the Vietnam Legions in Newcastle. To my knowledge, that was the very first organised Vietnam veterans' association in Australia, and I really wanted to pay tribute to that group of men and their partners who had the vision, the foresight, to ensure that there were in those days very informal supports—not driven by government at all—that were assured to those men and women who'd seen active service. I pay tribute to what was the Vietnam Legions and is now the Newcastle Hunter Region Vietnam Veterans. Today it is headed up by Geoff Linwood.

          There is no doubt, as I said earlier in this speech, that the transition from military to civilian existence can be very jarring. It can be a very destabilising and, indeed, distressing transition for some people. It was identified in the recently released

          … one of the most significant and stressful transitions in the life course of military members world-wide owing to potential changes in identity, community and residence, social networks and status, family roles, occupation, finances, routines, responsibilities, supports and culture.
         </p>
         <p>
          This report is the result of one of three studies being undertaken through the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program—the most comprehensive study examining the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving ADF members and their families. I know this study quite well, and I've participated as a family member in many of these longitudinal studies over the course of my life. So I'm very acutely attuned to the need to pay close attention to the findings of these studies, and I'm very pleased to see that that work is now informing the legislation before this House.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first schedule of the bill before us today makes it easier for some veterans to get the skills they need to move into the civilian workforce. That's a great thing. It's hard to overstate the importance of finding meaningful employment post service, not just for financial reasons but also for structure, self-esteem and a sense of inclusion. Finding a job can be one of the most challenging things veterans do after they leave the defence forces. The unemployment rate for veterans sits at a little over 30 per cent, which is five times higher than the national average. For those who didn't discharge medically, there's an estimated 11.2 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national average. Underemployment is also a huge problem with veterans. Almost one in five ex-serving personnel is thought to be underemployed, working in jobs beneath their capacities and with an average of a 30 per cent drop in wages. We need to give ex-service men and women the absolute best chance of building healthy, happy lives, where they're able to contribute fully to their communities and gain secure, meaningful employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Schedule 1 of this bill will, as I said, assist returning service men and women who are on incapacity payments and are undertaking further studies as part of their rehabilitation plan. Under this measure, the incapacity payment, which is paid as compensation for loss of earnings as a result of service related conditions, is maintained at 100 per cent of the normal weekly earnings while veterans are doing approved full-time study. At the moment, these payments drop to 75 per cent after 45 weeks, but this provision will maintain full payments. I understand that when this bill is passed, the 100 per cent payment will also be available to veterans currently on full-time study as part of their rehabilitation plan.
         </p>
         <p>
          Education and reskilling can be an important part of that transition into civilian life. This measure will give veterans the space they need to focus on their studies and their future without the burden of additional financial pressures. As I mentioned earlier, Labor supports this schedule, which is estimated to help around 150 people per year. Removing barriers to training—helping veterans and giving them time to secure the skills they need—is an absolutely worthwhile endeavour.
         </p>
         <p>
          When close to one-third of veterans are unemployed, clearly much more needs to be done. Veterans bring a wealth of skills, experience and qualities that would be ideal—that are ideal—for any employer. Too often, civilian employers who lack the context and understanding of defence life don't understand the skills and personal qualities that service personnel have to offer and what they bring to the table. Many veterans, having only worked in the military, undersell themselves and what they can bring as civilian employees. Delays in securing work make the transition to civilian life even more difficult and can have a huge impact on the mental health and general happiness of veterans.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you consider that around 5,500 ADF members return to civilian life each year—and every year—we simply cannot afford not to invest in helping people to secure meaningful and rewarding work after their defence service. That's why in March this year Labor pledged $121 million for a package designed to give greater support to defence personnel in the transition to non-military life and civilian employment. I'm very proud of that policy, which has been developed through the hard work and relentless advocacy of the member for Kingston and shadow minister for veterans' affairs,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Rishworth" rel="nofollow">
           Amanda Rishworth
          </a>
          , and a number of colleagues on this side of the House who have direct and lived experience of service.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under Labor's veterans' employment program, a dedicated veterans' employment service would be established to give veterans tailored, personalised assistance to find work and make the transition to civilian life. We'd also fund a whole range of other things and an education campaign to help spread the word about the valuable skills, experience and character traits that make veterans an absolute asset to any employer. Labor supports all of the aspects in schedule 1 that I spoke of earlier. Indeed, we'd like them to go further—and that's why I spoke of Labor's own policy and package in this regard—but this is a great start.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also would like to reflect on the second, critically important, measure in this bill—the new suicide prevention pilot that is aimed at improving mental health support for veterans in regional and remote areas. The Mental Health Clinical Management Pilot offers increased support for those who have been hospitalised after attempted suicide or suicide ideation, and targets veterans who have complex mental and social health needs, including homelessness. It will provide intensive and assertive management services to support a veteran after they've been discharged from hospital, which includes support to access other relevant government and non-government treatment services aimed at reducing risk and improving outcomes for those involved.
         </p>
         <p>
          I've had some very recent experience of the very severe stress that serving ADF personnel are under, and I can only say how welcome the changes in this bill will be. I believe that, when it comes to providing those necessary treatments and support to both currently serving and ex-service men and women, we have let the side down on many, many occasions. The family I supported recently in this regard have a lot of questions they want answered about the current services and access, so any improvements in this area that would see us delivering better services for those men and women who are discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt, or who have ideas around suiciding, will be welcome. There is not a more important investment for governments to be making in terms of our support for veterans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Last year, in 2017, it was estimated that 74 veterans took their own lives. Any suicide is an absolute tragedy, but the national pain that we should all feel when serving and ex-serving men and women take their own lives, after having given so much of themselves to the nation, is absolutely gut wrenching. The

           Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
          </a>
          have a report entitled
          <i>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

           personnel 2001–2014
          </i>
          . That report found that while men serving full time or in the reserves had significantly lower rates of suicide than the general population, the incidence of suicide amongst ex-servicemen is 14 per cent higher than the general population. I think that those figures are very sobering and something we should all reflect upon.
         </p>

          The

           Pathways to care
          </i>
          reports spent a great deal of time looking at this tragic issue and found that one in five transitioning ADF members had experienced suicidal ideation or plans or attempts on their own lives in the previous 12 months. These statistics are deeply shocking and utterly unacceptable. There is absolutely no excuse for us not to be doing much, much better in these areas. There are many other aspects—the changes to enabling an extension of the Long Tan Bursary, some assistance for widows and widowers to make decisions and some changes for submariners and compensation issues—that are all extremely important. I recommend this bill to the House.

          <p>
           To varying degrees, both sides of politics in this country have settled on a social contract where as a society together, through government, we seek to look after those that are less fortunate and those that clearly need our assistance, especially when it comes to their health. This obligation to care for our fellow person is even greater when the cause of their suffering is through their service to our community and nation. We owe a debt to those who put their lives on hold in service of our country.
          </p>
          <p>
           When a person enlists with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           , they undertake a commitment to our country and place their health and wellbeing on the line in service to our nation. In return, we should undertake a commitment to look after them and their families both during and after their time in the ADF. This commitment is about more than just their physical health; it is about taking a holistic view of the member and their loved ones. For those whom service has had a greater impact on, we have a duty of care to them and their family now and into the future. While many will leave the ADF having gained much from the experience and view their service positively, for some their time with the services and their subsequent transition back into civilian life can have a negative impact on their physical and mental health. Mental illness can be an impact of war and service. Without effective support and treatment, the impact on veterans and their support network is significant.
          </p>
          <p>
           The critical role of family members in supporting our current and ex-serving Defence personnel is often not acknowledged or appreciated by society as much as it should be. When an individual serves in the ADF, their family serves with them. Military families make sacrifices. We know that many servicemen and women are deployed internationally for months at a time, with this separation causing emotional stress for partners and children. When personnel are not deployed, there are regular repostings to different bases around the country, meaning that they have to choose between uprooting their whole family and living apart for periods of time. Post service, particularly in the circumstances where someone is medically discharged, the impact can be significant and ongoing. When someone is medically discharged, it is often the family who become their carers. It is the family who help and support them. It is often the family who can identify the first signs of mental illness. It is also the family who can recognise the signs and symptoms of poor physical health. But they need support, too.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 contains several measures seeking to improve the lives of those who have served our country and their loved ones. It's the least we can do. Indeed, it's probably even less than what we can and should do but it is at least a start. Transition is a critical juncture in the life of veterans and their families. If not undertaken well, it can lead to worse outcomes for them and their loved ones. This bill seeks to improve this. The first part of the bill recognises the importance of education and retraining for those whose service has had a greater impact on them, whether that be physical or psychological. Further education and training is vital for veterans, particularly when the individual has had no choice but to leave the defence forces and reorientate their lives. Currently, the majority of incapacity payments reduce to 75 per cent of a person's usual earnings after less than a year. Former members of the Australian Defence Force should receive incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earnings when they are studying full time as part of their rehabilitation and integration back into society. This bill will increase their payments up to 100 per cent, providing financial security for veterans and their families. We support this plan and anticipate that about 150 people will benefit from this annually.
          </p>
          <p>
           Education and reskilling can be an important part of transition for those leaving our defence forces, but, for those who have done so due to injury or illness, reorientating their lives is even more important. This payment will ensure that those receiving incapacity payments don't have to worry about finances as well; they can instead focus on getting back up and running. We believe that, through this training, veterans will be better able to move into meaningful employment post-service. In Perth's south-eastern suburbs that I represent, youth unemployment is very high—near 20 per cent. However, more than 30 per cent of veterans who leave the Defence Force are unable to find employment. For veterans who do find a job after leaving the Defence Force, 19 per cent are underemployed in jobs well below their capacities—and they're likely to cop a pay cut of around 30 per cent for the privilege—upon leaving the Defence Force. It is for this reason that Labor has committed to a $121 million veterans' employment program that seeks to ensure that veterans are best prepared to move into meaningful employment and that employers are able to gain the many advantages of hiring these highly skilled individuals. This will include a scheme that converts rank and length of service into an automatic university entrance rank.
          </p>
          <p>
           The things that our veterans have seen and experienced should not have to be witnessed by anyone. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other significant mental health issues are commonplace for veterans, sometimes not becoming apparent for many years after leaving services, and affecting not only those who have served but their families and friends too. The Labor-supported Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, completed last year, has had some especially positive outcomes in the way that we approach these matters. Importantly, it provided a forum to give veterans and their families a voice—an opportunity to prompt much-needed change. For too long, there has been stigma around mental illness and suicide, particularly for our ex-serving personnel. This has meant that some veterans have been reluctant to ask for help, leaving them feeling isolated and often alone. Overcoming stigma is integral to ensuring that those suffering know that they can talk about how they're feeling and to preventing tragedies from occurring. Of course, this is always easier said than done. Through the Senate inquiry, for example, we heard the story of Jesse Bird and the very real and tragic results of not getting post-service care right. Jesse was exposed to significant trauma in his eight months of service in Afghanistan. This caused him to leave the Defence Force. It is clear now that Jesse never received or accessed the care and support that he needed following these traumatic events. Tragically, he took his life in June last year.
          </p>
          <p>
           The risk of suicide among those who have left the service is 13 per cent higher than the general population. This is a figure that can no longer be ignored. This bill will also see the creation of a new suicide prevention pilot to provide greater support to those who have attempted to take their own lives or are at risk of doing so. This program will add to the two other suicide prevention trials currently being coordinated by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Veterans' Affairs
           </a>
           that followed the Senate inquiry and the National Mental Health Commission's review of services for veterans.
          </p>
          <p>
           Schedule 3 of the bill is a logical change that will provide greater support for those recently widowed. I can only imagine that the untimely death of a partner is one of the most difficult times in anyone's life, so to take the pressure off any formal decision-making required through Veterans' Affairs is a welcome one. Currently, such partners have six months to decide how they would like to receive their compensation. These changes will amend the amount of time that wholly dependent partners have to make a decision on the mode of compensation that they will receive for up to two years. This amendment will ensure that those individuals, who are in exceptionally difficult circumstances, have sufficient time to make a decision about their financial arrangements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act in order to extend the eligibility of the Long Tan Bursary to grandchildren of Vietnam veterans, with priority to be given to supporting the children of Vietnam veterans. The Long Tan Bursary offers 37 scholarships of up to $12,000 over three years to children of Vietnam veterans to assist with post-secondary school education and training.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments in schedule 5 will simplify the support available to those who have served as submariners between 1978 and 1992 and have a claim with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Labor is supportive of these measures in recognising the service of these submariners.
          </p>
          <p>
           The final schedule to this bill simplifies the process for veterans applying for compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Under that act a claim for compensation is distinct from a claim for liability. In many cases compensation is claimed concurrently with liability by a member or a former member indicating on the liability claim form that they are seeking compensation, but sometimes these claims are made without an application for compensation. As part of this process, a needs assessment is carried out, which is often conducted over the telephone. Under these changes, if someone were to indicate verbally that they are seeking compensation, it will be considered to be an application, thereby streamlining the process for our veterans and cutting back on unnecessary red tape. No longer will they be required to only submit such a claim in writing. This should make the claims processing easier for veterans.
          </p>
          <p>
           I understand that the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has often alluded to issues surrounding the needs assessment by advocates and members of the ex-service community, as the assessment is used to determine compensation claims. According to those who have spoken to us, the information provided during the assessment has been used to decline or reduce the severity of claims years down the track. The government has now advised that needs assessments are not used to determine compensation but rather to identify forms of support veterans may be eligible for. The government will be providing further clarification to veterans that the online assessment is not used in the calculation of compensation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The long and overly complicated and sometimes adversarial nature of the claims process for some veterans has been raised from time to time. During many inquiries submitters have highlighted these issues, describing the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
            DVA
           </a>
           claims process as 'challenging' and weighing 'heavily upon one's mental health and wellbeing, generally at a time when one is at an extremely low ebb'. Prior to the last election, Labor sought to resolve such issues by undertaking a first principles review of Veterans' Affairs. Our proposal for a first principles review was a holistic end-to-end review of the department based on a set of agreed first principles. The review would examine the department and seek to rectify administrative process failings to ensure the department is actually able to meet existing and future challenges in a clear and efficient manner. Most importantly, such a review would help to re-establish the trust of veterans and their representative organisations in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our Australian Defence Force personnel put their lives on hold in the service of our country. They take risks. They make sacrifices, sometimes committing their lives and wellbeing for the good of our country. In return we must do everything in our power to support them during their service as well as after it. As I've heard when meeting with my local
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
            RSL
           </a>
           s, as I have seen with my friends and my family's friends, as I have discussed with our serving Defence Force personnel when I was fortunate enough to spend time with them last year in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           and Afghanistan as well as on some bases in WA, and as many of my constituents who themselves are veterans regularly remind me these risks and sacrifices and the physical and mental pain that follow are very real. They are hard to manage. They have a huge toll on them as individuals. They have a huge toll on their families. They need our community's full support. These measures and this bill are but a small part in ensuring that we recognise our obligation to our ex-service community. Hence, I and Labor offer our full support for this bill.

            In summing up, I'd like to thank all members who contributed to the debate on this bill and acknowledge the continued tradition of bipartisan support for the veteran community. The purpose of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 is to implement several new initiatives to deliver a range of services to the veteran community and also to their families. The measures in this bill demonstrate that the government is listening and is putting the veteran community first. Each of the sets of amendments will mean better outcomes for veterans and their families.

            I'd particularly like to note two of the more significant measures in this bill. Schedule 1 of the bill will enable veterans participating in a rehabilitation plan and approved full-time study to receive 100 per cent of their incapacity payment. Without this amendment, a veteran's incapacity payments would reduce to 75 per cent or more, depending on their weekly hours worked after 45 weeks. Schedule 2 of this bill will give effect to a new veteran suicide prevention pilot. I've heard many members speak in relation to their concerns regarding the need for greater mental health support for veterans. The veteran suicide prevention pilot will provide mental health support for veterans who have been hospitalised after attempted suicide, have suicide ideation or may be at increased risk of suicide because of their mental health or other factors. The veteran suicide prevention pilot will target a small subset of veterans with complex mental and social health needs, including homelessness.

            I'd like to acknowledge the contribution of members to the debate of this bill, including the shadow minister for veterans' affairs,

            and for their loved ones. She noted we made a commitment to ADF members and their loved ones and that we will support them post their time in the ADF. Again, it was good to see bipartisan support across the chamber. The shadow minister also noted that schedule 1 recognises the importance of education and retraining post service and provides financial security to those who are on incapacity payments and are undertaking further study as part of their rehabilitation plan with the

           <p>
            I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Forrest, who spoke about the evolution of support that widows received by recounting the support her own mother received from Legacy when she was widowed many years ago and that

            now provides support to veterans and their families. In particular, schedule 3 will give partners more time to choose whether to receive the compensation payable for their partner's death as a weekly payment or a lump sum, or a combination of both—whatever works for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to provide further clarification on comments made by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and the member for Bass, and repeated by other members during the debate. The comment relates to the unemployment rate for veterans as being approximately 30 per cent. It's important to note that the latest research on veterans and underemployment would indicate that, in the first 10 months from separation from Defence into civilian life, the unemployment rate for veterans is about eight per cent, which is obviously still higher than the national average but is nowhere near the 30 per cent figure which is often quoted both in the House and in the media. The 30 per cent figure relates to a previous study done by an organisation. The information is somewhat dated. I believe it's important that members are aware of the more up-to-date information and the research being undertaken by Defence and by Veterans' Affairs to get a better handle on the underemployment and unemployment amongst our veteran community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I made the point last week, during an address here in Canberra, and I make the point again today here in the chamber: we can do better in relation to unemployment for our veterans. It's in partnership with our community, the business sector, the corporate sector and industry, along with all government agencies, that we can make sure that we work collaboratively to assist veterans in making the transition into civilian employment. I made the point last week that employing a veteran is simply good for your business. They have a range of skills which have been developed, often over a period of years. They have developed leadership, teamwork and a good work ethic. They're disciplined and have a range of skills that have been taught to them and are easily transferrable to civilian life. It is simply good for your business to consider hiring a veteran in the workforce.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to a second comment by the shadow minister about how DVA uses particular information provided by veterans during the claim process, particularly the online claim process called MyService, I just want to confirm that the responses to questions about lifestyle and needs assessment are not used by DVA to determine compensation but are, instead, used to identify forms of support and assistance the veteran may be entitled to. DVA has now updated the online page on MyService to make it clear that the information is optional and the answers are not used to calculate compensation rates. I commend this bill.
