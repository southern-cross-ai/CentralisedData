        , Employment and Workplace Relations proposes to undertake at a cost of $66.6 million plus GST, a fit-out of new leased premises at block 9, section 31, Canberra city, in the ACT. The national office of the department is located in the Canberra CBD and the Canberra airport, in leases across 21 separate buildings, with a total net lettable area of approximately 97,000 square metres. With the exception of the airport properties, most of the accommodation is in buildings which are over 15 years old and require major research and refurbishment to meet Commonwealth standards.

        The new building will be constructed on the 4,801 square-metre site of the former Queen Elizabeth

       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval and the satisfactory pricing of the tendered trade packages, the integration of the fit-out is the department’s preferred option. Under this arrangement, the fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the base building construction, which commenced in February 2008 and is scheduled for practical completion in June 2010. Occupancy is expected to occur in mid-2010. Current leases have been structured to expire no earlier than mid-2010 to avoid the risk of penalties associated with short-term holding leases.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the construction of new warehousing facilities at an estimated out-turned cost of $36.369 million at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana, Victoria. The project will provide modern, purpose-built facilities to enhance operational capability and provide efficient logistical and warehousing support to defence. It will reduce occupational health and safety issues and operational inefficiencies associated with the existing facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal mainly consists of the construction of a new purpose-built soldier support warehouse and a dedicated receipts and issues area for the existing freight distribution centre. The new soldier support warehouse will be dedicated to the storage of clothing and other soldier support items and will centralise soldier support stock into one building. The balance of the project involves the demolition of vacated and redundant North Bandiana warehouses as well as minor upgrade works to the remaining North Bandiana warehouses to address occupational health and safety issues. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works will commence early next year and be completed by mid-2010. I commend the motion to the House.

        This proposal will be a mixture of new facilities, refurbishment and extension to existing facilities and will include upgrades to the base engineering services, aircraft maintenance facilities, warehousing, new fuel tanker maintenance and liquid dry oxygen facilities, as well as catering and messing improvements. The proposed project will improve the operational and support capabilities assigned to the base, correct limitations and deficiencies with existing facilities in infrastructure and enhance the working environment for base personnel to an acceptable level. It will address occupational health and safety issues and facilities which no longer meet Australian defence standards.

       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake stage 2 of the redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin in the Northern Territory at an estimated out-turn cost of $49.8 million plus GST. RAAF Base Darwin is a major military airbase in the Northern Territory. The base primarily supports overseas deployments and transit operations, as well as major defence exercises. This is the second redevelopment plan for RAAF Base Darwin and seeks to address aged, substandard and dysfunctional infrastructure and facilities which do not comply with current standards. The redevelopment project will involve a new logistics headquarters, office accommodation, a fuel farm, a mechanical equipment workshop, a vehicle wash bay and demolition of redundant facilities. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction phase will commence in late 2008 and be completed in 2011. I commend the motion to the House
