         The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Australian Electoral Commission are proposing to fit out a new office that will be constructed at London Quarter block 40, section 100, Canberra City, ACT. The new office, which will also be occupied by the Department of Education under a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, will consolidate staff from 11 buildings across Canberra. The proposed works will increase operational efficiency, promote greater collaborative work practices and reduce property operating costs. The estimated cost of the fit-out is $149.6 million, excluding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out this project.
