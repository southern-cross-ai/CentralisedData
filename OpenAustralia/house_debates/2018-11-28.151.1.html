       <p>
        This Friday, thousands of schoolchildren across Australia will strike, demanding politicians take action on climate change. Moreover, last month we saw the people of Wentworth vote for action, and last weekend Victoria voted for action. Indeed, every day, people contact me wanting action on climate change. So when will the Prime Minister start listening to the people and stop kowtowing to the fossil fuel lobby? It simply defies belief that this government continues advocating for coal and supporting Adani's plans for the biggest coalmine in Australia's history, when we know the damage coal does to our climate, health and environment. It's a sad truth indeed that the money from the fossil fuel industry is more important to this government than the health and protection of our children and grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of government action, at least our scientists and health professionals are showing the way. For instance, a

        </a>
        report warns that we have only have 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. Half a degree more will significantly worsen risks of drought, flood and poverty for millions of people. This report provides a strategic plan for reforestation, a shift to electric transport systems and greater adoption of carbon-capture technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, our medical professionals have cited climate change as the greatest threat to human health in the current century, with 30 Australian health and medical organisations collaborating to complete the Framework for a National Strategy on Climate, Health and Well-being for Australia, following a year-long consultation. This framework provides an excellent basis for all levels of government to protect Australians from the preventable impacts of climate change through more sustainable health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need leadership and a national response to address climate change right now. Australia must be put on a speedy pathway to zero net carbon emissions, starting with the phasing out of carbon derived energy and a move to 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy. Every effort needs to be made to decentralise energy production, including by turning nearly every building into a micro power station, which would, among other things, create greater energy security for the country. Appropriate incentives are needed, like government grants to assist with installation costs and feed-in tariffs much closer to that charged for centrally produced electricity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nuclear weapons and climate change are probably the only man-made phenomena capable of destroying life as we know it on earth. The government needs to stop enjoying the cash flow from the fossil fuel lobbyists, and start listening to our leading scientists and health professionals and to the Australian community.
