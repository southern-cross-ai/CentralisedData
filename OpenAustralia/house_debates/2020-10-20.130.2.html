       <p>
        Last week I was honoured to attend the launch of the
        <i>
         Inala 4077 Street Names
        </i>
        book. The suburb of Inala is iconic. Not only does it fall in my federal electorate but also it makes up a large part of my good friend Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's state electorate of Inala. Five years ago Aaron Hagenbach published the first issue of this book. It was a limited edition. He gifted two copies to the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group. Late in 2019 local councillor Charles Strunk was given a copy. The councillor was so impressed with the quality and uniqueness of this publication he hoped to donate a copy of the book to each of the school libraries in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        ward of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Lake" rel="nofollow">
         Forest Lake
        </a>
        . After meeting with the history group members, Aaron was contacted and agreed to reprint, so the huge project became a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aaron Hagenbach is an Inala boy. He and his family grew up in the suburb of Inala. He went to local schools and then to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        . Aaron lived in the trees neighbourhood, whilst others lived in the birds or the stars. Inala is a unique suburb. It's probably the only one with street names in such clusters. Then there are the names themselves. There's Ilex Street, Algol Street, Skua Street and many more. Aaron went on a research adventure to work out who named the streets and where they came from. With the help of the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group, he researched every name and then walked every one of the 199 streets with his camera. Today I acknowledge his work in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of Australia
        </a>
        and thank the history group for all of their support for this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I wish to also acknowledge and celebrate the life of Glenda
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCoy" rel="nofollow">
         McCoy
        </a>
        . Glenda was a community leader who was much loved and respected by all those she worked with and supported. I know because I was one of those people who received so much support from Glenda. As a local councillor, and in recent times in my role as the federal member for Oxley, I witnessed her kindness and generosity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glenda was guided by her deep commitment to faith, family and community, whether it be her dedicated advocacy for seniors and the welfare of her fellow neighbours and friends, particularly through the Inala Pensioners League. As Treasurer not one cent was ever out of place and not accounted for. Her smiling face was always welcome in the most trying and difficult of times when community events wouldn't go to plan. As a founding member of the South West Progress Association she was able to support many community events.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a representative, you couldn't ask for someone more loyal and dedicated when you needed help. Election campaigning will simply not be the same without Glenda McCoy working at Richlands East State School on election day. There was a reason I, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, local councillor Charles Strunk and those in the Labor Party referred to her as one of our golden girls. She truly believed in the care of others and a fair go for those in need. On a personal level, I will miss our jokes, laughs and big hugs and the twinkle in her eye. May our golden girl rest in peace.
