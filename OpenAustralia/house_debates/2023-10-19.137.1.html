        Today I rise to speak about a remarkable man and his remarkable migrant story in my electorate. That is Rahim Shah Zaidi. I have a message today from Rahim. He said to me the other day that just because someone may not speak English fluently doesn't mean they lack skills. In fact, the skills within our migrant communities can be truly extraordinary. Almost every week, Rahim will meet with someone in his community who is need of assistance, whether it be in finding a job, just plain welfare or assisting them through applying for a visa, citizenship or permanent residency. I'm pleased that the minister for immigration is here. He is doing a wonderful job cleaning up the mess that was left behind by the former government. Rahim took the time to introduce me to some of those people. We have had some great results in the community thanks to Rahim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rahim also runs the Ghan soccer club, fostering unity among juniors, young men, young women and members from diverse backgrounds. It's not just a football club; it is a welfare club. He looks after the welfare of each and every one of them. Some are very young men who came here as refugees on their own, and he assists them day and night. Between the soccer club, his restaurant and other community groups that Rahim is part of, he works to make sure all migrants feel at home in their new community. It's people like Rahim who make Australia a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current Afghani community and those who are on their way have come and will continue to come to Australia with ambition, ideas and enthusiasm. Time after time, we're reminded that the Afghan community don't only come to Australia for refuge. They come here to build a life full of opportunity and success. It's not only their community; it's all the migrant communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rahim owns a fantastic restaurant at 266 Prospect Road, Kilburn, in my electorate, the Ghan Kebab House. I know that the minister has visited, and I highly recommend, if anyone is ever in Adelaide, to be sure to stop by there. There's great-tasting food and great atmosphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Thursday I had the pleasure to attend with the Minister for Trade a roundtable dinner with businessmen from his community. He brought together members of the Afghan, Nepalese, Pakistani and Indian communities who had all established small businesses in the electorateâ€”small trading businesses in the electorate of Adelaide. It was a gathering that showcased the immense talent and diversity of our migrants and what they bring to Australia. Many of them came here by boats as refugees, and it's people like Rahim and that community, and the people who were at that roundtable, who remind us why a solid visa application process is so important so we can ensure we get people out of harm's way quickly and on to starting their lives here in Australia which contribute to our community.
