        on Broadway performance in Windsor last weekend. It was a toe-tapping evening. One of the many highlights was the opening number. Band members marched in playing 76 trombones. I was delighted to see Winmalee musician Cadet Under Officer Henry Hutchinson in the lead and Springwood's leading cadet Dillen on alto sax. Cadet Dillen on clarinet joined him, along with around 60 others. The three-wing band was formed four years ago and parades six times a year at Richmond, while the Army cadet band goes back to 1992 and parades every Monday night at

        subbranch for their recognition of Vietnam veteran Jeff Bentley, who served as an engineer. It was a privilege to be at the presentation of his unit's extraordinary gallantry citation, pin and star for action during the battles of Coral and Balmoral fire bases in Vietnam in May and June 1968. It was long-overdue recognition.
