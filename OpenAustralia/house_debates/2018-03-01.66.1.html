        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the Liberal-National government is helping to support creation of more and better paid jobs for hardworking Australians in my home state of Queensland, and is he aware of any alternatives?

         I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I live in hope that Labor might ask a question on the economy in today's question time. The member for Dawson is a strong and passionate advocate for regional issues and for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         . We heard from the Prime Minister just a little earlier: 49,000 jobs created in regional Queensland by the Liberal-Nationals government, by business creating those jobs, thanks to the good economic policies of this government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Dawson, like all members from Central Queensland and around the country, is a fighter for local jobs and local infrastructure. He is a fighter for the farming and resources sector, for his people and for regional Australia. That's what we're here for: to represent the people and focus on real issues, like taking pressure off household budgets, families and small businesses, making sure that when they flick the switch the lights come on and the bills stay down. We are fighting every single day to create new jobs: 1,100 jobs a day last year, but there's more to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday I spoke about the Adani Carmichael coalmine project and its related jobs. In construction it will create more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. In operation it will create more than 15,000 direct and indirect jobs, including thousands of workers in Rockhampton, in the member for Capricornia's seat, in Townsville, in the member for Dawson and the member for Herbert's seat, supporting remote workforces. There will be millions of dollars pouring into local economies. The member for Dawson is supporting and fighting for jobs. Is the member for Herbert? On her website it says, 'A strong voice for Herbert'. I ask the member for Herbert to use her strong voice to convince the member for Maribyrnong that these jobs are important. These coalmining jobs are vital. She should get him to get both his faces up to Queensland and tell the truth. Does he back the resources sector? Does he support local jobs in Herbert, in Capricornia, in Dawson and throughout Central Queensland? But don't take my word for it. Queensland Labor resources minister Anthony Lynham said just yesterday that the Indian conglomerates project had leapt more environmental hurdles than any other resources project. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Adani has had the green light since June last year, and we support it and want it to go ahead.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Queensland government says time and time again, let's go.
        </p>
        <p>
         He went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All I can say is there are over 230 conditions, I have never seen a resources project so heavily conditioned than this resources project.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mike Brunker, a former coalminer and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         official who fell just 400 votes short of winning the Queensland state seat of Burdekin at last November's election, said locals were sick of Mr Shorten 'having it both ways' on Adani. He said, 'People up here believe they're being sold out by Labor.' That's a CFMEU official. They believe the Labor Party should be there to support and create jobs. That's what we're here for. That's what the member for Dawson is certainly doing, and I call on the member for Maribyrnong to do the same.
