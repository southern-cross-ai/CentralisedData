        My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the government’s reaction to the latest international action on Iran’s nuclear program?

         I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The government welcomes the United Nations
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         resolution on Iran, which was passed at the end of last week, and it was passed unanimously. The fact that the Security Council should pass a unanimous resolution in relation to Iran’s nuclear program is very relevant. It draws attention to the fact that Iran has failed to comply with two earlier resolutions which did make mandatory the suspension of all Iran’s uranium enrichment and its reprocessing facilities. I am pleased that this decision was unanimous, and it does impose a range of measures on Iran, including a legally binding embargo on the transfer of arms from Iran and limits on arms transfers to Iran. It also expands the list of individuals and entities which are subject to financial and travel measures. Australia will, consistent with the resolution, implement that resolution to ensure that Australia adheres to these international obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having said all of that, it still remains open for Iran to cooperate fully with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         and the broader international community. These measures are reversible, but they are reversible only in the event that Iran suspends its uranium enrichment plant. In my view, the problem for Iran is that, as time goes on, Iran is becoming increasingly isolated. This unanimous passage of a Security Council resolution demonstrates that point, but so does the fact that the Iranian military seized 15 British sailors in the Shatt al-Arab waterway in what the British have said—and the Americans have confirmed—was in Iraqi territory. They have taken those British sailors to Iran. I think it would be very wise for Iran to return those sailors as soon as possible to the British, because, by seizing those sailors, the Iranians are continuing to alienate not just the British and Britain’s allies but also the broader international community.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Shatt al-Arab waterway, where these sailors were seized, is from time to time patrolled by Australian ships. An Australian ship, I think the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Toowoomba
         </i>
         , has recently been patrolling that waterway. I can only say that therefore we have a particular focus on what has happened to the British sailors, and it is important for Iran that it returns those sailors as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say those things, in conclusion, before the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
