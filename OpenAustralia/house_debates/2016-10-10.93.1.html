         I thank the member for Berowra for his question and for his contribution in his first speech, explaining something that we should all have in mind on this World
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         Day—that is, mental ill-health does not happen to someone else; it is not about a group of patients; it is about all of us, wherever we are in society or wherever we are in the community. I really want to thank the member for Berowra for highlighting that so eloquently.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the House on the Turnbull government's real, determined commitment to improve the circumstances of those with mental ill-health. Backed by a promise of an additional $192 million during the election campaign—something that is a personal passion of the Prime Minister, as many of us know—it is all about addressing people who suffer from mental ill-health and telling them that they are not alone, that the services and supports are there and that the stigma is being reduced. Most importantly, the prescription from the National Mental Health Commission was all about introducing a stepped-care model of care so that you do not receive one-size-fits-all care. Depending on where you are in the steps and your particular circumstances, you get either a low-intensity package of care or a wraparound, stronger support that means, particularly if you are being discharged from an acute mental health facility, you will not be discharged into a vacuum but into supports that exist in the community. The Fifth National Mental Health Plan that I raised with state ministers last Friday is all about that. It is all about joining up the support and the services.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, we are introducing a digital mental health gateway, which is about innovative ways of providing support, particularly to young people. About 75 per cent of those suffering from mental ill-health are under 25, which is why we are providing so many resources to headspace, including adding an additional 10 headspace sites, as part of our election commitment. I thank the member for Sturt for his earlier involvement in the headspace model. It is so important to get it right at the early intervention level so that years of anxiety and depression do not follow.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not know what we do not know about suicide and suicide prevention. The Prime Minister and I have announced two trial sites to learn more—one in Townsville, focused on veterans' mental health, particularly those with post-traumatic stress, and one in the Kimberley, where I am heading with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">

         , at the end of this parliamentary sitting to address the scourge of suicide rates in Indigenous communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is so much more to say, but in National Mental Health Week and on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Mental Health Day
         </a>
         I think the key message for those listening is: look after yourselves, realise that the supports are out there and remember that you are not alone.
