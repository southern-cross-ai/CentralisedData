        Scott Braid is one of the principal dealers of the long-established family firm Wagga Motors. I have known Scott for many years, and I knew his father. I have always respected this wonderful family company, a wonderful business that has put the wheels under so many people in the Riverina. Knowing Scott as I do, I know that it takes a bit to get him worked up. But let me tell you: he is worked up about the new vehicle efficiency standard and the push towards electric vehicles. He told me that he remembered when, a few years ago, the member for Cook said that a stringent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV" rel="nofollow">
         EV
        </a>
        push without accompanying infrastructure would kill people's long weekend, and he said that statement is relevant again. He went on to say: 'Moreover, one of the challenges is that EVs are not fit for purpose for most people, especially tradesmen. I'm not denying the need for a greener pathway, but the consumer—that is, those who vote—need a practical, convenient and financial reason to change. A financial stick isn't the answer, in my opinion. As I say, people want to hug trees, but they want to hug their wallet and lifestyle more.'
       </p>

        We really need to listen to the words of someone with the business acumen and experience of Mr Braid. He is really concerned. He sits on the Isuzu Ute Dealer Council, which is one brand that could be significantly impacted by this. They had a meeting recently. Whilst they won't disclose where they're going with this, they are alarmed by the expediency of this policy and the potential for all of their profit going in the first 12 months and then having to question their viability in the Australian marketplace.
       </p>

        Responding to a media release I put out, he said: 'It is really penalising regional based people more than metropolitan based people. I know the caravan world is up in arms as well, because it is pretty much hitting their target audience of people who get a four-wheel drive to go driving around the country. What about the boomers, who are all retiring? They all retire to travel around Australia in their caravans.' He quite correctly asks: 'Where does that leave them? This could well and truly put a handbrake on that, and then what does that do to their mental health?' That's a good question; it's a very relevant question. This is what they have pinned on their fridge. They're looking forward to it, and I'm not catastrophising too much to say it's going to scuttle those immediate plans. It's practical, everyday people such as Mr Braid who we should be thinking about and who the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy should be listening to. Instead, as he so often does, the minister just talks down at these people, who are just worried about the practical realities for regional Australians of this push towards EVs and the new vehicle efficiency standard.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I say, I put out a media release last week, 'Labor's car tax set to punish regional Australians'. I recommend you read it. The Albanese government has plans to jack up prices of Australia's most popular cars and utes as part of its proposed new vehicle efficiency standard and its push towards EVs. A lot has been made of the tradies and the utes, but it's also those people who want these vehicles for their family cars. Despite Australians facing a cost-of-living crisis, Labor has taken upon itself to recklessly pursue these standards, which will hike up the cost of brand-new cars and utes; there's no question. Whilst I appreciate that the minister in question time today talked about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        situation and how it didn't push prices up, we will remind him of that clip when they do push the prices up. Since coming to government, Labor has cost a worker earning $85,000 per year more than $7,600 in lost purchasing power, and now we've got this. People are worried. They're particularly worried in regional Australia where they have to drive more. They were the people who carried the economy through COVID, and they're the ones who are being whacked over and over and over again by this government.
