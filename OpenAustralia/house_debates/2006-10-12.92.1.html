        Employment security lies at the heart of economic and financial security for all Australians. Without job security there can be no security for Australian families and their homes. Homeownership is vital to the security of Australians and their future. Without a job and employment security there can be no home security in the lives of Australians. Today I address my remarks to the people of Ryan and again let them know that the Howard government is working hard to ensure that the record 30-year low unemployment figure of 4.8 per cent will continue. The Howard government will continue to put that at the top of its agenda—ensuring job security, economic security and national prosperity. This will remain its first priority. Does anyone in the Ryan community believe that a Beazley government would have the policy mix to sustain this 30-year low unemployment figure? Of course not. The Labor opposition do not like to be reminded of this, but the Prime Minister and the coalition government will continue to remind them that fairness in the workplace begins with a job—as a very distinguished Labour Prime Minister, the Hon.

        Since March this year, when the Workplace Relations Act was introduced—historic legislation that is all about creating economic prosperity for this country—over 175,000 jobs have been created. So now 175,000 more Australians can contribute to their families and the security of their homes. This legislation will make a big difference to the economic architecture of this country. The people of Ryan will be interested to know that some $11,200 of their taxpayers’ money is spent per minute on benefits for their fellow unemployed citizens. No-one would begrudge the importance of taking care of Australians who need to be taken care of. But the Ryan constituents, whom I have the great honour of representing in this parliament, would equally expect their fellow Australians to seek work where they have the capacity to work and where the jobs are available. In this country employers and businesses are crying out for Australians to fill job vacancies, yet hundreds of thousands of Australians are still not working, notwithstanding our record 30-year low unemployment figure. I commend the legislation to the parliament.
