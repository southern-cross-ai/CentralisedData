        My question is to the Prime Minister: Why is the government claiming that the recommendations of the banking royal commission can't be implemented before the election while, yesterday, saying it was possible to start legislating the recommendations? Isn't the truth that this government just can't be trusted to implement the recommendations of the royal commission?

         I'd say to the member for Cowan that she should have a word to the member for McMahon and tell him to get his skates on and produce a response to the royal commission. From those opposite we've had zip, zero, nada, nothing, zilch! Where is the Labor Party's response to the royal commission? All we have seen is stunts—the Leader of the Opposition, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel" rel="nofollow">
          Evel Knievel
         </a>
         of Australian politics, the stunt master.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this side of the House, we have delivered a 40-page comprehensive response to the royal commission. We are taking action on all 76 recommendations. The Labor Party are telling 17,000 mortgage brokers employing 26,000 people that they don't care about their future. They want to end their business model and they want to send their business to the big banks.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd just say to the member for Cowan that if she was really interested in focusing on those people across her electorate—the 3,173 people who will be hit by Labor's retirees tax and the 9,443 people in Cowan who will be hit by Labor's housing tax—if she really cared for her constituents she would tell the Labor Party to drop those bad policies and produce a formal response to the banking royal commission.
