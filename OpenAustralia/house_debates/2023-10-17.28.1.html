        I rise today to celebrate the winners of the recent Tasmanian Hospitality Association 2023 Awards for Excellence. Once again, northern Tasmania featured heavily in the list of winners, including triple threat the Plough Inn, who got gold for best sports bar, best outdoor experience and metropolitan hotel pub tavern of the year. Manager Di Warren said the team were in shock when they took out the top honours:

       <p class="italic">
        It took a few minutes to realise we had come away with the award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge the care and work the Plough Inn team puts into training and upskilling youth in our region. The fact that many staff have been with the business since the doors opened three years ago is a testament to a strong, positive workplace culture in an industry that has high turnover.
       </p>

        Other winners include the very popular Cataract on Paterson winning gold in outstanding achievement in training and best marketed business and taking out silver for the hospitality, disability and inclusion award. Cataract recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, no small feat in the restaurant industry, and the awards are just recognition for the incredibly hard work of its owner, Karen Burbury. I'd also like to acknowledge young

        , from Cataract on Paterson, who won the hospitality industry rising star award.

        Congratulations also to the Metz, Alchemy Bar and Restaurant, the Tramsheds Function Centre, Sports Garden Hotel and Earthy Eats for their silver and bronze accolades in a number of competitive categories.
