        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Awards have become a proud feature of the south side of Brisbane's community calendar for nearly a decade. We had a wonderful ceremony on Australia Day, held for the first time at the Sunnybank Performing Arts Centre. These awards are all about celebrating the spirit of volunteerism in our community—sadly, something that we do not see as much of as we would like and as much as Australia needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year we have a number of Moreton Australia Day Award recipients—and I will talk about them for as long as I can, but I do have limited time—and, importantly, we also announced the Sir James Killen Award for the volunteer of the year. We were fortunate to have Lady Benise Killen attending again to present the award named in honour of her late husband and former defence minister, Sir James Killen. This year the very worthy recipient of the Sir James Killen Award was Mrs Janeth Deen. Janeth, a former teacher, has been volunteering for over 40 years and shares her time among a vast number of community organisations, including the Muslim Charitable Foundation and the Mt Gravatt Historical Society. Janeth also works with refugees and migrants and each week provides meals to the homeless. I am so privileged to have Janeth in our community. She is a very deserving recipient of this award and was so acknowledged by Lady Killen.

        The other many Moreton Australia Day Award recipients this year were: Trevor Armstrong, from the Pennywort Bushcare and Oxley Creek Catchment Association; Sergeant Jim Bellos—who almost does not need a special recognition—from the

       <p>
        Unfortunately, time prevents me from mentioning all the others. But to Reverend Heather Griffin, Loni Mills, Yani Mills, Ruth Ross-Peer and so many others volunteers in Moreton: thank you for the great work that you do. And thank you again to Lady Benise Killen for the work that you do in recognising the work of our volunteers.
