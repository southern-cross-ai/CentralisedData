        On Sunday I visited the Budgewoi Beach Student Care Project at Budgewoi in my electorate. They were celebrating their 18th birthday. It really brought home to me the wonderful work that they have done. I have visited this project and been with the workers there on many occasions over a number of years. I have seen how they have revegetated the dunes all the way from the roundabout at Budgewoi right down to Lakes Surf Club.

        They are working in conjunction with a number of other groups, sharing their expertise and leading to further work being done all the way to

        lighthouse. It is fantastic to know that we have people with this level of skill and a commitment to this project. There are people who have been involved in it for the whole 18 years that it has been running. I pay special credit to Phil Heaton. He is the coordinatorâ€”the driving force. I think it is worthwhile to look at the support that they have had over the years. They have had four federal grants, totalling over $110,000. They have had grants from the

        Hunter Region Catchment Management Authority totalling $50,000. Volunteers on the ground have contributed 53,000 man hours, which equates to $1,000,590 in dollar terms. There are 750 metres of boardwalk and beach access, at a cost of $150,000. A corporate sponsorship and in-kind contribution of $80,000 has been made. I must mention

        , who always got behind community groups in Shortland electorate and on the Central Coast. There has also been the propagation and planting of 60,000 endemic plants, totalling $120,000. Wyong Council has provided support over the years, making a contribution of $160,000. All this has been done over an 18-year period.

        The site covers 29.5 hectares of coastal land, including several ecologically endangered communities that are being restored and maintained. All tiers of education have been involved and have supported numerous projects over this 18-year period. The vision and aim of the group are to encourage involvement of the community in the restoration of the natural environment. Congratulations, Budgewoi Beach Dunecare. You do a fantastic job and I appreciate your work, as does the community.
