       <p>
        I'm incredibly fortunate to live in an electorate rich in cultural diversity, made up of people from different faiths. On Sunday 24 November I attended the official unveiling of St Nectarios
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox
        </a>
        Church, a heritage listed building in my electorate of Reid that has recently been restored. Over the years, the heritage listed church has become a significant place of worship and celebration for the Greek Orthodox community as well as for the broader community of Reid. In fact, many people come from far beyond the borders of our electorate to visit this church for weddings, christenings and major religious feast days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government invested $300,000 into the restoration and preservation of this important heritage and cultural asset for the people of Reid. An additional $100,000 was contributed through the fundraising efforts of the local church parish. Members of the St Nectarios Greek Orthodox Church community were absolutely thrilled to see the two-year restoration project conclude. The building was originally built in 1879 by the Methodists, and it was fitting that the official unveiling which took place in November marked 140 years since the church was first built. The heritage listed building's sandstone exterior has been restored and waterproofed, new gates and fences have been installed and the internal walls have been replastered. The significant works were only possible through the federal government's Community Development Grants Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's only through a strong economy that we can back community projects like this oneâ€”projects that unite people through their connection to culture and faith, projects that uphold our country's diverse history. When I visited the building for its official reopening, members of the parish were thrilled that the newly restored church is ready for the 50th anniversary of the parish and community's establishment, which is to take place in 2020. I look forward to St. Nectarios Greek Orthodox Church's 50th anniversary celebrations, which will be held next year. I'm certain this newly restored church will be at the centre of much of the celebration, as a symbol of the community's history.
       </p>

        I also wish to commend another organisation in my electorate, which has sprung from migrant roots but now forms an integral part of the community, the Chinese Australian Services Society, known as
