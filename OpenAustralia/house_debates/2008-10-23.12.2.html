        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Australian Super Hornet Facilities Project,

        Base Amberley, Queensland.

       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the Australian Super Hornet Facilities Project at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        , Queensland at an estimated outturn to costs of $117.1 million. RAAF Base Amberley is currently the home base for No. 82 Wing’s F111 aircraft fleet operated by No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron. To support the F111 aircraft fleet, there are significant existing facilities at RAAF Base Amberley. From 2010, No. 82 Wing will transition from F111 to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
         FA
        </a>
        18F operations. The existing facilities will in consequence require modification, extension or reconstruction to support the new FA18F platform effectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will deliver the necessary facilities and infrastructure to support No. 82 Wing operations at Amberley for a minimum 10-year period from 2010. The project scope includes operations, maintenance, logistics, simulation and training facilities and associated engineering services and site works. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in early 2009 for completion in late 2010. On behalf of the government I thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

         I would like to add my support to this motion and in doing so pay tribute to Brigadier Bill Grice and his staff, who are responsible for preparing these extraordinarily complex programs to deliver this much needed infrastructure at
