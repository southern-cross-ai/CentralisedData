       <p>
        In the last few days, I have had two wonderful experiences with the good people of Branxton in my electorate. On Saturday morning I joined the preschool community for the celebration of 30 years of early childhood education delivery—a great achievement. Along with a large number of parents who came along, there was the director, Natalie Caslick, and her very professional team, and Philippa Furner, who 30 years ago was the driving force behind the establishment of the preschool. I congratulate all involved there. I saw them delivering subjects like technology, engineering and mathematics at preschool age. As we all know in this place, we can't start our children on these paths of learning too early.

        Today I met with Branxton Public School right here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , and I was most impressed by the quality of their questions as I shared some banter with the children. I congratulate the principal, Michelle Maier, and all the teaching staff at Branxton Public School. What really stands out for me, and I said this on Saturday when speaking at the preschool, is that everywhere I go in Branxton—the end of year school presentation, the child care, the preschool or local sporting events—the number of parents supporting their children is just phenomenal. I congratulate the Branxton community for the way they get behind their children and devote so much of their time to their learning and future opportunities.
