       <p>
        I take this opportunity to comment on the beautiful township of Oakey in my electorate of Groom. It is a place where I spent a good part of my early childhood: as a boy from a local farm, it is where my family attended church and did business, and it is where I learnt to swim--although not very well!
       </p>
       <p>
        As has been well documented, Oakey has been gripped by the challenge of water contamination with what is known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
         PFAS
        </a>
        firefighting foams, previously used at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakey_Army_Aviation_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Oakey Army Aviation Centre
        </a>
        . These foams have not been used at the base for over 10 years, but the legacy of environmental and health concerns linger on. This is causing tremendous concern for locals, particularly those inside or close to the base's neighbouring investigation area for this contamination. They are frustrated and anxiously awaiting further advice from the federal government, and rightly so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just yesterday I met for another lengthy briefing with the defence minister, Senator Payne, and, whilst time drags on, I thank her for her ongoing overview of this issue. We have completed an environmental site assessment and a human health risk assessment, and an ecological assessment will be released in the coming weeks. The federal government is liaising with various Queensland state authorities, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toowoomba_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Toowoomba Regional Council
        </a>
        and other bodies on issues such as health services, alternative reticulated water supplies to affected properties and potential property valuation impacts. Given the tremendous complexity of these issues, and the fact that similar issues are still being considered around the world, I recognise the process towards a resolution is taking longer than any of us would like.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly though, health risks are judged to be low and acceptable, and the township is fighting back. I have dedicated myself to work through with all those who are concerned, irrespective of their views. I note that just last week Senator Cameron appeared to make derogatory remarks about one of Oakey's leading citizensâ€”the very well-respected Dr Eric Donaldson. I accept that the senator may have been confused, as Dr Donaldson is a medical doctor, a person who was a long-time medical professional on the base itself and a neighbouring affected retired landholder and grazier. To set the record straight, Dr Donaldson is a very level-headed and intelligent commentator on this issue. I applaud him on his balanced approach, probing questions and leadership with others in the Oakey campaign. And I express significant regret that he has been slated incorrectly by Senator Cameron in the Senate just last week.
