        National Water Safety Day is on 1 December. This year the day will once again be focusing on championing water safety. The highest number of drowning deaths happen in the summer. Last year 34 per cent of total drowning deaths occurred in summer and, tragically, there was a 20 per cent increase in drowning deaths across Australia. Males are drastically overrepresented, accounting for 80 per cent of all drowning deaths. This is an issue which is of vital importance to my electorate because the entire western side of my electorate, over 16 kilometres of it, is the most beautiful coastline in the country, if not the world. The beautiful stretch of the

        to Trigg Point, which is a new addition with the changing of our electoral boundaries, is a destination for so many people, not only those in my electorate but those from all over the city and state and, when the

        Our oceans and beaches are absolutely beautiful, but we know that there are dangers, even for the most experienced swimmers. I want to pay my respects and say thanks to the surf lifesaving clubs, and their volunteer members, within my electorate. There are seven brilliant, vibrant clubs: Cottesloe, North Cottesloe, Swanbourne Nedlands,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         City of Perth
        </a>
        , Floreat, Scarboro and, now, Trigg Island. Our clubs have a long history of patrolling our beaches and supporting our community. In fact, the surf lifesaving movement in Western Australia started at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottesloe_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Cottesloe Beach
        </a>
        in 1909. These clubs do all that they can, voluntarily, to keep us safe at the beach but they do need us to do our part as well. This means we should take up the National Water Safety Day challenge and remind people to do the following: swim at patrolled beaches and between the red and yellow flags, wear a lifejacket if boating or fishing, avoid alcohol and drugs in and around water, and supervise children at all times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also need to note that the Curtin electorate clubs have a history of strong leadership and a strong track record of producing outstanding surf sports athletes. This was recognised at the recent annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        National Awards of Excellence, where Trigg Island surf club was named Australia's top surf club for 2021. This national award recognises an outstanding achievement in club development that results in Surf Life Saving Australia clubs providing safer beach and aquatic environments for the community. Given that there are 315 affiliated surf lifesaving clubs in Australia, this is without question a huge accolade and one that is richly deserved.
