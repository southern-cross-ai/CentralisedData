        Among the many events cancelled in 2020 because of COVID-19, my Fisher Community Awards were, sadly, another late scratching. All the finalists had been nominated by my community, the winners had been chosen by our judges and the invitations were just going out when the pandemic shut us down. However, I am delighted to say that those nominees and winners have not been forgotten and their work will not go unrecognised, because in 2021 the Fisher Community Awards will be back with a special bumper double edition. This year I am more determined than ever to recognise the fantastic individuals and organisations in Fisher who are making a difference to our community. At a time when their contribution is even more important, I want to celebrate the people who, during a global pandemic, have changed lives among our students, our businesses, our communities groups, our healthcare providers and our aged-care residences. I'll be opening nominations for the 2021 round of the Fisher Community Awards in mid-January via my website. In March 2021, I'll recognise both the 2020 and the 2021 winners, with presentations for both years' awards. Like many things in 2021, I'm sure this coming year's Fisher Community Awards will be the biggest and best ever.

        I'm working hard in my community and here in this place to advocate to the federal government for funding for upgrades to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Stadium. Most recently, just last week, to help make our case, I facilitated a meeting between the Sunshine Coast mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jamieson" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Jamieson
        </a>
        , local philanthropists, who agreed to contribute $11 million to this project, and the Deputy Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister gave us a very fair hearing, and I'll continue to work closely with him to see whether we can secure funding at the next federal budget. However, because of the underhand tactics of the Palaszczuk Labor state government, the Sunshine Coast Council has been placed under unnecessary pressure to get this project underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the last election, Labor promised $20 million towards this upgrade. These are funds that will be needed for the project to go ahead. Of that money, $5 million is allocated in this financial year, but it comes with a condition that Labor chose to hide during the election campaign: Sunshine Coast Council can only access the money if it is matched by the federal government before the end of this financial year. For everyone who has worked so hard on this project, this is a bitter disappointment. But is anyone really surprised? This goes to prove you have to check the small print with the Palaszczuk Labor government. Their election commitments might look great before the polls close, but when it comes time to deliver there is always a catch for Labor.

         I want to take this opportunity to wish all the Macarthur residents a very Merry Christmas and a happy and safe

         . As the year draws to a close, it's obvious that we've had a tough time—2020 has not been a great year. We started off with horrific bushfires then floods and now the pandemic and the economic recession that followed. Families and local businesses have been doing it tough and as a nation we have, for the most part, fared pretty well in the pandemic. We must continue to keep this under control and look to our economic recovery. Throughout the entire crisis, I have been inspired by the resolve of individuals, organisations and businesses within my community. Throughout this crisis, we have seen great demonstrations of comradery and mateship in Macarthur with people working harder than ever to support their neighbours, their loved ones and their friends. There are countless individuals and organisations I could list but specifically I would like to call out a single, wonderful local organisation, Life Beyond Barriers. I have partnered with Edward Feuerstein and Life Beyond Barriers for my annual Christmas toy drive, with the organisation distributing donated gifts to children in Macarthur who would otherwise go without.
        </p>
        <p>
         I hear bells. It must be Christmas! I've been overwhelmed by the support of local organisations and my local community. A massive thanks to all.
