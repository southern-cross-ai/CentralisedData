        In Petrie we run the Petrie Shield each year, which is in recognition of Mr Andrew Petrie, who was born in 1798 and died in 1872. That is who the federal seat that I represent is named after.

        The Petrie Shield this year has had some winners announced today. At Redcliffe Leagues Netball Association, Bianca Webb, who has been an outstanding support for the young women there, won for community service. At

        I also rise today to speak about the importance of choice and freedom. This weekend Queenslanders have the choice to elect a state government on 31 October. It is a very important choice, because it's about who governs the state for the next four years. One of the biggest frustrations I've had, as a federal MP, is that state governments control the infrastructure and road construction through transport and main roads departments around the country. We can often contribute 80 per cent of the funding, but it's up to the states as to when things start. And in my electorate, it's taking about four years before a sod is turned, which is just way too long. Items like the

        overpass, that has just started, is as quick as it gets, and that has taken 3½ years just to start. Other roads, like the Linkfield Road Overpass, the on and off ramps at Griffin and

        I'm asking people to support the hardworking Liberal-National Party candidates in Petrie, including

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        , they have a great plan—a big, bold plan—for the economy and to fast-track jobs, including manufacturing, to get manufacturing jobs, with $13 million in grants; building two new big dams to waterproof the state, including running hydroelectricity; providing for 30,000 additional places in after-school care; fast-tracking $80 million worth of investment in roads, which I spoke about; and, finally, establishing a new environmental program that will recycle solar panels and provide $80 million for koala habitat. Only the LNP and Deb Frecklington will get the state moving again.
