        Members of the House will be pleased to learn that last Saturday at the annual

         Mardi Gras
        </a>
        Lifesavers with Pride had the honour of being the principal float in the parade and the excitement of performing with English pop sensation Dua Lipa.

        , Lifesavers with Pride is the national group of gay and lesbian Australian surf lifesavers. Their mission is to create an inclusive, progressive and welcoming surf lifesaving culture for the

        community. Surf clubs from within my electorate had the most representation on the float, but participants came from clubs all around Australia to march and promote diversity and inclusion within the surf lifesaving community. Six rehearsals were conducted at Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club in preparation for the performance, one of which I was pleased to join in the week before the parade. On Saturday night over 80 very excited participants, clad in surf lifesaving attire with extra sparkles, marched with Lifesavers With Pride. As the principal float, they received applause from the spectators and were congratulated and complimented on their performance to Dua Lipa's song 'One Kiss'. Over the last 13 Mardi Gras 1,203 people have marched with Lifesavers With Pride. Chair Gary Driscoll should be congratulated for his efforts in raising awareness and support for the gay and lesbian surf lifesaving community.
