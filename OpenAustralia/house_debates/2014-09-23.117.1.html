        I rise today to speak on the first anniversary of the

        bushfires in October last year. Earlier this week I was able to talk, ever so briefly, about the funding from the federal government and the state government that is supporting local community organisations and local councils in building resilience and also assisting with preparation for the upcoming and future bushfire seasons. On 17 October 2013, the Linksview Road fire burnt indiscriminately through the communities of Springwood, Winmalee and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Rock" rel="nofollow">
         Yellow Rock
        </a>
        , causing devastation and heartbreak. The State Mine fire devoured 50,000 hectares, affecting the communities of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Wilson
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Irvine" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Irvine
        </a>
        . It impacted on the Hawkesbury area significantly, requiring evacuations and road closures. The Mount York Road fire burnt more than 8,000 hectares of bushland, destroying homes in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Victoria
        </a>
        . These three fires, spread across the electorate of Macquarie, were significant and required the deployment of many volunteers and emergency service personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of these bushfires was significant, with 208 homes lost and another 191 damaged. I, like everyone else, am deeply grateful that no lives were lost and, while the road to recovery has been hard and challenging, today I see survivors and overcomers—a community that has pulled together to become stronger and more resilient. There were so many to thank for their bravery and courage that day and in the many days and weeks that have followed. A special mention must go to the Springwood Sports Club, the Richmond Club and the Penrith Panthers Leagues Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work of emergency services should be recognised—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        bases Richmond and Glenbrook, the New South Wales Fire and Rescue, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        . I thank also Habitat for Humanity, the neighbourhood centres and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains City Council
        </a>
        . There were many more that I do not have time to name. I also thank the Prime Minister, Minister Payne and Minister Keenan, who were with me on the ground within days of the disaster, acting swiftly to activate relief. I also mention the New South Wales government, who partnered with the government in aid and recovery, which is ongoing. There are many who have worked tirelessly to rebuild their community and support those that were and continue to be impacted by the devastation. They have been noticed and their efforts have not been in vain. With that, I give a special thanks to Morna Colbran, from Winmalee Neighbourhood Centre. She has worked tirelessly over many long hours, on many weekends, with her family coming alongside her to assist her as well, to ensure that the community have every need that she sees met.
       </p>
       <p>
        The journey has been long for those who have lost their homes—it is a journey of unforseen challenges and I acknowledge their hardships and toil. I acknowledge Susan Templeman, who also lost her family home. Many decided to leave the mountains and not to rebuild. This was sad and challenging for our community. Many faced challenges with insurance issues and the changes to building codes and requirements for new homes built in fire-affected areas. These issues continue to be addressed today and I am pleased that through the joint federal and state Flexible Community Grants Program, the Elizabeth Evatt Community Legal Centre will receive funding to conduct seminars that will provide expert advice particularly in the area of insurance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we see homes being rebuilt and the surrounding environment bursting with bouts of new green life. The tourists are returning and recently the Blue Mountains City Council advised that 110 development applications had been received, and the council has been working hard to see these come to fruition. I recently visited Joe Mercieca, owner of Blue Eco Homes, whose business was destroyed during the fires. His business, now rebuilt, demonstrates the passion of this community and his family's passion for rebuilding. They are determined to remain unbeaten and to overcome adversity. I also want to acknowledge the great work of the Blue Mountains Economic Enterprise, who showed initiative with the (re) Build Expo. They too will receive funding to assist in continuing this great work. Disasters and the days that follow are not the time to play politics. This is a time to acknowledge the commitment and determination of a community to overcome adversity.
