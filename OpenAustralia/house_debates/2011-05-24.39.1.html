         Order! The member for Calwell will resume her seat. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition—and I am not trying to deflect the blame from myself—that the member for Canning was on his feet and did interject while he was on his feet. I chose to ignore that and then saw that the member for Calwell had risen and gave her the call. Without trying to predict what is going to happen, I know that my crime is that I have been a bad director of the theatre here and of timing. But I gave the call to the member for Calwell in the flow of what I saw and I will hold by that call on this occasion.

           , where the Prime Minister announced a new payment for them: the prisoner of war recognition payment. This payment, reflected in the budget papers, will provide $500 a fortnight tax-free, indexed and without any income test to veterans who are former

           . Mr Speaker, you will recall that over 30,000 Australians were prisoners of war during the Second World War and the Korean War. This announcement is important. It provides $27 million over four years. It will come into effect as of 20 September this year.

Over this last weekend, I accompanied six veterans to Crete to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete. Three of these veterans were former POWs: Arthur Leggett from the 2nd/11th Battalion,

           We need to just reflect for a moment on the experiences of these brave men during the Second World War and the Korean War. We need to understand the trauma that they experienced. We need to continue to appreciate the courage and resilience they showed and the hardships that they endured. We need to acknowledge that through this payment. I commend the Prime Minister for her leadership and the government for making this payment available during the budget. It is worth reflecting for a moment on how Tom Uren described the payment. He said:
