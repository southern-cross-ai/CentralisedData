        Having the right to protest is a vital part of being a democracy. For me, free speech is a foundational belief. Protests allow all Australians to feel seen and heard about the issues that matter to us. I will never speak out against Australians' right to protest. Unfortunately, lately we've seen some far-from-peaceful protests. There has been property damage at electorate offices; intimidation of employees; and offices shut to constituents, for their own safety. Elderly attendees at a Labor Party dinner in Brisbane a few weeks ago received verbal abuse and were even spat at, shoved and punched. I was there, and what deeply concerned me was who the protesters were. This concern was echoed by a group of respected Muslim leaders I met with recently. I've had protesters at my office who all looked like me, and, at the dinner in Brisbane, so did many of the protesters. Yet, when these people return to their comfortable homes in their leafy suburbs and hang up their keffiyehs in their walk-in wardrobes, who will bear the brunt of public anger about the pushing and punching and speeding? The Muslim leaders I met with are worried that it will be their community members who will be targeted, their children who wear the clothes of their faith who will be blamed and bullied. They're concerned the abiding image of the protests and destruction of property will be that of 'the angry and violent Muslim'. These aren't my words. That's a quote from the discussion I attended. This image does not ring true in Moreton, where we prefer to share a meal and discuss matters—even the ones we disagree on—with sensitivity, with respect and with the aim of finding a constructive solution.

        Sadly, being tarnished with this image is familiar for many in the Muslim community. The memories of the aftermath of 9/11 are still strong. Many Muslims going about their everyday lives were vilified, harassed and discriminated against. More recently, we have seen the abhorrent vandalism of mosques, including a hateful act of leaving a pig's head at the door of one. And, during the last federal election, far-right fringe political parties espoused anti-Islamic immigration agendas. Is it any wonder that Muslim leaders are now worried about a similar pattern emerging? They're concerned about the politicisation in Australia of the war in Gaza deflecting attention from the absolute necessity of focusing on a ceasefire and the provision of desperately needed humanitarian aid—and not just in Gaza but also in the

        and other conflict areas. Thankfully, the violent and abusive rent-a-crowd protesters are a small minority in this country. The responsible amongst us are continuing to strengthen relationships in our communities. That is what will keep modern multicultural Australia strong and cohesive, and that is what all representatives in this chamber, from all parties, should be doing. As the representative for Moreton, the most multicultural seat in Queensland, I'm proud to work on harmony always.
