       <p>
        I've spoken previously in this place, and elsewhere, on the seemingly unending and very distressing crisis we see happening in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . I know that this is an issue that many of my constituents are concerned about. Some of them have reached out to me in my office. I've heard stories of great distress from people with families and friends in the region and from others without a direct connection but caring deeply about the humanitarian crisis we see unfolding. Today, I welcome the words of Senator Penny Wong, in her opening statement in Senate estimates, where she talked of the government using Australia's voice to advocate for a pathway out of this conflict and calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Senator Wong told estimates that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire and getting worse. I'm sure that's not news to any of us. She also confirmed that this government has doubled the core funding to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which has already been delivered. I also welcome the joint statement by the Prime Minister of Australia,

         Anthony Albanese
        </a>
        , along with the prime ministers of Canada and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this is such an important matter, words matter. It's important not to inflame what is happening and undermine the combined efforts of the international community with intemperate words which sound good locally but do greater harm. So I'm going to read the words from the joint prime ministerial statement. The statement reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand today issued the following statement on reports of Israel's planned military operation in Rafah.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are gravely concerned by indications that Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. A military operation into Rafah would be catastrophic. About 1.5 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area, including many of our citizens and their families. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from an expanded military operation would be devastating. We urge the Israeli government not to go down this path. There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is growing international consensus. Israel must listen to its friends and it must listen to the international community. The protection of civilians is paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An immediate humanitarian ceasefire is urgently needed. Hostages must be released. The need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza has never been greater. Rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief must be provided to civilians. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         International Court of Justice
        </a>
        has been clear: Israel must ensure the delivery of basic services and essential humanitarian assistance and must protect civilians. The Court's decisions on provisional measures are binding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are clear that a sustainable ceasefire is necessary to finding a path towards securing lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. Any ceasefire cannot be one sided. Hamas must lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately. We again unequivocally condemn Hamas for its terror attacks on Israel on October 7.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ultimately, a negotiated political solution is needed to achieve lasting peace and security. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand remain steadfast in their commitment to a two-state solution, including the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, where Palestinians and Israelis live side by side in peace, security, and dignity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know many in my community are in great pain over what is happening. I share with them the deep concern and fears over the fate of those caught up in this terrible situation. The Australian government will continue to use its voice to advocate for a pathway out of this conflict and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. To my local community: I hear you, I see you, and I will continue to advocate for you.
