        I often have the opportunity to drop in and see many clubs in my electorate, as everyone else does in this place. I'm very blessed to have some fantastic volunteers and community groups that offer so much. One of those is the Novar Gardens Bowling Club, who are known for their friendly atmosphere and welcoming environment. Tony Spruzen, the president of the club, is one of those people who stands out in the crowd and is always willing to assist and take that extra step to make people feel welcome. Whether you're new to lawn bowls or an experienced player looking for somewhere new, you'll find a home at Novar Gardens Bowling Club. Deputy Speaker, I'm proud to tell you that through the recent allocation of the Stronger Communities Program I was able to present the club with a cheque for $15,000 to go towards a new shade shelter alongside the bowling green.

        I also attended the Grange Uniting Netball Club during a weekend competition day. It was great to see so many of my local community in attendance, together with their families and the children competing. I know that

        , the past president, together with the current president,

        , and their team have been instrumental in driving the fantastic progress at this club. On Saturday, 12 May, when I first arrived at Grange Uniting Netball Club, I couldn't help but notice the fantastic new surface on two of the netball courts—which, I might add, also double up as tennis courts. Jim, Lisa and the team have, through their determination and ongoing fundraising, been able to arrange for this to happen. I had no hesitation in endorsing their application and subsequent $12,000 grant towards this excellent project. I congratulate the Grange Uniting Netball Club for their ongoing contribution towards our local community.

        Additionally, I also have two fantastic multicultural clubs in my electorate—many more, of course, but two that I visited recently. The Pan Rhodian Society and the Panarcadian Association are both passionate clubs of our multicultural Greek-Australian community based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_End" rel="nofollow">
         Mile End
        </a>
        in the heart of my electorate. I've attended many of their cultural and community based events held at both of these community halls, where they put on some fantastic lunches. They have pensioner groups and really service the Greek-Australian community in my electorate. Both the Pan Rhodian and Panarcadian communities established themselves in the 1950s and have over the years contributed to promote their Greek-Australian culture and service to the community. Recently, I presented Mr Con Fragos, the president of the Panarcadian Association, with a cheque for $11,588, which has gone towards the upgrade of tables and chairs. I also presented to Mr John Giorgatzis, the president of the Pan Rhodian Society, a cheque for $15,000 towards the refurbishment of their hall, including painting and resurfacing their floor. This money is just a small contribution that goes towards assisting the valuable work that clubs, such as the Pan Rhodian and Panarcadian clubs and many hundreds of other organisations in my electorate of Hindmarsh, contribute towards—
