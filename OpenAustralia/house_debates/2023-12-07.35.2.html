       <p>
        on indulgence—I have a question for you about a matter of House practice and procedure. As you would be aware, last night the House considered a message from the Senate concerning the Migration and Other Legislation Amendment (Bridging Visas, Serious Offenders and Other Measures) Bill 2023. During this time, the Leader of the House was speaking in an agitated fashion with the clerks about the operation of the standing orders. On any objective measure, the manner in which the Leader of the House chose to engage with the clerks was aggressive and intimidatory and not consistent with the standards of respect that the professional public servants who serve us in this place have the right to expect from members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, can I ask whether you have had regard to ensuring the welfare of the clerks at the table? May I ask you to investigate this incident, including speaking with those involved and reviewing the video? May I ask whether you would make a statement to the House, once you've investigated it, clarifying your expectations as to how interactions between members and the clerks ought to be conducted?
       </p>

        <p>
         I shall deal with the second part of the question immediately. I agree: unacceptable behaviour was occurring in the House last night. I remind all members to act in a professional, respectful and courteous way. I'm unaware of any issues that were raised or any complaints that were made, but of course I will look into the matter and report back to the member. The Leader of the House on a point of order?

         <p>
          I have had a good, positive and constructive relationship, and every conversation I have had with the clerks—ever—has been completely professional. The allegation that has just been made, I dare say, will never be made without parliamentary privilege, and I think that says it all.
