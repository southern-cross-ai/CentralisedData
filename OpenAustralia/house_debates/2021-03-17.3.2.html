       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) there are 300 locally owned distilleries spread across 84 federal electoral divisions, which directly support over 5,000 Australian jobs, with a further 15,000 jobs created through the supply chain including across primary producers, hospitality and tourism sectors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) more than 65 per cent of Australian distillers are in regional and rural areas which bring economic benefits through farm production, manufacturing, regional tourism and hospitality;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Australia has the third highest spirit tax in the world, with spirits taxed up to three times more than wine, cider and beer, disproportionately impacting craft and boutique distilleries;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) it makes no sense to tax grain-based spirits, like gin, vodka and whisky, up to $6 per litre more than grape-based spirits like brandy; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry, it makes practical sense to support our local craft distillers; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) cut the spirits excise rate to the brandy rate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) freeze spirits and brandy

        indexation for three years; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) provide much needed relief to local craft distillers by increasing the current excise refund scheme limit from $100,000 to $350,000 for two years, bringing it into line with the rebate offered to small wine producers under the wine equalisation tax.

        (2) welcomes that the Government's plan is driven by technology not taxes, and the plan is working, for instance:

        (a) we beat the 2020 target by 459 million tonnes;
