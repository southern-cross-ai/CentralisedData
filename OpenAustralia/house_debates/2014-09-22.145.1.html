        I rise to speak today in recognition of some of the outstanding seniors who have been recognised recently as Seniors Ambassadors for Logan.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2009 Robin Gallen was named Seniors Ambassador of the Year for her role as President of the Crestmead 40+ club and, in addition, being an active member of the Logan Seniors Network. Robin has recently resigned from her role as President of the Crestmead 40+ club to focus on a new role as a volunteer at the Logan Entertainment Centre. We could not have a better member of our community representing Logan's seniors. Robin absolutely loves Logan and she says she would never live anywhere else. She also has a great interest in the community and gets involved as much as she can-and sometimes I think her husband, Jim, wishes she would spend a bit more time at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year another constituent, Ann Raymond, was also named Logan's Seniors Ambassador for 2013. Ann volunteers at the Animal Welfare League and the Logan Hospital children's ward as well as being a court support worker. Ann says she has been a volunteer most of her life. She is passionate about giving back to the local community and enjoys a sense of fulfilment achieved through helping others.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year I am proud to say that another Forde senior has been given the title. Mary Bickerdike has been involved in the local community for some 30 years. She volunteers for the Cancer Council promoting the 'Slip, Slop, Slap' program through local schools. She is also Vice-President of the Logan City Theatre Company. Mary is also a member of the Logan Mayoress' Community Service Committee and is passionate about helping those less fortunate, often visiting people who have been through tough times to offer support and assistance. As a fundraiser, Mary has been involved in many numerous toy drives, food parcels, raffles and barbecues to raise money for the Logan mayoress community benefit fund, which last year raised more than $200,000 and helped over 30 local community groups and charities as a result.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am extremely humbled by the efforts of Robin, Ann and Mary in the local community. They are tremendous assets to the local community. But there are many more seniors also following in their footsteps. It is our seniors that are the backbone of the majority of our volunteer organisations. I would like to take this opportunity to formally acknowledge the many seniors in Forde who do wonderful community work and make our community what it is. I look forward to catching up with many of them at our annual Forde Seniors Expo this Friday.
