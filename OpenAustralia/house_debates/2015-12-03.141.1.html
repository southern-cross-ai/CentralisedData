       </p>
       <p>
        As the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        is implementing new technology into air traffic control towers, known as the Integrated Tower Automation Suite, to combine flight and operational data, surveillance and voice communications into a single, integrated, tower-specific layout. To achieve this outcome, Airservices Australia is proposing to refurbish the existing facilities and upgrade supporting infrastructure to extend design life at Brisbane and Cairns airports.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Brisbane and Cairns towers were built in 1987 and 1990 respectively. The fit-out and supporting infrastructure is from the original installation and is at the end of its design life. The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth, and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction works of the Brisbane tower are planned to commence in late 2016 and be completed by mid-2017. The construction works for the Cairns tower are planned to commence in early in 2016 and be completed by late 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The project will provide fit-for-purpose facilities to support and sustain the operation and maintenance of the Growler aircraft capability. The project works include civil works, living accommodation, administration facilities, logistics and maintenance facilities, training and simulator facilities, multistorey car parking, landscaping and demolition works. Once again, the government is committed to delivering world-class defence capabilities to support our soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen in their roles at home and abroad.

        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project is valued at an estimated $348.6 million, excluding

        . This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, construction, Defence contingencies and information technology equipment. This investment will provide local employment opportunities for subcontractors in Queensland and the Northern Territory and will provide economic benefits for local business and industry. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2016 with completion expected at all sites by mid-2021. I commend the motion to the House.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: Melbourne and Brisbane air traffic services centre—extension works.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence are proposing to replace their existing air traffic control systems with the new civil/military air traffic management system being delivered under the OneSKY project to provide a common platform for provision of air traffic control in both civilian and military controlled airspace. To achieve this outcome, Airservices is proposing to extend existing facilities in Melbourne and Brisbane to modernise the facilities and upgrade the existing supporting infrastructure to enable delivery of the new system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works comprise new air traffic services centres, which include controller rooms and amenities, in Melbourne and Brisbane to house the new air traffic control consoles and associated facilities. The existing air traffic services buildings in Melbourne and Brisbane will continue to contain air traffic control support facilities and, following the decommissioning of the existing air traffic control system, will be repurposed to house non-operational staff.

       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        As the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Department of Defence is proposing to construct new fit-for-purpose facilities to support the Royal Australian Air Force's primary training area for air-to-surface weapon deliveries at the Delamere Air Weapons Range, Northern Territory. The Delamere Air Weapons Range includes targets representing an airfield complex, an urban environment and a fuel storage complex. The range also includes a high-explosive impact area, practice bombing impact zone, practice rocketry impact zone and air-to-surface gunnery lanes. The project will support increased exercise activity and the desire from coalition partners for increased exercise access and greater operational fidelity. The project will also support the safe employment of the Air Force's weapons capabilities and the new Growler mobile threat training emitter system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out.

       </p>
       <p>

        Battlefield Airlifter aircraft and support systems for the Australian Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The C27J Battlefield Airlifter aircraft is replacing the Caribou aircraft, which was retired from service in 2009 after a career spanning more than four decades. The flexibility of the C27J allows it to undertake a wide range of missions, from delivering ammunition to frontline troops to undertaking aeromedical evacuation of casualties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project includes a new headquarters building; hangars; a new apron including high-mast lighting, airfield ground lighting and hydrogen refuelling points; maintenance and deployment facilities; new training facilities; space for a flight stimulator and fuselage training stimulator; and associated engineering and site works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will also construct facilities to replace functions displaced by the Battlefield Airlifter operational facilities and relocate a heritage building on the base.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out.
