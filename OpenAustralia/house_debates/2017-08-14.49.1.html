        I rise today to speak about the Prime Minister's recent visit to my electorate, to the beautiful Kimberley town of Broome. It was such a wonderful opportunity for the Prime Minister to visit my electorate. In particular, I think it was incredibly uplifting, and I have to say that the community made the most of the visit. The visit coincided with the announcement that the Kimberley would receive $8.7 million in federal funding through the Building Better Regions Fund, which includes an investment into a cultural centre which is to be owned and operated by the Yawuru Aboriginal corporation. Whilst in Broome the Prime Minister and I took the opportunity to meet with Peter Yu, who is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Yawuru, to discuss the issue of youth suicide in the Kimberley.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the Prime Minister was in Broome he also took the opportunity to meet with a whole raft of community members, but a highlight was meeting the schoolchildren from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broome_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Broome Senior High School
        </a>
        as well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's
        </a>
        and various other schools in Broome. Of particular note was a small group of children who drove down from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Arm_Point" rel="nofollow">
         One Arm Point
        </a>
        . This is a two-hour drive for these young people, on an unsealed road, to meet with their Prime Minister. And I can tell you, they were the highlight of the trip. Coincidently, this government has committed some $50 million to sealing the road that these young people drove on, which is called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Leveque_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Leveque Road
        </a>
        , so that the next time the Prime Minister comes to Broome and they come to visit him their trip, I can assure them, will be shorter and much more comfortable.
