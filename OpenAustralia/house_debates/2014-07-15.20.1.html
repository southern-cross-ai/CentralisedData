       <p>
        Recently I had the pleasure of meeting Kristy Chidgey,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Sarah Wilson
        </a>
        and Christine Davis, founders of an outstanding charity organisation in Dobell called Share the Love, which they established three years ago. These three women shared a vision to assist young mothers in meeting essential needs for their young children. Share the Love operates by accepting referrals from other local agencies who offer support to young mothers in need. Having started in Kristy's garage, Share the Love quickly grew and before long had to relocate to larger premises in Gorokan. It is the hope that one day Share the Love will occupy a factory bay and office in order to provide greater services to local families.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I visited the Share the Love office I was impressed by the achievements and dedication of Kristy, Sarah and Christine. Through their hard work and commitment, Share the Love has collected a large supply of clothes, cots, nappies, bottles and other essential items required by new mothers to care for their babies. Of course, there is always more that can be done, and Share the Love acknowledge that their services are in high demand. They are growing bigger and better every day. Remarkably, Share the Love has grown without any government assistance, highlighting what can be done when good people put their minds to helping their community. This parliament should give credit to Kristy, Sarah and Christine for their leadership in identifying a need in our local community and developing a service to address it. I wish Share the Love all the very bestâ€”
