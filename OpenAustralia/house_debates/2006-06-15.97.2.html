       <p>
        I rise today to speak on behalf of cleaners on International Cleaners Day. Many members opposite may not be aware but today is the day that we acknowledge all cleaners for the wonderful work they do. I want to take this opportunity to recognise and congratulate the cleaners on the fantastic work they do here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and in our electorate offices; many of you may even have cleaners who clean your homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of us take it for granted that we can turn up day in, day out and find our offices spotlessly clean—the carpets clean and vacuumed and our desks freshly wiped and shining. All these things happen because of the hard work that people do as cleaners. They come in at odd hours while we sleep in the comfort of our beds or are enjoying the comfort of our families around the dinner table. At these times, the cleaners are out there cleaning our offices and workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thought it important that I do bring this up, having grown up in a family in which my mother was a cleaner for many years. I saw the hard work that she put in for very low pay for many years. As I said, when I was young she cleaned offices in Adelaide’s central business district. Her hours were similar to those that many cleaners work today, and for little remuneration. Her work caused her to miss some of the most special occasions a family can share together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Things have not improved over the years for many people who perform such work. The introduction of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        industrial relations legislation by this government means that workers in low-paid industries such as cleaning will need our support to ensure that they can achieve a decent standard of living. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        estimates that there are 3,031 commercial cleaners in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . Of these commercial cleaners, 40 per cent are from non-English-speaking backgrounds, over 50 per cent are women, about 50 per cent are parents with dependent children living at home and over a third left school before completing year 12. Most cleaning jobs are part time or casual, and cleaners face job insecurity and often have two or three jobs to make ends meet. The average income for a cleaner in Australia is $8,200 per annum, which is well below the poverty line. So I would like all of you today to show your support for some of the most vulnerable workers in our society by supporting the Clean Start campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that today there have been many events organised around Australia by cleaners and their union, the miscellaneous workers union. I know there is a rally planned here in Canberra and one in Adelaide. It is very important that we pay tribute to the cleaners who clean the federal parliament. I congratulate them and acknowledge the work they do for very little pay—cleaning being one of the lowest paid professions. I also take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the cleaner who cleans my electorate office day in and day out, Mardi Battye, who does a wonderful job and should be congratulated. I ask you all to support the Clean Start campaign. By supporting this campaign you will be supporting some of Australia’s lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.
