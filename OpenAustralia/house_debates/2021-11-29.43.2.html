        The federal Liberals failed us with a botched vaccine rollout program. The New South Wales Liberals divided Sydney, treating

        as second class—against health advice. At this weekend's local government elections, the Liberals flee for cover. Longstanding Liberals in Blacktown are labelling themselves as a coalition of Independents.

        gurus who thought this up have built up a coalition of cowards. They've never stood up for our community to get a fairer deal during lockdowns. They watched Western Sydney subjected to harsh, unfair rules. They did nothing, unlike the mayor of Blacktown, Tony Bleasdale, who I was proud to join in calling for major vax hubs to be set up around

        on Blacktown council have a history of cuts to services and support. The Liberal Independents won't even say what they'll do if they win. I'm proud to support Tony Bleasdale and his Labor team, who have stopped the cuts, reopened Mount Druitt pool, pushed for better investment in the community and brought the

        to our city—with 5,000 students to benefit. They are rejuvenating Blacktown CBD and planning a modern Marsden Park CBD. They kept council workers employed when the federal Liberals wouldn't provide JobKeeper support. They are building up—and standing up for—our area. They are proud of who they are and don't claim to be Independents. I respect very much the people in our area. They will make their own minds up about who they vote for, but they can send a message. These Liberal candidates dressed as Independents are disrespecting voters. They hid during lockdown. They are hiding now. See through their tricks.
