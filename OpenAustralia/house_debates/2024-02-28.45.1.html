       <p>
        I met Patrick and Linda Brennan from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Deception Bay
        </a>
        at the Moreton Downs State School year 6 graduation in 2023. I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of their 12-year-old daughter, Jade, from an incurable brain cancer called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIPG" rel="nofollow">
         DIPG
        </a>
        affects only 20 Australian children per year; it's an aggressive childhood cancer. All families around Australia affected by DIPG are doing what they can to raise more awareness about the disease, which isn't commonly known.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jade had her whole life ahead of her, but on 31 January 2023 she was diagnosed with an inoperable and terminal brain tumour. Jade fought very hard until the end. Patrick, her father, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pain and trauma that has affected my family, as with all families in the same situation, is ongoing and we will never forget our kids. At the same time, our kids never got the opportunity to grow up, finish school, get married, have kids, and make their own difference in this world. DIPG is cruel and unforgiving.
       </p>
       <p>
        Watching your child go through an incurable and cruel disease is something that no parent should ever have to do in this world. Patrick, Linda and their entire family all fought hard with Jade, with everything available to them, yet the outcome couldn't be changed, and on 18 August Jade passed away. To Jade's family and friends: I know Jade had a positive impact on your lives and will be forever missed. Rest in peace, Jade.
