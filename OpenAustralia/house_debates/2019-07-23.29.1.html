        It's the second day of the second week of this tired third-term government, and we're already seeing just how threadbare their agenda is. What is the government's agenda in this place this week? It's confected political wedges on drought, confected political wedges on national security and confected political wedges on the trade union movement and on asylum seekers. I suppose that is better than their agenda in the Senate this weekâ€”last night they ran out of any legislation to debate whatsoever.

        After this sitting period, what will those opposite have achieved for the voters who sent them here? Nothing. They won't have improved their healthcare or their education opportunities. They won't have improved their prospects of getting a job or pay rise. They won't have made a contribution to the fight against climate change. All they will have to show for a fortnight's work is headlines for journalists interested in the theatre of political tactics. Those opposite haven't yet realised that the election campaign is over. The Australian public deserves better, and the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        is up for a better. Anytime those opposite want to stop campaigning and start governing, we'll be here as constructive partners in this parliament, because we're here to serve the Australian public. That's the side that we're on.
