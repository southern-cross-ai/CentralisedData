        [by video link] My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House how the Morrison government's fiscal discipline and careful approach to policymaking is enabling us to continue providing substantial economic support as our economy meets the ongoing challenges of COVID-19?

         I thank the member for Lindsay for her question, and I acknowledge her experience in the not-for-profit sector before coming to this place but also her Olympic connections, because her husband, Stuart, is a two-time Olympian for Australia and was the early coach of

         , our wonderful gold medallist. I thank Stuart and note those connections.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Lindsay is well aware of the significant economic support that is being provided to the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         right now and, indeed, to Queensland and recently to Victoria and to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . Income support: $750 per week for people who've lost 20 hours or more, $450 a week for people who've lost between eight and 19 hours of work and $200 a week for people who've lost more than eight hours of work but are also on income support. This household support, these payments to families and to workers, is on top of the business support that we're providing.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Victoria, we joined with the Victorian government in a 50-50 split on a $400 million business support package. In New South Wales, on a 50-50 split we have reached with the New South Wales government, we are providing for businesses with a turnover between $75,000 and $250 million who have seen their turnover fall by 30 per cent or month between $1,500 and $100,000 a week based on the size of their payroll. This is very significant economic support. We've also been speaking to the banks who've agreed to provide relief to their customers, their small and medium-sized business customers.

               right now are doing it tough, and the Morrison government is standing by them, like in the member for Lindsay's own electorate, Karen and Alan of the Nepean Aquatic Centre have said that their receipt of the income support and the business support is going to help get them through and without it they would have a much more uncertain future. That is an employing business in the member for Lindsay's electorate. We continue to provide support and stand by the businesses and the people of New South Wales.
