       <p>
        Back in 2007, when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Ford Australia
        </a>
        said it was closing its engine plant at Geelong, the announcement sent shockwaves through our city. As it transpired, Ford did not close its engine plant in 2010, but that crisis of confidence in our economy did bring about something positive for our city. The Geelong community, together with industry and all three tiers of government, were determined to ensure a strong future for Geelong's northern suburbs—our 3214 suburbs—where traditionally many workers from Ford and other manufacturing industries have lived.
       </p>
       <p>
        Out of this process, Northern Futures was born. Its focus is on driving jobs growth in a part of Geelong where employment has been on the decline. It is built on the belief that in Geelong our future is very much in our own hands. Its mission is to ensure that, where there is economic activity occurring within the 3214 region, that economic benefit ought to be shared with the people who live within 3214. Pathways to a Brighter Future, a program that is being run by Northern Futures, is a home-grown program using the strength of our community—our networks, our businesses and our people. It is people helping people with a working framework that is flexible and focused on achieving realistic goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pathways to a Brighter Future is taking the most disadvantaged job seekers, who may have grown up in families where work was scarce and who missed the opportunities of a complete education. These people are supported through training programs and prepared for work in industry sectors where the skills are needed. The first 17 trainees are on their way and, when they are finished with certificate

        or III qualifications in transport and logistics, they will be job ready and placed in employment. Participants in hospitality and aged care training will start later this month. The aim is to have long-term unemployed people in jobs by the end of the program—that is, people whose lives will be transformed and whose families will have a breadwinner in their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a fantastic outcome from an idea born of necessity. It is a tribute to the drive and commitment of the Geelong community. It also represents real hope for the northern suburbs of Geelong and for those people who will be supported through the training process into the workforce. The Northern Futures industry partners tell us a lot about our ability as a community to band together. I must acknowledge the
