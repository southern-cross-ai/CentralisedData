       <p>
        Today I rise to draw the House's attention to the wonderful students at Wales Street Primary School in my electorate of Cooper. The students, led by Arielle Butera, are just some of the many young activists in my community calling for strong, urgent action on climate change. In December I received their petition with over 54 signatures in support of action to tackle the climate emergency. Arielle says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't think the government is doing enough about climate change or just doesn't care about it and that's a problem because I thought that government was meant to look after Australia not just let it be destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Arielle, I agree. While the rest of the world has accepted that we are experiencing a climate emergency, it's clear that this is not a priority for the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Those who sit opposite are collectively burying their heads in the sand, with no desire or political courage to start to repair the damage that global warming is inflicting on our planet. This must end now. As Arielle says, 'Help protect our future by doing something about it.' I stand in solidarity with all of the young people in my electorate who are standing up and demanding action on the climate emergency. We can, and we must, win this fight. I will be with these young students every step of the way. The signatures on this petition are from children ranging between seven and 11 years old. They deserve to be heard, and I'm very proud to bring their voices to this House today.
