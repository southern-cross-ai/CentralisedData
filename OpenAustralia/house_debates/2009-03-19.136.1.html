           first came into effect in this country. The third anniversary is just one week away. We come today to this parliament to complete what the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           promised the Australian people in 2007: that we would rip up and get rid of Work Choices forever, for all time. Those opposite have fought us every step of the way.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite would now have us believe that somehow they are not associated with bringing Work Choices to this country. But if we tell the truth about the three years from 27 March 2006 til now, it is clear that Work Choices was the product of the Liberal Party and is still the policy of the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister in the government that watched the Work Choices rip-offs and did nothing. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that the Liberal Party should go further than Work Choices. The shadow Treasurer was the Liberal Party’s preferred salesperson for Work Choices. The member for Menzies, who is leading the Liberal Party’s policy review, was the minister who introduced Work Choices. The man calling the shots, the member for Higgins, was the architect of Work Choices.

            The Liberal Party
           </a>
           is the party of Work Choices now, today and forever.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the three years between 27 March 2006 and now, we came to this place, against the fierce opposition of the Liberal Party, because of the goodwill of Australians and because of those people right around the country who campaigned against these laws because they knew that they were un-Australian and wrong for this nation. They were trade unionists and non trade unionists; they were people from churches and people of no faith; they were people who were born here and people who were born overseas; they were from every part of the country. They gathered under the banner of ‘Your Rights at Work’ to get rid of these laws.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are here because the Labor Party campaigned against these laws and committed itself in its detailed policy documents to getting rid of them, ripping them up and eradicating them for all time. I would like to thank every Labor member of this House who campaigned for that outcome. That is why we are here today. In bringing these laws to the parliament, we not only published incredibly detailed policies but, once elected, went through an incredibly detailed consultation process. There was no railroading for us, no arrogant dismissal of other people’s views. We have taken on board sensible suggestions every step of the way. That is why we formed a business advisory group and had it meet so frequently. That is why we formed a small business working party and had it meet so frequently. That is why we had a workers advisory group and had it meet so frequently. That is why we took the unprecedented step of making available to the committee on industrial legislation—experts on workplace relations laws from around the country—the legislation before it came to this parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           During the course of this parliamentary debate, we have been prepared at every stage to accept good ideas that were in accord with our election mandate. The government is making a significant number of amendments and in part we are doing that because we have accepted the legitimate suggestions of those who, like the Labor government, are opposed to Work Choices. We have accepted the legitimate suggestions of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Greens
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
            Senator Fielding
           </a>
           and Senator Xenophon. Those amendments are being put forward for the House’s consideration today because they accord with Labor’s mandate and they accord with the commitments that we gave to get a detailed policy to the Australian people and to enact that detailed policy in consultation with those who desperately care about this policy and want to see it work well.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments in this motion are being brought forward in that spirit. But the House will shortly deal with amendments that are not being brought forward in that spirit, amendments that are being brought forward as the last desperate twisting and turning of the Liberal Party to hold firm to Work Choices. What the Liberal Party wanted in this debate was not a spirit of cooperation and goodwill, not a spirit of ‘can do’ to get rid of Work Choices, but to take every excuse, every point, every procedural device to ensure that Work Choices staggered through for another day. Their belief in Work Choices is one of the few things that still unite the Liberal Party in the modern age.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is no doubt that, should the Liberal Party ever be re-elected, Work Choices would be back. Well, at least in future elections they will be judged against that test, because they were never judged against that test in the past. In 2004, when they went to the Australian people, they never breathed a word of Work Choices. The one thing you can say about the Liberal Party of this country is that they never tell the truth on workplace relations. They did not tell the truth in 2004 and then they foisted Work Choices on this country, bringing it into effect in 2006 and doing so much damage to hardworking Australians. We are sweeping that away, opposed every step of the way by the Liberal Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments under consideration today go to a wide range of issues of fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. This includes the early commencement of Fair Work Australia and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
            Fair Work Ombudsman
           </a>
           , the expansion of matters to be covered in the fair work information statement and the inclusion of right of entry. This is primarily to address concerns raised by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
            Privacy Commissioner
           </a>
           to deal with the inspection of non-union member employee records and to strengthen the protections around right of entry for compliance purposes. There are amendments about outworkers to ensure the right of entry framework minimises the risk of unscrupulous employers destroying relevant records. There are amendments about greenfields agreements to ensure that new projects or businesses are not delayed by red tape in negotiating enterprise agreements that will apply. There is an amendment about the right to request flexible working arrangements for carers of children under 18 years of age with disabilities. There are amendments committing to an examination of the use of individual flexibility arrangements, further research into flexible working arrangements and requests for extensions of unpaid parental leave.
          </p>
          <p>
           These amendments strengthen the Fair Work Bill. We have been prepared to accept amendments from people of goodwill, from people who were opposed to Work Choices, and consequently many of them have come forward from Senators Fielding and Xenophon and from the Australian Greens. I thank them for their contribution to this debate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, the sticking point in this debate, which we will deal with soon, is the attitude of the Liberal Party, which of course finds it all very amusing as it twists and turns in its political desperation to keep Work Choices. Anybody who watched the Senate last night saw the ugly face of the Liberal Party on display as it did that twisting and turning, and we will inevitably see more of that today. What the Australian people voted for is what we are determined to deliver: fairness, balance and flexibility in Australian workplaces. I commend the amendments to the House.

             . The Prime Minister talked yesterday about putting the electrodes back onto the body of Work Choices. Well, let me tell you: the only people applying those electrodes are ‘Dr Rudd’ and his companion ‘Dr Gillard’. There they are, trying to revive it for political purposes.

             We can have debates here about policy and we can have debates here about politics, but what we have here today is a debate about nothing more than pig-headedness. What we have are a government that brought their legislation so incompetently drafted, so pathetically prepared, that they have already agreed to 225 amendments—and they thanked the Independents and the Greens. ‘Thank you, Senator Xenophon,’ the Deputy Prime Minister said. She was so sanctimonious about that. The reality is that the key amendments here are the amendments we supported—the changes to right of entry and the changes to greenfields sites. Those are changes that we fought for, and they would never have been achieved without our advocacy. But what is holding us up? Why are we still here? We are here because the Deputy Prime Minister is so colossally stubborn, so vain, so determined to wring the last bit of political value out of this.

              become a revival of Work Choices at the hands of the Deputy Prime Minister because she is too stubborn, too pig-headed, to agree to a sensible, realistic change to the definition of small business—something that will make a bad change less bad, something that will result in fewer job losses, something that will preserve employment in small business—and because she is too stiff-necked to bend to that amendment, even though she has agreed to 225 others. We saw the whole movement to change the industrial relations laws that the union movement put tens of millions of dollars into. They spent so much time advocating it, and now, thanks to an incompetent lawyer, they are going to run it into a brick wall.

              We have talked about ambulance chasers in this place. The real problem is when you pursue a political goal and then discover you have run into a brick wall. That is exactly what the Deputy Prime Minister has done. The only reason we are here today, the only reason the government is not compromising, is that it wants to make one last pathetic political attempt to prop up the incompetent, bungling state government of

              . One last pathetic point, then you will have to go back to your friends in the union movement and say: ‘We’ve crashed the whole plan. The whole project has been crashed over the difference between 15 and 20 full-time equivalents.’ That is what you have crashed the whole project over.

               Beyond all the rage and the theatre that we are seeing in the chamber today, beyond this pantomime, I want to remind the Australian people what we are actually here debating at the cost of $1 million a day to the Australian people to keep this parliament here. We are debating in this parliament, in a climate where unemployment is skyrocketing, whether we are to give small business the confidence and the incentive to employ more Australians. That is exactly the issue that we are debating here today. The reality is—and you can ask anyone in small business around the country and they will tell you the same—neither the Deputy Prime Minister nor the Prime Minister, nobody on that side of the House, understands small business. They do not understand the struggles that Australian small business goes through on a daily basis. They do not have that life experience. They do not understand what drives small business to create employment.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was an article in the
               <i>
                Australian
               </i>
               this week that said they went to the Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate and down to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Street" rel="nofollow">
                Main Street
               </a>
               , in Altona, I think it was—I am happy to be corrected. They went into the local pizza shop there, apparently one that the Deputy Prime Minister likes to visit. The next time she is there, she might like to ask them how many employees they have on the books. I bet you, if they are a pizza shop that has two shifts a day, which is very realistic, they will have more than 15 employees on their books. That is the reality and that is the reality of small businesses all around the country. The idea that having more than 15 people on your books means that you are no longer a small business is, quite frankly, absurd. We stand for a more realistic definition of ‘small business’. We want that pizza shop in Altona to be classified as a small business, as is appropriate, and we want that to happen so they can have the confidence to employ more people. Nobody in small business believes that this government understands either what small business goes through or what small business is required to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Deputy Prime Minister consistently refers to the mandate that the government received at the election in 2007. Nobody on this side of the House disputes that the Labor Party have a mandate to change Australia’s industrial relations system. What the Labor Party were not elected to do was to come to Canberra and do whatever they liked to the Australian industrial relations system. They had a very detailed policy, which is contained within these two documents I have here.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Deputy Prime Minister will have you believe that somehow Moses brought these documents down from the mountain—that they cannot possibly be altered, which is why the Labor Party cannot move from a definition of small business being 15 employees. But let us have a look at these documents and see where the Labor Party has trashed its own policy. I refer to the policy release of April 2007—Forward With Fairness: Labor’s Plan for Fairer and More Productive Australian Workplaces—where they talk about agreement making:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Labor’s good faith bargaining rules will not require an employer or employees to sign up to an agreement where they do not agree to the terms.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yet what we find within the Fair Work Bill is that this has not translated into that bill. Within the bill there is compulsory arbitration, which is totally against the policy that they took to the people at the last election.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the implementation plan that was released in August 2007—and this is an absolute corker, because it is very simple to understand—this is what Labor said about right of entry:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Labor will maintain the existing right of entry rules.
              </p>
              <p>
               When that is translated into the Fair Work Bill, what we find is that union right of entry has been massively expanded. Union officials were given the power to go in and seek any employee record—not just those of union members—within a business. They could get access to all sorts of private records.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a very simple debate today. It is a debate about giving small business the confidence to employ more Australians. Nobody on that side of the House has any idea of the struggles that are facing small business today. They do not know that small business needs to be given the confidence to do what it does best: create employment.

               <p>
                I rise very briefly to put my views on the record and to say, ‘Oh, what strange bedfellows indeed’. For all the posturing, for all the positioning, for all the impassioned speeches, I see very little difference in the positions of both sides of this chamber when we look at the foundation principles behind the movement from a scattered, state-based industrial relations system to a national industrial relations system.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rather than to say, ‘A pox on all of you here,’ it is to congratulate everyone here in recognising the movement of business and the union tradition to a future, hopefully, within Australia and the Australian workplace that is one of a united working environment where those foundation pillars are adhered to and supported by both employees and employers. Those foundation pillars represent a national scheme, and for a lot of reasons I hope the term ‘
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                 Work Choices
                </a>
                ’ is one we can put on the shelf for political reasons and for a whole number of reasons. Let us hope the term itself is dead other than being a very important High Court case that recognises the importance of the role of the Commonwealth under the Corporations Law. I hope the move towards a national scheme is supported by both sides of this chamber, with a foundation pillar not only in industrial relations laws but in occupational health and safety laws as well. The range of structures that we currently have in place for businesses, in an increasingly global business environment within Australia today, is an absolute dog’s breakfast.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another foundation pillar is the streamlining of an award structure. Whilst I have feedback from my communities about concerns with the hospitality award and the detail of the streamlining of the hospitality award, fundamentally as a foundation principle the streamlining of an award structure in Australia is something I would have thought both sides of this chamber would have strongly supported. I would have thought support for such a move would be seen in both sets of policies. Whether from a business angle or a union angle, fundamentally having a minimum set of principles in place in a fair work set of rules is something that I would have thought all members of this chamber would support. So, with respect to the 10 commandments from the government of the day, I wear that as a mandate issue. If there is a change of government sometime in the future, by all means I wish them good luck in looking at their own set of principles and their own set of minimum standards. But, fundamentally, those three key principles—moving to a national scheme, streamlining awards and a having set of 10 commandments, if you like, in setting some national minimum principles in the workplace—are all good, solid policy for the future of this country.
               </p>

                I endorse the comment made on a news bulletin this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, where he said the only point of difference was this issue of 15 or 20 employees as a definition of small business. That is what it has come down to.

                  No. I am sure that when dealing with amendments to this legislation you have seen me at different times sitting either with members of the opposition or with members of the government. Mine will be a consistent ‘yes’ position. I will be supporting the amendments from the Senate. I think they did some good, meaty work last night. I actually think they justified their existence—

                   I would not go quite that far. They earned their keep last night in going through the details of a fairly substantive change through a lot of different amendments to the Fair Work Bill. So I will be consistently sitting on that side saying: ‘Let us pass this legislation. Let us bring it together. Let us have a workplace for the future that recognises the traditions of where everyone has come from in this chamber and let us have a country that has a business community that is working and working well.’

                     The Leader of the Opposition calls me stubborn. Stubborn in pursuit of an election mandate; stubborn in pursuit of delivering a promise—well, I’ll take that. I cannot wait to see the bumper stickers from the Liberal Party at the next election: ‘Don’t vote Labor, they’re too stubborn in delivering what they promise to you.’ I cannot wait to see those on the back of every Liberal members’ car at the next election.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yes, we are stubborn in doing what we said we would do because we believe in telling the Australian people the truth. I understand that the concept of telling the Australian people the truth does not resonate with members of the Liberal Party. I understand that they struggle with that, because they did not tell the Australian people the truth about
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                      Work Choices
                     </a>
                     . As recently as 13 December last year, the Leader of the Opposition was saying:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won. So we must respect that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Clearly, if that had been a statement of truth then we would not be having the debate that we are about to have now about Labor’s unfair dismissal laws. So this is the side of the House that is stubborn in telling the truth and stubborn in delivering its election promises, and over there we have promises given and not delivered personally by the Leader of the Opposition as recently as 13 December 2008.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Compared with the carry-on that we have seen from the other side, let us be clear about what the amendments are. We went to the last election and we said that we would bring unfair dismissal laws back to this country so that good workers, if they were unfairly dismissed, had recourse and remedy—something Work Choices basically stripped away for Australian workers. We said we understood that there should be special arrangements for small business and small business should be defined as fewer than 15 employees. Why? Because that is the known definition under the workplace relations law for redundancy and we wanted the system to be simple and the same—special arrangements for small businesses on redundancy and unfair dismissal, same definition. We took that to the election and we are seeking to deliver it, stubborn in pursuit of delivering what we said we would to the Australian people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The reason the argument has boiled down to this is not that the Liberal Party sees some great magic in the number 15 versus the number 20. Indeed, last night in the Senate they were advocating 25. Their position in government was that workers should not have any entitlement to contest their dismissal. The only reason we are debating this here today is that they had to comb through for something that they could get the support of the Independent senators on so that they had something over which to keep twisting and turning and opposing the Fair Work Bill, so that they could stand another day, another 24 hours, in defence of Work Choices. That is all it is about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Then the Liberal Party moved two other very silly amendments in the Senate as part of this twisting and turning in defence of Work Choices. It made a nonsensical change to the objects of the act. In a bill that talks about enterprise level bargaining throughout, for whatever reason they thought they would change it to ‘enterprise level or workplace’—a change that does not make any sense, and we are rejecting it. And then, in their desperation in the Senate, unbelievably, the Liberal Party moved to strip out of this bill protections for independent contractors from being discriminated against because they are not members of unions. This is what the Liberal Party moved to take out of this bill, to strip the words ‘independent contractor’ out so that all freedom of association provisions for independent contractors would be gone. We will not stand for those kinds of silly amendments and we are rejecting one of their independent contractor amendments through this motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     All this is about, all it has ever been about and all it ever will be about is that this side of the House believes in fairness and decency at work and the Liberal Party does not. This side of the House fought Work Choices and we always will.

                     <p>
                      This is all about jobs. Right across Australia today there are thousands of small businesses struggling with a slowing economy and rising unemployment. They are concerned about how they will be able to maintain people on their payroll. They are focused on jobs. Thousands of those small businesses are in the state of Queensland, and they are weighing up the rising risk of a Rudd recession. They are looking at all of the policies of this government, each and every one of them, and measuring their effect against the results. We know what the results have been: they have been slowing economic growth and growth going into reverse, with the likelihood that the March quarter will be negative too and we will in every sense be in a recession with rising unemployment. That is what Australia’s small businesses are about, and nowhere more so than in Queensland, because nowhere more so than in Queensland do we have small businesses built around the hospitality industry.

                     <p>
                      Let’s look to see what industry is actually saying. What are the retailers saying? The Australian Retailers Association welcomed the vote last night because they recognise the change that was made to the definition of ‘small business’ for this purpose to 20 full-time equivalents was good for jobs. They made the point that:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Without this redefinition of small business, unfair dismissal laws in the Government’s Fair Work Bill will destroy small business confidence to employ staff and we cannot afford this in the current economic climate.

                     <p>

                      has been quoted extensively by the government lately, so I am sure that they will be very interested to listen to what ACCI has had to say about jobs, which is the real issue. They have said about the change that we supported in the Senate early this morning:
                     </p>

                      The change is necessary because the employment mix in small business has changed over the years, and past unfair dismissal laws dented the confidence of small businesses to employ permanent staff. Especially now, business confidence is crucial to jobs, and small business is the jobs engine of the economy.

                     <p>
                      So these two representative organisations, both representing small businesses, both representing businesses that are particularly vulnerable to these laws, are calling for the government to be reasonable and to do what we did all the time in government and accept Senate amendments. We recognised that this is a parliament of two houses, and we recognised changes imposed on many occasions by the Senate.
