        Today is 22 years since an act of terrorism shook the world and changed the world forever: 2,977 lives were lost in this atrocity in

        </a>
        , Virginia and Pennsylvania. Ten Australians were amongst those who lost their lives that day, and today we honour their memory. Our thoughts go to all of their family and friends. Some of course were known to people in this House due to their past professions and relationships, so today will be a difficult day. It's a day as well where the democratic world and all those who uphold human rights and human decency reassert our commitment to continue to fight the scourge of terrorism, to remain vigilant and to make sure that we do so for this and for future generations.

         We join with the Prime Minister in marking this anniversary. We think of those families, the first responders and others who still live with the loss and in many cases, psychologically if not physically as well, have not recovered from those treacherous events. It's changed the world. It's changed the way in which we travel and we operate. It's changed the world in many ways. All of us can recall those dark scenes as they came across our television screens, and people were watching in disbelief. I pay tribute to all of those in our country and in the United States, with our other allies, who have worked hard day and night—intelligence agencies and security agencies—to keep us safe and to prevent another similar tragedy of that scale from having taken place. It's no small achievement that we live in relative peace in this country, and I hope and pray that it always may be the case. But we should never forget those who sacrificed themselves to keep us in that position. It's something worth honouring as we commemorate the very significant loss that the United States suffered 22 years ago.
