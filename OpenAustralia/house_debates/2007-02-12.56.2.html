       <p>
        My office has been advised by the bills and papers office staff that government regulations are no longer to be provided in print form or that the process is being phased out with the intention of government regulations being available electronically only. I ask if, as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presiding_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Presiding Officer
        </a>
        of this House, you could look at what policy has been put in placeâ€”what process was involved and what consultations occurred. I understand that they are available electronically, but there would be many members and senators, and I am sure people in the public generally, who look to those written documents to work from. The regulations are in fact important in the governance of the country. They represent the law of the land. They are important documents and, if indeed that advice is correct and the intention is for them not to be available in hard-copy form, I think there would be a number of members who would have concerns about that. I would appreciate your advice on the matter.

        <p>
         I thank the member for Brisbane. I certainly endorse his remarks about the importance of the availability of government regulations. I will make further inquiries on the specifics of the matters he has raised and report back.
