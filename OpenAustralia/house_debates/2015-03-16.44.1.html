        It is currently country show season across Eden-Monaro. In all, there will be 12 shows. In recent weeks, I have attended the Cobargo, Delegate, Dalgety, Cooma and Bemboka shows. All shows have shown that the Australian bush is alive and prospering. The produce displayed in these shows has been of a first-class quality, but even more so have been the display of sheep and cattle. Indeed, we have some of the finest examples of both in the world. Industry participants tell me that the Monaro has more sheep than the whole of Queensland combined and I would not be prepared to second-guess them on this.

        In the recent Cobargo Show, I was happy to talk to Ray Sawtell at length about farming in this region and also about the strength of the agricultural show society. He is the regional district representative and been a fixture at shows in the region for many years. He said that the recent shows have been some of the best he has seen in those years. At the Delegate Show, I spoke to Bombala's mayor,

        . I commend him and the local community for the best little show in the district.

        At Dalgety, I was pleased to speak to Mayor John Cahill, former mayor

        , local businessman Ian Ware and Howard Charles of Nimmitabel. Dalgety is a terrific country show. It was a great turnout of over 3,000, who were treated to some of very impressive displays, especially the working dogs. Cooma and Bombala shows were also strong events. At Cooma, I had the benefit of a long chat to Michael Litchfield and local mayor Dean Lynch.
