        I have spoken in this House before of the late Cliff Dohle, a former constituent of mine and Vietnam veteran. I first spoke in this House in 2006, when I called for a re-examination of the Long Tan medals issue. Cliff was one of the great heroes of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        . He was a helicopter pilot who risked his life, defied orders and replenished the Australian troops in the middle of that battle. Without his action, the story of Long Tan would be a very different one today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cliff died in February this year. This week the government announced that it was accepting a recommendation of its new tribunal to award Cliff the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Service Medal
        </a>
        , the contemporary equivalent award of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Flying Cross
        </a>
        , the original award for which he was recommended in 1966.
       </p>

        Cliff Dohle is one of the great stories in history for Australia in the Vietnam conflict. It has been a difficult period in history for all of those who fought in the Battle of Long Tan. Today I wish to confine my remarks to Cliffâ€™s role. I got to know Cliff very well. He was very keen to see this issue resolved. I know he would be very happy with the outcome for himself, but of course he would be very concerned about the outcome for all people who were in the Battle of Long Tan. That was a pivotal battle and it is the battle after which Vietnam Veterans Day is named.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cliff was one of the quiet heroes that you so often see. He lived a quiet life in Lilydale. His wife, whom I spoke to yesterday, was very happy with the result. It gives the Dohle family some closure on the issue and it closes a chapter that has been open for a long time. He served this nation with distinction. He was very proud to serve this nation. The Australian nation needs to celebrate the contribution of Cliff Dohle and that entire generation who fought in Vietnam on our behalf and who endured such difficulty on their return.
