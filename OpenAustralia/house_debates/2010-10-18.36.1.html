       <p>
        I would like to mention Kingsway Christian College today. During the election campaign I had the honour of attending a couple of sessions with their senior students to talk about their responsibilities as potential college captains and deputy college captains. I was fortunate enough to hear them make a number of speeches that I could give them a little bit of feedback on. They then made speeches to the whole school and four students were voted into the highest positions. I would just like to mention that the college captains for 2011 are Tarbie van Tonder and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Jones
        </a>
        , and the vice-captains are Kelsey Hall and Ross Conradie. I know Tim and Annette Jones, who are Paul Jonesâ€™ parents. I know them from church and I am sure that they are very proud, as are all the parents of the Kingsway Christian College captains and vice-captains. That school is a very positive organisation. They do great things in education and within the community. So I wish the 2011 college captains and vice-captains all the best for their terms next year.
