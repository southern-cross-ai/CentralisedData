       <p>
        Job creation and job security is my priority and it is certainly the priority of this government. We know that to create jobs and to protect the ones that we already have it is often the case that government needs to get out of the way of business and allow them to do what they do best—that is, to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Destructively, unions take a very different approach to business—and often at the expense of workers, their families and the local economy. This is certainly the case presently with Simplot—one of the largest employers on the north-west coast of Tasmania , which is at a critical juncture in the future of its Devonport processing plant.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a time when this company has been honest and upfront in publically stating its difficulty in ensuring its Devonport plant remains financially viable, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
         AMWU
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETU" rel="nofollow">
         ETU
        </a>
        have launched an extraordinary campaign against Simplot and the majority of workers. Despite a slowing in wage growth throughout the country and example after example of businesses closing the ir doors due to the wage inflation and outrageous uni on demands, the unions have rejected Simplot's pay offer and opted for industrial action.
       </p>
       <p>
        The most extraordinary part of this union campaign is its lack of support , I believe, among st the workforce. Out of a total workforce of 891 , only 575 are paid- up members of the AMWU and the ETU. But, interestingly, o f that membership of 575 , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
         AEC
        </a>
        reports that only 388 ballot papers were counted. Yet, the union organiser declares that everybody is livid—absolutely livid—about the company's offer to them. But only 388 of 575 of 891 workers, in fact, took the time to fill in a ballot paper. That is 67.5 per cent of the union membership but only 43 per cent of the total workforce. Further, up to 84 union members of the 388 voted against some form of industrial action , meaning that only 34 per cent of the total workf orce supports industrial action that could, in fact, eventually lead to the closure of this plant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despit e only having the support of 34 per cent of the workforce, the unions have taken it upon themselves to put 100 per cent of the jobs in Devonport, in particular, on the line. That is why I took the unusual step a few weeks ago to publish an open letter in the local paper t o all Simplot employees on the north-west c oast , imploring them to reject industrial action and to work with Simplot in order to protect their jobs, the financial security of their families , the farmers and the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This current negotiation is not about the power and influence of unions ; nor is it about a multinational company trying to take advantage of its workers. It is about the long-term viability of a very strategic business in the vegetable food chain of our region. I make this plea again tonight in this parliament: c ease , please, you r industrial action immediately; sit down with Simplot and find a solution to this dispute . The north-west coast, my electorate of Braddon, cannot afford Simplot to go the way of the paper mill, the carpet factory, the weaving mill or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCain" rel="nofollow">
         McCain
        </a>
        . That would be a terrible but wholly avoidable disaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Simplot has been working diligently to implement its plan for a sustainable future for its Devonport processing plant and has commenced a significant investment program that will ensure it remains competitive in an extremely fierce global market.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take my responsibility as the local federal representative for Braddon very seriously. It is my responsibility to do everything I can to protect the local jobs. We currently have local jobs and I want to keep local jobs. I want to help build the economic and regulatory environment that will encourage existing and new businesses to employ more people. That is what this government is about. I make no apology for standing up for the entire Simplot workforce, their families, local farmers and the local economy. I am calling on the unions to immediately cease its job-destroying campaign against industry in the north west.
       </p>
       <p>
        I respect the workers at Simplot. They do a great job, many of them skilled in the areas that they work. But they currently earn above normal award wages and their conditions are definitely not from the last century. There is a truism that we all know: a good day's work for a good day's pay. It is certainly true, but it is very hard to have a good day's work and earn a good day's pay if you do not have a job.
