         Edmondson Park
        </a>
        is one of Sydney's fastest-growing suburbs. On 1 July I was pleased to attend the blessing and opening of the Saint Francis Catholic College buildings which house the multipurpose hall and the technology, science, creative and performing arts, and general learning classrooms. These growing suburbs and the students living there deserve infrastructure to support their education. I applaud the foresight of the Wollongong dioceses for their planning, with the decision made in 2015 to build a school at Edmondson Park.

        It is also important that the

        government catches up and provides a high school to offer students living in Edmondson Park an education close to home, especially for those who are currently travelling long distances to overcrowded schools. New suburbs deserve facilities to be available as soon as people move in. Saint Francis Catholic College started on a temporary site in 2017 with 178 kinder to year 7 students and 32 teachers and support staff. The school now boasts a student population of 1,250 and over 125 staff. The opening was performed by the Most Reverend Brian Mascord, bishop of the Wollongong dioceses, with an address by the current and founding principal, Mr Simon Abernethy. I was so impressed by the facilities and would like to thank them for their hospitality.
