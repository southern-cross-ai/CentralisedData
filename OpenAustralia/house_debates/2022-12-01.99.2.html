       <p>
        Before everyone leaves, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for a big year. It's true to say that election years are enormous years for everyone. I want to thank, first of all, the staff of the Department of the House of Representatives, led by the extraordinary diligent clerk, Claressa Surtees. Your hard work in keeping the chamber running has not gone unnoticed, particularly by me, and your procedural expertise is, as usual, impeccable. To the chamber attendants, staff supporting committees, the Serjeant-at-Arms, finance, people strategies, communications and support staff: I thank you all on behalf of members for your hard work this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge a very longstanding departmental employee who has recently retired. Many of you would know Rod Carn, who supported this parliament, both the old and the new, for more than 40 years. Rod worked in security and member services and is now understandably missed by his colleagues, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Rod for his service.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services we say a huge thankyou. The show could not go on without the work of the amazing cleaners, security, building support, and the chefs, waitstaff and everyone in between who keep us well fed and caffeinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my fellow members and your hardworking staff: it's been an absolute pleasure and privilege working alongside you this year, particularly the new members, the class of 2022, and the largest crossbench ever elected since federation. I have had the pleasure of getting to know you all. I thank you for all your support in my role as Speaker. There's no handbook on how to be Speaker, but you've shown me incredible kindness and patience.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Deputy Speaker and my friend the member for Newcastle, Sharon Claydon: you have been a tremendous support to me this year, and I've thoroughly enjoyed working with you in support of this chamber over a cuppa every morning before we start work. You are a warrior in this chamber for so many people.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Second Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Moore, I thank you for your sage advice and wonderful support to the Speaker's panel. You've stepped up to assist the running of these chambers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank the Prime Minister. Your support for my speakership has meant a lot as I settle into this new role, an important role. I hope you get to enjoy some time off with Jodie, Nathan and Toto, and better luck next year with the Rabbitohs.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Dickson, you've been a strong leader in your party this year, and I hope you, Kirilly and the kids enjoy a happy Christmas together and we get the hot Queensland summer that we know and love, except for all the rain.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Leader of the Nationals, my fellow classmate in the class of 2016, thank you for being so quiet during question time and being a top bloke, sometimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Leader of the House deserves a big break. Your quick work in the chamber has kept us all on our toes, me included. Your friendship and leadership are appreciated by many across the political spectrum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, to the Manager of Opposition Business and the member for Bradfield, the wonderful thing about this House is that we can be debating points of order furiously one moment and catching up for a cup of coffee right after. I've very much enjoyed getting to know you, and I appreciate your professionalism and leadership in your new role, which I now appreciate is the second-hardest job in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a privilege being your Speaker, and I wish you all and your families a very happy and safe Christmas.
       </p>
