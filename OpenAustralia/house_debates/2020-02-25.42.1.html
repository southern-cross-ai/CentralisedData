        My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the Morrison-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">

He was there, alongside them, supporting them, putting his arms around them, making sure whatever federal assistance that he could offer, that we could offer as a government, was provided. I thank him, on behalf of the parliament, for the dutiful work that he did, like so many members right across the parliament, to help our fire-stricken residents. Last Sunday, in Sydney—

         We will build back better. The member for Lyne knows that. That's why we've established an initial outlay of $2 billion that's gone to the National Bushfire Recovery Agency. It's headed by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin, who's doing a very, very good job making sure that he's out in the communities. Whether it's

         of New South Wales, Batlow, Tumbarumba, the east Gippsland area or Mallacoota, he's out there. He's making sure that people know that we will build back better. We're there for the here and now. We're there for the weeks and months, indeed, years ahead, to help rebuild those communities, rebuild and restore those towns and villages.

         is a very resilient area. I was at Geraldton late last week talking to the tourism operators, and talking to the cray fishers and lobster fishers about the coronavirus and the effects it's having on their industry, given the fact that with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Lunar_New_Year" rel="nofollow">

         they've lost their markets, they've lost their exports to be able to reap the rewards of their harvest. Unfortunately that opportunity for them this season is lost. Dave Towers, a 40-year veteran, said he was thankful for what the government's doing as far as the $76 million tourism outlay for both domestic and international tourists but realises that, for them, the coronavirus is taking its toll. Regional Australia is heavily impacted by fires, by floods and by the coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked about alternatives. The alternative is the zero net emissions target that Labor wants to take us down. That will particularly affect regional Australia. It will hurt farmers. It will hurt the transport sector. It will hurt those people who call regional Australia home.
