        (—) (): Well, it's been a big month of sport in my electorate of Brand, particularly for the Rockingham Rams Football and Netball Club. Last weekend I watched the Rams take on the Pinjarra Tigers at the women's Peel football league grand final at

        . It was great to see that some of the young women playing were in the first girls team that I sponsored when I was first elected back in 2016. This is the jumper that they get to wear. They love it, and I love it. It's been awesome to see how some of the young women, like Kalani Ingram, Aiesha Ugle Woods, Amber Henn, Gabbi Collica, Ella Bailey and Dakota Dal Bello, have developed their skills and commitment to the game and their team over the last six seasons. They've come a long way, and it's really been great fun and a great honour to witness.
       </p>
       <p>
        The game was hard fought by both sides, with the Tigers eventually clawing their way to a four-point win. To the team themselves, I congratulate you all on reaching the big game. I know losing a grand final hurts—goodness knows I've lost a few of them playing hockey—but you should be so proud of your efforts on the day and over the course of the season. I know it will not be your final grand final. I also want to congratulate other parts of the club, the men's Colts for making their grand final, and of course the reserves team, who are the 2022 premiers after defeating South Mandurah 52-54 in a clearly very close game.
       </p>

        On the netball side of the club, in August the Rams took home three premierships in the Peel netball league, with the reserves, league 3 and the under-23 team all winning their grand finals. Congratulations to all the teams, all the players, all the volunteers, all the parents, all the coaches—everyone that helps. Results like this for the footy and netball club only come about with the dedication and hard work from all the players, the supporters and the coaching teams.

        The Rockingham Rams should be extremely proud of the community culture they have developed over the years. It's clubs like the Rams that cultivate champions like Aaron Naughton at the

I want to congratulate the Rockingham Rams on a stellar year of results in football and netball. I'm looking forward to attending the club's 75th anniversary on 1 October and celebrating with you all.

        , President of the Rockingham Rams Football and Netball Club, who first got me involved after I was elected in 2016. He's been a committed president of the club. He's done a great deal for the community that is the club. I understand he might not be continuing as president, because he wants to give someone else a go. To you, Michael, congratulations and thanks so much for being so welcoming to me.
