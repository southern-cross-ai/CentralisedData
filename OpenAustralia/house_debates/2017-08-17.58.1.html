        in my electorate. I wanted to give a parliamentary shout-out to that great school today, because on Wednesday I will be going along to

        </a>
        to watch them play in the grand final of the Queensland schoolboys competition against Keebra Park. I want to congratulate my mate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Peach" rel="nofollow">

        , the principal of that school, and also the coach Joe O'Callaghan and the players and all the students, who have been doing such a terrific job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wanted to alert the House to something even more special which is happening at Marsden State High School, and that is a program called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTC" rel="nofollow">
         MTC
        </a>
        , which stands for Mates Talk Change. It is a mental health program that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League
        </a>
        guys started but all the students participate in. It is led by Megan Mulcahy, a really inspirational teacher. The kids get together and they talk about their mental health and they raise awareness. They have a slogan, which is, 'It ain't weak to speak.' It ain't weak to speak about your mental health. It is fantastic. It's a great thing that they do. On Wednesday they will win the Queensland schoolboys comp. I am prepared to say here that they will win. But, even if they don't, even if by a freak of nature this amazing open boys team does not win on Wednesday against Keebra Park, the Mates Talk Change program will stand as a real tribute to a great school in the best local rugby league community on the planet.
