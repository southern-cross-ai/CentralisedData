        and Don Earl. They were all national servicemen. These well-known Australians were part of our armed forces because national service was drawn from the entire community, which resulted in many servicemen rising to high positions in business, the professions and the community. Apart from these high-profile names, there were thousands of young men from across Australia called to serve and, just as our soldiers of earlier days were affectionately known as diggers, the national servicemen were later to be colloquially referred to as nashos.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such nasho is Don Earl. Don is married to Betty and lives in Korumburra in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         South Gippsland
        </a>
        . Don joined national service in 1951 and was among the first intake. At the time there were only 36,000 Australians in uniform and 1,700 of them were officers. With all the trouble in the Pacific it was decided that our defence was inadequate. That is when the government said, 'If you are 18, you have got to do national service.' Between 1965 and 1972 things changed and a total of 63,735 men were selected by a birthday ballot for the Army.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years Don Earl has served his local community. One of his great loves is the Korumburra-Bena football club. Don coached Korumburra for four years, and is a life member and former president of the Bass Valley Football Association. However, as a former national serviceman, Don found himself offering to help start up a sub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association in Korumburra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, in a surprise ceremony, Don Earl was presented with the Gordon Murphy Award for outstanding achievement by the Victorian branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia. This is the highest honour available to an individual national serviceman in Victoria. What sets this award aside and makes it even more unique is that, from a membership of thousands, only one person a year is presented with the award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don has served with the local sub-branch for over 13 years. He has served 10 years as president, 13 as welfare officer and has been state delegate for 12 years. Don has also cared for many nashos who were not in good health and he has conducted special funeral services for many of those servicemen. When asked about the award Don said that it was more about his mates and the service they gave to Australia than about his own contribution. 'They are the heart and soul behind this honour,' said Don. Don was presented with his award at the annual meeting of the South Gippsland sub-branch at the Inverloch
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . This was a complete surprise to Don and was topped off when Mr Rick Murphy, son of the late Gordon Murphy, one of the founders of the association in Victoria, arrived to present the award to him personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gordon Murphy Award also recognises the work of Don's wife, Betty, who has actively supported her husband in many of his projects and stood by him unstintingly over many years. When asked about the award Don replied, 'Apart from marrying Betty, it's the greatest honour that I've ever had.' The sub-branch continues to flourish in Korumburra and now has up to 60 members at meetings who follow the motto 'sharing and caring'. It has always been known that there is a special bond between those who wear the uniform, and this is particularly true for our national servicemen.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        there was a great deal of derision and domestic divisions. This saw national servicemen, particularly those who had had active service, in the invidious position of being not only conscripted by a selected ballot but also subjected to derision by some of the Australian public. The personal contact with those men, who to this day still suffer from the experience, has caused Don, whilst juggling many other jobs, to take on the role of welfare officer, which occasionally included conducting special funeral services, as I said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Betty had the last word. She said that for weeks before the award presentation she was answering the phone with a 'yes', or a 'no' or a 'maybe'. The surprise had to be kept at all costs. Then, as the family and special guests arrived at Inverloch, the annual meeting went from 40 to 73 people, and Don was speechless. 'That's the first time I've ever seen him speechless,' said Betty, 'and, as well as that, he was a big sook.' Don admitted to a tear or two.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don: it helps to have the amazing, interesting and engaging personality that you have. You are a remarkable man. You have done great work. I first met you as an administrator in the football area. You have done us proud. We are so proud of you, Don Earl.
