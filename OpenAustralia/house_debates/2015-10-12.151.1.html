        I would like to share with the House a forum dealing with domestic violence that I held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannering_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Mannering Park
        </a>
        in Shortland electorate. It was a morning where we had a number of guest speakers and where the issue of domestic violence was raised. At the morning tea, there were a number of members from the community and a number of organisations that provide services for people who are victims of domestic violence. It was horrific to hear the stories that were shared by many of the women, but it was heartening to hear the support being provided by organisers within the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was very sad to hear that there is a lack of support, that funds have been removed from services that provided vital support for women who are trying to leave a situation of domestic violence, that there is insufficient housing and support available, and that funding had been slashed. This morning tea and forum was run in conjunction with the Mannering Park
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        , who declared September their month for supporting people living within domestic violence situations. It was a time when people talked about all the structures and organisations that they have in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the principal of Mannering Park Public School for turning up on the day. It was school holidays, and he took time out of his holidays to come along and join with the people who were present at that forum. The strong message that came out of the forum was that the people of Mannering Park and surrounding areas say no to domestic violence. They call on the government for action. They were pleased with the statement that the Prime Minister made the day before, but they felt it did not go far enough. Many more resources need to be put into dealing with domestic violence. On Saturday, 31 October, I will be joining the CWA and support services, including

        women's services and Coast Shelter, when we go along to the Mannering Park Public School fete. I think that all members of this House would say no to domestic violence.
