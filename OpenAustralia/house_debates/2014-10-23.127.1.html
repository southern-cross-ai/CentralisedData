        Last month a new memorial wall dedicated to Australian service nurses was officially unveiled in Bundaberg by Governor of Queensland Paul de Jersey. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend due to duties in Canberra, but my wife, Allison, and daughter Ruby attended on my behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dedication ceremony was held to coincide with the 100th anniversary of when the first contingent of Army nursing sisters departed Queensland for

        . The memorial park is the first of its kind in Australia. Only

       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was also very fortunate to attend a very moving dedication ceremony at

        veteran and a well-known local businessman, who made a substantial donation towards to the memorial. The event was also attended by Senator James McGrath.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government contributed $50,000 towards the expansion of the Freedom Park war memorial in Hervey Bay, under the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The Hervey Bay RSL sub-branch has used the funds to help purchase a bronze statue of a light horseman. I must say that it is an absolutely fabulous memorial. The light horseman in full charge over the parapet, sword in hand, is something to behold.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dedication was conducted by three chaplains but I would like to make special mention of the RSL chaplain Vic Burgess. In the time remaining, I would like to put into

        part of his requiem for the day, which is made up from a range of different areas, including the light horse poems. He read:
       </p>
       <p>
        Amen.
