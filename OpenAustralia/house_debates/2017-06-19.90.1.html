        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister outline to the House the importance of affordable and reliable energy for Australian exporters, particularly small businesses? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches to energy that would threaten Australian jobs?

         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
          O'Connor
         </a>
         for his question. The coalition, of course, has a very strong track record when it comes to delivering a trifecta of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          North Asia
         </a>
         powerhouse agreements, which are giving Aussie exporters, many of them small- and medium-sized businesses, globally preferential market access, which is helping to drive economic growth and helping to ensure that we are also driving jobs. Indeed, in the member for O'Connor's own electorate, we have seen businesses like the Avocado Export Company, Esperance Abalone Enterprise and Chatsfield Wines taking advantage of this unmatched preferential access to some of the world's largest consumer markets to be able to grow their businesses and drive investment into their businesses, and, as a consequence, are able to improve job opportunities for Australians in the member for O'Connor's electorate—and not just his, but many exporting electorates across this great country. That is a consequence of the agreements that the coalition has been able to put in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         A crucial ingredient to being able to ensure that we maximise the opportunity in terms of these export markets is affordable and reliable energy. We have to know that our exporters have access to affordable and stable energy supply in order to make the most of these opportunities. Many of these businesses, as I mentioned, are taking advantage of these free trade agreements, and they are small- and medium-sized businesses. Indeed, in their submission to the Finkel report, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Chamber of Commerce and Industry
         </a>
         in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         noted how electricity cost increases erode Australia's business market competitiveness. That is a principle that we understand. This side of the House fundamentally understands that they must have stability and certainty of supply and that without it—as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents many small and medium businesses, noted—their business competitiveness goes backwards. That is why this side of the House is focused on the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, to ensure that there is security of gas supply to meet the needs of Australian consumers first. This side of the House will make sure that we remain committed to stable and affordable energy.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is very different to that side of the House. I heard about alternative policies—well, there are. We see the ideology that is driven by the Leader of the Opposition—an approach that sees him more concerned about addressing the concerns of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Left" rel="nofollow">
          Labor Left
         </a>
         than he is about what is best for Australian consumers; more concerned with the politics of energy policy than he is about what a good energy price is; and more concerned about holding in abeyance the member for Grayndler than he is about what is good for Australian small- and medium-sized businesses. The simple fact is that, when it comes to 'Red Bill', this guy does not have wings. This guy is more about fizz and a lack of substance than he is about a better, more affordable and more secure energy supply for Australian small and medium businesses.
