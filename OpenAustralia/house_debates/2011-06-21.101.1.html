            Let me just run through them: the tax increase on company cars, which is set to raise $970 million over the forward estimates; the abolishment of the entrepreneurs tax offset, announced on 10 May, which is expected to raise $365 million over the forward estimates; the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset, which is expected to raise $755 million over the forward estimates; the disallowing of deductions against government assistance payments, removing minors' eligibility for the low-income tax offset on unearned income; the deferral of tax breaks for green buildings, which will raise $295 million. It is 19 new taxes since you guys came to office. You have put your hands into the pockets or opened the purse strings of the mums and dads and the businesses of this nation—

            Yell all you want from the other side of the House, but you will not drown out the voice of the Australian people! You are a joke when it comes to this. We have had a wave of taxes from this government. The death of fiscal responsibility is at your hands. For the first time in nine years, the people of Australia have not been given any type of tax relief or tax cuts. There is no relief. You guys make the point that you are a low-taxing government, but go through and calculate how much you guys are taxing. If you had put the carbon tax into your forward estimates or in your budget, you would have been the greatest-taxing government in the history of Australia. That would have superseded anything that we ever did.

            Earlier this week, I sent out a note to the media saying that, as a nation, we were mourning because we have been dying economically since the Prime Minister knifed the member for Griffith and took over the purse strings of this nation. Not only are you guys struggling with reference to taxation; you are struggling with who is going to be your next leader. In the absence of a standout candidate—I hear it in the corridors: 'Is it going to be

              Of course, Mr Speaker, but the room understands the point that I am trying to make. These guys need to celebrate the fact that their polling is still in double figures. I do not think we can expect to see those for too long.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the 24th, I encourage all of my colleagues and the nation to dress in black to mourn the death of fiscal responsibility since this government came to office. Only a coalition government will stand for the principles of less tax, less government and no wasteful spending. This government is more about hypocrisy than democracy. How else do you explain why we will not have a plebiscite on the issue of a carbon tax—a people's vote which would cost about $80 million?

              We would not have the expense of that $80 million if you guys had got it right the first time. You guys must just roll over in your beds each night regretting the fact that the Prime Minister, six days before the election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That is your Achilles heel. Surely $80 million will be seen as an investment in our nature's future and democracy when Australia risks losing as much of its gross domestic product.

              Mr Speaker, the activities of the parliament tonight are not something that I am proud of. I hope we shift away from this disgraceful behaviour, but I can assure you that, as I said earlier, irrespective of how loud and how hard the government try and drown out my voice, they will never drown out the voice of the silent majority of my nation.
