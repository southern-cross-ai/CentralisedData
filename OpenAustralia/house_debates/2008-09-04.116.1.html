        I would like to draw the House’s attention to the potential loss of a valuable radio broadcasting asset in my electorate of Bendigo. The new government has adopted the policy of its predecessor to extend the ABC’s

         Australian Communications and Media Authority
        </a>
        has identified an

         FM
        </a>
        frequency that has carried community broadcasting for some 26 years as being the most suitable one for NewsRadio in Bendigo. Community broadcasting is founded on principles of accessibility, diversity, independence and localism. These are an essential part of the sector’s code of practice, which is registered with the

        I am a great admirer of the NewsRadio service. Its news coverage is excellent and, of course, it brings the proceedings of this parliament to many people who would not otherwise be able to hear the words of profound wisdom that are spoken here and in the Senate—well, sometimes. As federal parliament is usually in session for around 18 weeks per year, the other 34 weeks are for broadcasting national and international news. But, despite all that, no-one can claim that NewsRadio carries local content, nor does it offer the accessibility of community radio.
       </p>
       <p>
        The replacement of a community radio station in Bendigo by NewsRadio would mean the loss of a valuable community asset that serves the needs of many of my constituents. Research on behalf of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia in 2006 showed that one-quarter of all Australians aged over 15, or more than four million people, listen to community radio in a typical week. People who listen to community radio do so for an average of 7½ hours each week, and listeners aged over 55 tune in for almost 10½ hours per week. Their main reason for listening to community radio, particularly in non-metropolitan areas, is its local content. Research by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        in 2007 found that listeners also find community radio accessible and approachable. They like the laid-back presentation style by ‘ordinary people’. They like the diversity of programming, particularly as to local news and information, that cannot be found on other broadcast media.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has one of the highest concentrations of media ownership in the world, a situation made worse by the changes to the media ownership laws by the previous government. In the commercial radio sector, this has led to a reduction in local content and an increase in syndicated programming in order to cut costs.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        has not been immune either, as its funding has been slashed in real terms over the past decade. My local ABC station in central Victoria is only manned during daylight hours Monday to Friday and carries network programs at other times. In contrast, most community radio stations are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making them unique in regional centres. The practical advantage of this was widely demonstrated in 2003, when certain suburbs of Bendigo were struck by a freak storm. In a seven-kilometre trail of destruction, 10 homes were completely destroyed and another 90 suffered damage. Local community stations were broadcasting news of the events soon after it happened, but it was five hours before a commercial broadcaster mentioned it and even the ABC had no ability to report locally and it was two hours before the incident was mentioned on its national news bulletin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sport is a part of Australian culture and local sport is particularly important in rural and regional communities. Local football and netball clubs are a significant part of a community’s social life. They bring an important benefit during times of adversity, such as the drought that many regions, including my own constituency, have been suffering for a decade or so. Sport not only offers exercise and enjoyment; it also allows some respite from the harsh realities of life on a water starved farm or running a depressed rural business. The community radio frequency in Bendigo that has been earmarked for the ABC’s use is the only one that carries local sport broadcasting. Our commercial stations do not cover local sport, the local ABC does not cover it and NewsRadio certainly will not if it is allocated this frequency. In the light of these considerations, it is vital that there is no reduction of community radio broadcasting in Bendigo. I will continue to work with ACMA and the government to find alternative solutions so that my constituents can also have access to the ABC’s NewsRadio service while retaining their excellent community radio frequency of 89.5.
