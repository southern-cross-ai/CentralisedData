        Ageing in our population is something that we can all be proud of because, amongst other things, it points to the successes of increasing life expectancy. Over the past weeks, I have had the pleasure to celebrate some major milestones with some of Dobell's amazing seniors. Last week, I was fortunate to visit the homes of two Dobell couples celebrating significant wedding anniversaries: Mr and Mrs Edward and Gladys Moore of Lisarow, who celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, and Mr and Mrs Bruce and Felicity Pyke,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        s, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only were Edward and Gladys celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary, they were also celebrating their 90th birthdays, in March and January respectively. Both born in 1926, a couple of years before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        , they were childhood sweethearts, marrying just after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . The tales they related of their younger years were just as vivid as if they had happened yesterday. We discussed the many changes in the world and life in general that they had experienced over the course of their marriage and the challenges that they have endured together. I sat, enthralled, and listened to their stories of how they met and fell in love, and how they grew their family, and chose to live on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        These stories were then continued when I made the visit to congratulate Mr and Mrs Bruce and Felicity Pyke, both OAMs, from The Entrance. Unfortunately, Felicity is not well at the moment, but I was so impressed with her charity work and her contribution to Wrap with Love, of which she recently stepped down from the position of Central Coast convener. Wrap with Love provides knitted wraps and blankets to ward off hypothermia in cold countries where people are struggling to stay warm. Bruce and Felicity received Order of Australia medals for their outstanding service to the Wrap with Love organisation, as well as to the wider Central Coast community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both couples are still living in their homes and are actively contributing to our community.

        Last Saturday, I was honoured to attend the 100th birthday of Tom Picot, OAM, a Central Coast icon and one of our most cherished residents. Tom, a World War

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Tom is also the subject of artist Wayne Dowsent, who is entering a portrait of Tom in this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Prize" rel="nofollow">
         Archibald Prize
        </a>
        . This is an amazing portrait and I wish Wayne all the very best with his entry. The secret to Tom's longevity is: a drop of rum every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spending time with these amazing seniors and joining in with them in their anniversary and birthday celebrations gave me much more appreciation of the contribution that our seniors make to our community. It is something each and every one of us should value. I would like to wish everyone who is celebrating a milestone anniversary or birthday such as these: happy anniversary, happy birthday and congratulations!
