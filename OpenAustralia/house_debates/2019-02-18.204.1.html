       <p>
        I stand in this place today to fight for a fair share for the people of Townsville. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government is refusing to give some people in Townsville their fair share. More than 22,000 homes have been flooded and, instead of trying to help the people of Townsville during our worst-ever natural disaster, the LNP have instead placed harsh and stringent restrictions on people trying to access disaster recovery funding. Townsville is being denied its fair share when we need it the most by this out-of-touch and selfish LNP government. There are people like Kevin of Rosslea. Kevin lives in a high-set Queenslander house. Water came through his bottom floor. His hot water system was completely damaged. He has lost his fridge, freezer and numerous other belongings on the bottom floor. Kevin has also gone nine days without power. He thought the worst was behind him but instead the LNP government is refusing to give Kevin the disaster relief assistance money that he desperately needs and that he is most certainly eligible to receive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kevin has been told to give more information due to the underneath of his house not being enclosed. The LNP government are ignoring thousands of people like Kevin and are refusing to give Townsville our fair share. I call on the LNP government to lift the harsh and stringent restrictions and deliver immediate assistance to Townsville residents and stop holding us hostage. If water has been in your property and you have lost your belongings, you should receive this money for support.
