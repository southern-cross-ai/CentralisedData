       </p>
       <p>
        This week it is the 42nd Anniversary of the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Malaysia" rel="nofollow">
         Federation of Malaysia
        </a>
        . This important day was 16 September 1963. Although this date is about the origins and success of the people of Malaysia—and I congratulate them for this important day on Wednesday—I raise this as a motion here in the Australian parliament because of our nation's role in the events at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         The Federation
        </a>
        of Malaysia does actually have specific significance for our nation, because the survival of the Federation of Malaysia was a cause worth fighting for and, in some cases, a cause that Australians died for. I speak of a little known war, the conflict known as the confrontation or konfrontasi. This was when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        , Army and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        joined with Malaysian and Commonwealth forces to oppose Indonesian-sponsored insurgents on Borneo, but also in the sea between Borneo and on the Malaysian peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was in January 1963 that President Sukarno coined the term konfrontasi, when he said that Indonesia would confront Malaysia over the inclusion of Sabah and Sarawak as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Malaysian Federation
        </a>
        , which would formally begin on 16 September 1963. By late 1962, Indonesia had increasingly become opposed to a Malaysia that included parts of the island of Borneo. Indonesia was already training insurgents to cross into Sabah and Sarawak and attempting to stop the federation planned for August. The Australian government saw this as a tricky situation. Indonesia was clearly an important neighbour but, through our involvement in the South
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">
         East Asian
        </a>
        Treaty Organisation and our obligations to a fellow Commonwealth member, Australia was involved. It was in January 1963 that Australian Navy ships were deployed off the north coast of Borneo. By September 1963, Indonesian-trained insurgents were crossing into Sabah and Sarawak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the experiences of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , when Japanese forces attacked the Australian mainland, the need for 'forward defence' was a government policy. Indeed, our policy of forward defence saw us embrace
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
         ANZUS
        </a>
        as an insurance policy in 1951. But it has increasingly been viewed that it was through the 1954
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEATO" rel="nofollow">
         SEATO
        </a>
        treaty, including the requirement to contribute a standing force, that saw Australia place troops in Malaya. As part of the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve, our soldiers, sailors and airmen became involved in the confrontation. Our contribution from 1964 saw 3RAR oppose Indonesian raids onto the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaya_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Malaya Peninsula
        </a>
        and then the deployment of troops on Borneo, all whilst the Air Force was active in the region and the Australian Navy was involved in restricting the opportunities for insurgents to move to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Malay Peninsula
        </a>
        by sea. Other Australian units included the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Special Air Service
        </a>
        , a troop of signallers, artillery and engineers.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the deployment of first 3RAR then 4RAR and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        onto Borneo itself, by 1965 the Australian and Commonwealth forces had begun to follow the Indonesian insurgents back across the border to gather information. By July 1965 special forces and infantry were crossing the border to ambush insurgents before they crossed over into Malaysian territory. In an increasingly hostile environment with aggressive Commonwealth military activity the insurgents struggled with any form of offensive capability, and then with the rise of Suharto the Indonesian interest and focus declined and by August 1966 a peace treaty had been finalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should remember that 23 Australians were killed during the confrontation, seven of them on operations, and eight were wounded. It is right that we should remember their sacrifice on this day. A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to speak to some veterans of the confrontation. They were in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        and, as they described to me, they were told they were sailing for the waters off north Borneo, but they did not know why. Not long after they arrived on station they opened fire, but they did not know who they were firing on or why. It is interesting to hear of that situation as it puts things in context. As we know, the role Australian servicemen played was not publically known for many years and this was not acknowledged by the government until relatively recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is true that the relationship between our countries was founded on our joint efforts to preserve peace and the integrity of South-East Asia, including through conflicts such as the confrontation. Our security partnership, including defence cooperation and our participation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements" rel="nofollow">
         Five Power Defence Arrangements
        </a>
        , has in the last two years been supplemented through the efforts of government to further strengthen ties between our countries through stronger trade links and other initiatives such as the New Colombo Plan. The relationship may have originated in the most challenging of times, but it has been enhanced and strengthened through wide and effective cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, my congratulations to the nation of Malaysia for 16 September and my enduring thanks and acknowledgement to those Australians who fought for the cause and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. They served with honour and courage. Lest we forget.

          I am happy to second the motion.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia and Malaysia share a long history of cooperation, and this year we celebrated the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. Our formal diplomatic relationship dates back to 1955, when Australia opened its first commission in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" rel="nofollow">
           Kuala Lumpur
          </a>
          . Our ties with Malaysia run deep. In the 1950s Malaya was one of our closest regional allies, and Australians fought extensively to protect it during World War
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
           II
          </a>
          . During that conflict many Australian soldiers were captured as prisoners of war, and Sandakan will forever be a place etched in the Australian psyche. Over 2,300 allied soldiers were killed as prisoners of war, including 1,787 Australians. It has been referred to as one of the greatest atrocities suffered by Australian servicemen during war. Sadly, it is scarcely remembered in Australia—but fondly remembered in Sarawak and Sabah in Borneo—that it was Australian troops that led the fight that eventually recaptured the island.
         </p>
         <p>
          This was the beginning of Australia and Malaysia's considerable military cooperation—cooperation that is still strong today. Throughout the last 60 years the defence relationship between our countries has changed and evolved. Australia supported Malaysia through the emergency in the 1950s, when Malaysia's government struggled to contain internal militant groups, and Australia then stood by Malaysia during the konfrontasi in the 1960s. Australia was a founding member of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangement" rel="nofollow">
           Five Power Defence Arrangement
          </a>
          s, an agreement that has become the cornerstone of Malaysian foreign and defence policy for decades. Our bilateral connections stretch much further, and the Malaysia-Australia Joint Defence Program is a pillar of our defence relationship. Under this agreement, Malaysia and Australia have defence force personnel stationed in each other's countries, facilitating exchanges and joint training exercises. This kind of exchange promotes collaboration between our defence forces, growing our regional defence relationships and increasing our strategic effectiveness. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements" rel="nofollow">
           Five Power Defence Arrangements
          </a>
          and the Malaysia-Australia Joint Defence Program are highly consultative arrangements. They place an emphasis on cooperation, consensus, trust and openness. They are examples of how Australia can work with other nations in our region to promote Australia's strategic interests.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have sought each other's assistance in international frameworks, dating back to when Australia sponsored Malaya's application for membership of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          . We are also active participants in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           Association of Southeast Asian Nations
          </a>
          , in which Australia is a dialogue partner, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" rel="nofollow">
           East Asia Summit
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
           APEC
          </a>
          . Malaysia is the chair of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
           ASEAN
          </a>
          and the East Asia Summit for 2015, as well as being a non-permanent member of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations Security Council
          </a>
          for 2015-2016—a position the previous Labor government fought to acquire for Australia for 2013-2014.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both Australia and Malaysia rely on the Indo-Pacific being a region where international law and norms are observed, where networks of effective multilateral institutions ensure conflicts are peacefully resolved and where countries are allowed to grow and prosper through further economic integration. With this basic common interest—an interest we share with all of our South-
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">
           East Asian
          </a>
          neighbours—our relationship with Malaysia has grown into far more than mutual security partners. Australia and Malaysia's relationship has grown so that Australia now has more people-to-people ties with Malaysia than the majority of South-East Asian nations. In 2011, there were over 110,000 Malaysian born people living in Australia and many more claiming Malaysian heritage—a community including prominent and successful Australians such as tennis star Nick Kyrgios. This diaspora community has been a powerful element in promoting trade and empowering our formal diplomatic relationship.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our economies are complementary, and we are in each other's top ten trading partners. We are also in each other's top tourism destinations. Last year, half a million Australians visited Malaysia and 300,000 Malaysians visited Australia. We have strong educational links. In 2012, there were over 22,000 Malaysian students studying in Australia and 21,000 Malaysian and international students studying for Australian qualifications while in Malaysia. In total, approximately 300,000 Malaysians have studied in Australia. These alumni connections are a great start, but if we want to properly engage we need this kind of educational exchange to be reciprocal, and we should encourage all Australians to live and study in Malaysia and throughout our region. This will not only increase our Asian language and cultural proficiency but create an environment for people-to-people relationships and common bonds to flourish in our national strategic interests.
         </p>
         <p>
          The relationship between Australia and Malaysia was once a result of convenience, geography and empire, but, over the decades, that has changed. Australia's relationship with Malaysia has changed from one of support in its early years to one of intense collaboration today. I am sure that this relationship will continue to grow and mature in future decades, and I know all members of the House support this object.

           Australian and Malaysia share a history of strong diplomatic relations dating back several decades in terms of economic, social, defence, and cultural ties. Australia's enduring friendship with Malaysia goes back a long way. This year marks the 60th anniversary of Australia's diplomatic presence in

           . The cooperative international relationship between our two nations has grown and matured dramatically over the past 60 years, from one of support in the early years of Malaysia's federation to one of close collaboration and comprehensive partnership today. Defence cooperation is the bedrock of this relationship. As the member for Cowan noted, our defence forces stood together through tough times and crises, including the

           The ties between Australia and Malaysia are set to expand even further as we work together to open up new opportunities for trade and investment. Australia and Malaysia are natural partners. We live in the same region. We have complementary economies. We share a stake in the region's security and prosperity. Australia looks forward to supporting a closer partnership between our countries into the future.

            I did not think I would ever hear a resolution like this being debated by the coalition. I am quite surprised, to be honest, because in the last term of parliament we heard terrible things being said about a neighbour, an ally and an economic partner like Malaysia—and it was said by the current Prime Minister. We heard senior frontbenchers criticising Malaysia, all in the context of grubby point scoring in the domestic political scene. It was about trashing the reputation of Malaysia during the course of debate on a domestic political issue and they were quite happy to do it. In fact, I never once heard the member for Cowan defend Malaysia—not once. None of these people defended Malaysia when their own leader, the current Prime Minister, was out there saying, for example, as he said to my colleague the member for McMahon:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            He can talk to Malaysian justice officials and find out about the kind of caning and other corporal punishment that boat people might be sent to if they are part of this Malaysian people swap that the Prime Minister wants to put in place.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is our current Prime Minister making out that everyone gets caned and subjected to corporal punishment if they are seeking asylum in Malaysia. The current Minister for

            , then the opposition immigration shadow minister, likened the treatment of refugees in Malaysia to that of mistreated cattle in Indonesia. 'I am equally shocked,' he said. 'If we are going to be consistent about these matters then I think the conditions these people will be held and treated in Malaysia is a relevant question.' He was making out that this is the way in which people are treated by a country so valued by our nation that it is a clear and more important figure within

            and within the East Asia summit. None of these people were making these types of references that we are hearing today. It is good that they are, but they did not say it at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            What happened? The Prime Minister on election, when he had to meet the Malaysian heads of government, then came out and apologised and said, 'Oh, well, we were probably too robust and probably over the top in what we said and it was wrong that it happened.' It is the classic

            play book. The Tony Abbott play book is to make the play and apologise for it later—to seek confession later but then to do this.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an outrageous treatment of Malaysia and it was an outrageous way to behave, and it should not be forgotten by our friends in Malaysia. Australia and Malaysia are key trading partners.

             Member for Cowan, I am on the record. When I have a disagreement with my leader over the way in which they might behave or contain themselves or say things that I believe are against the public spirit, you go and look at my record. I am happy to compare my record any day to yours, particularly in relation to this, and you know as well as anyone else in this place right now how close

             is to Malaysia and how important those links are. But the fact of the matter is you all sat there mute, because you were all happy—all of you were happy—to sit there and see Malaysia trashed in that way and not stand up for it at all. It was an outrage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you know what else happened as a result of this grubby political play? As a result of our inability to secure that agreement with Malaysia, 689 people died—689. And so what you did was that you trashed the relationship with Malaysia and, on top of that, you were happy to see that agreement go down, and as a result people paid for it. It was an outrage. So do not come into this place now. Do not come in here trying to say that you are all the friends of Malaysia now, because we remember and, importantly, our Malaysian friends remember exactly what you did.
