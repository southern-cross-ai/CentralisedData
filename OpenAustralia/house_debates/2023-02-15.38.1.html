        Last Saturday I spent the morning listening to residents of Kirribilli,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milsons_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Milsons Point
        </a>
        and

        . These areas are known for their heritage cottages and jacaranda trees, but what is less known is that they are among the most densely populated areas in Sydney, a small space with no less than 29 high-rise buildings. Almost every person who spoke to me was concerned about an imminent Transport for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        project. The construction of a cycleway on the north-west end of the

        </a>
        literally has residents and the local council tearing their hair out. No-one begrudges those wishing to use active transport being able to easily navigate the bridge—safe cycling infrastructure is vital—but the reality is that Transport for NSW's design will lead to a loss of green space, have a significant impact on pedestrians and deface the beauty of the bridge.
       </p>
       <p>
        In good faith, and at significant personal expense, the community pulled together to commission an alternative design for the ramp. The design minimised the impact on the community whilst still enabling freer movement for cyclists. The local council has endorsed the design. The locals believe it is a good compromise. But Transport for NSW will not entertain it. Today, I speak for all those who live in my community who are frustrated by what appears to be a complete bureaucratic brick wall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best outcomes for our community will be facilitated when all major stakeholders come together around a mutually beneficial and wanted project. We can have that with this bike ramp project, but it requires Transport for NSW to take a step back and be truly prepared to engage in an active conversation.
