        Today, 25 November, is White Ribbon Day, Australia's observation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The campaign works through primary prevention initiatives, which raise awareness by education and programs with youth, schools, workplaces and the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        On average, one woman is killed every week as a result of intimate partner violence. Intimate partner violence is the leading contributor to death, disability and ill health in Australian women aged 15 to 44. One in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them. The cost of violence against women to the Australian economy is estimated to be $15.6 billion per annum. These are frightening statistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor has committed to delivering a $70 million package that ensures that those suffering family violence can access critical services when they need them. It includes $47 million to front-line legal services, including Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        legal services, to ensure people experiencing family violence get legal support and do not have to go to court alone; an initial investment of $15 million in Safe at Home grants to help people affected by family violence to stay in their own homes; and an $8 million investment in mapping perpetrator activities, to look at the interactions between family violence, law enforcement, justice, child protection and related systems to help identify opportunities to prevent violence through information-sharing; and the announcement yesterday by

        of a commitment to five days domestic violence leave.

        I agree with Rosie Batty, Australian of the Year, who said of family violence:

        This is an entrenched epidemic that we've lived with since time began, so we've got a long way to go. But I do believe the tide is turned. It's no longer a subject that only occurs behind closed doors.
