        award for their passion and enthusiasm for their clients' needs resulting in a stronger business community. Congratulations to Michael K Elliot of Plantman Equipment in Bellevue who received both the Swan Business of the Year award and the Mining Services Award for their reliable and valued service to the community. Brett and Jody Carney of Bax Security Services in Midland were the recipients of the Quality Customer Service Award by combining their experiences as a former police officer and their quality-focused approach. Congratulations to all of these outstanding local businesses who were rightly recognised in the annual Swan Business Awards. I, along with the Liberal East Metropolitan Team, proudly support these awards every year. Unfortunately I could not make it to the awards this year; however, I heard that it was an outstanding night, as is expected for these prestigious awards.

        Small business is the engine room of our economy and the mainstay of our local community. This government is committed to helping small business and family enterprises get a better deal from government. We have already started to reduce business costs by scrapping the carbon tax and cutting red-tape to create the right environment for small businesses to grow and prosper. One issue that small businesses across Hasluck consistently raise with me is the need to reduce the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST

        -free import threshold to keep their businesses competitive and viable. Currently, the threshold allows shoppers to buy up to $1,000 worth of overseas goods online GST-free. Compared with our neighbours across the Tasman, who have their threshold set at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZ" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        $220, this is incredibly high. I have raised this issue with my colleagues here in the House and will continue to fight for a fair go for Hasluck's local small business community. I encourage business owners to get in touch with me and let me know how this issue affects them directly. I have already heard from many in Hasluck, however, and I am sure there are plenty more stories to tell. It is important that we encourage the growth of small businessâ€”it is the backbone of our economy and it gives the opportunity for local people to be employed, to become part of their regional and community economy but also, equally, to contribute to a much broader area around them. I congratulate all of the winners of the awards and I look forward to a continued working relationship with them all.
