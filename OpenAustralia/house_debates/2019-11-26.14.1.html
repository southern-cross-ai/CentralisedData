        As we approach the end of 2019, it's timely to reflect on the year that was. Prime Minister Scott Morrison performed a miracle by securing the coalition a third term in government. My constituents continue to be impressed with his enthusiasm, his commitment and his focus on outcomes. He has shown that our government is listening and will step up when help is required. I was honoured to be entrusted with a third term as the member for

        . This year I continued to work hard for the good people of my electorate. Issues in the agricultural sector have been front and centre, including supporting the live export trade and dealing with the crippling drought. The $140 million Albany Ring Road, the $40 million Southern Forests Irrigation Scheme, the Esperance jetty and the Kambalda pool are just some of the projects which I have delivered. Our National Regional, Rural and Remote Education Strategy aims to implement federal policies to ensure our regional youth get a fair go after they complete secondary education. We've successfully legislated our tax plan that will deliver more than $300 billion of tax relief over the next 10 years.

        Looking forward to 2020, I'm eager to hear new ideas as part of the

        inquiry into growing Australian agriculture into a $100 billion industry by 2030. This presents an exciting opportunity for the sector, and I look forward to attending public hearings around the country and, in particular, to bringing the committee to my own electorate. There is always a lot more to do, and we will continue to govern to improve the lives of people living in O'Connor and Australia.
