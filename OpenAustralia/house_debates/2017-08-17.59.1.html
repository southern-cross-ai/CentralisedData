       <p>
        Marc Stillhard is 16 years old. Marc lives in Yamba. Marc was born with Down syndrome. Marc likes to play team sport. He plays soccer, or football, for Yamba. He plays as a 12th man on the field. All teams in the competition are asked if they are okay that Marc play as an extra man. Someone recently complained about this—an individual, not a team. Football

        have been placed in a difficult situation because Marc playing as a 12th man is technically against the rules. I acknowledge the Westlawn Tigers, who have said they would be happy if Marc took the field this weekend.

        Sport is more than about winning and losing. Sport is more than the skills you learn, the friendships you make or the teamwork that you experience. Sport teaches us lessons about life. Yamba are lucky to have Marc Stillhard in their club. The competition is blessed to have him compete. I acknowledge Marc's mum, Enid, who like all mums has encouraged her child since the day he was born. I acknowledge all Marc's family and every parent, every player and every coach who has made it possible for Marc to play football up to now. Marc, I hope you are allowed by Football North Coast to take the field this weekend to celebrate more than football—to celebrate life.
