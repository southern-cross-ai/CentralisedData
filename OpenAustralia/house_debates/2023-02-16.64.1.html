        My question is to the Prime Minister. According to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG" rel="nofollow">
         KPMG
        </a>
        analysis, hundreds of thousands of Australians will face a $16,500 increase in mortgage repayments this year, following eight consecutive interest rate rises on the government's watch. Where are the cheaper mortgages the Prime Minister promised to deliver, and why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?

           The New South Wales Premier had this to say when they announced their own shared equity scheme, under the heading 'Thousands register for Shared Equity Home Buyer Helper ahead of launch': 'I understand the federal Liberal Party opposed Prime Minister Albanese's scheme; I think it makes sense.' He was then asked if they could change their tune, if they could come to their senses, and he said this: 'They'll see the light. I think it makes sense.' Turn the light on.

                 because he understands, as those on this side of the House understand, how critical it is for us to deliver more social and affordable housing. Indeed, it was great to be in his electorate last November, when we jointly announced more than 300 affordable rental properties that the federal government is contributing to at Westmead. We talked to a key worker, a midwife, about how great that rental property was for her and how important it will be for her to be able to continue her job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With the passage of our landmark legislation through this House, we have taken a big step forward to start addressing the nation's housing crisis. The legislation will create the $10 billion Housing Australian Future Fund. This is the single biggest injection by a federal government in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. Of course, part of that package is our National Housing Supply and Affordability Council—we will be getting advice from the council, for all tiers of government, about how to improve housing supply and make it more affordable—and the creation of Housing Australia, which will be the home of our housing agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The $10 billion fund, as I said, is the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. We on this side of the House make no apologies for trying to get this done as quickly as we can. We understand that people on the ground—the people who write to me and, I'm sure, many members over there every day, talking about how tough it is to be able to afford to rent a home—understand how critical this is, and we need to get on with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'd say to those opposite: stop saying no. Go back to your electorates after this parliamentary flurry, talk to people about social and affordable housing, come back here and tell your colleagues in the Senate to vote yes for this legislation. Get out of our way so that we can get on and deliver on our election commitment to help those Australians who are doing it tough and need this social and affordable housing; to help the women and children who are fleeing family violence—

                   to help to build more homes for veterans; and, importantly, to improve Indigenous remote housing. That is part of the legislation and part of what we're trying to do with this Housing Australia Future Fund. I cannot believe that members on the other side continue to say no to this. I want to thank all those members who actually voted yes. The crossbench all voted yes. The member for Bass voted yes. Of course, all on this side voted yes. But those on the other side continue to say no, and all this will do is delay this critical funding and getting homes on the ground. We need to ensure we get more homes on the ground more quickly for those Australians who need them.
