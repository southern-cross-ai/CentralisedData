       <p>
        Having spoken about that future, I must also thank those who have made my return to parliament possible. Key to my re-election is my greatest and most loyal supporter, my partner Lara Swift. With an intuitive sense of what needed to be done and the ability to get it done, she led my office brilliantly. I give a great vote of thanks to her as both my partner and my office manager.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank my mother, Connaught, who came from Sydney, as she does for all campaigns and worked long days leading up to the election, and my youngest daughter, Rebecca, for her tolerance and assistance in the campaign. She never makes me feel guilty for the time I have to spend on my duties. I also thank my oldest daughter, Emily, and her friend Hannah Spendlove for their work on election day. Emily, although just 15, is showing a great interest in campaigning and may be a booth captain in the future. Emily and Hannah put in some big days leading up to the election and I thank them greatly. I am very proud of both my daughters.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank my office team: Bill Coghlan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Dixon" rel="nofollow">
         Nick Dixon
        </a>
        , Dame Krcoski and Lien Nguyen. Bill Coghlan has been with me for almost six years. Lien Nguyen, who helps me brilliantly with the Vietnamese community issues and a range of broader constituent matters, has done around five years with me. Also I thank Nick and Dame, more recent staff members, who helped greatly. I also thank my campaign chair, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ellison" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Ellison
        </a>
        , and campaign treasurer, Richard Basham, for being there to make the campaign simpler and effective.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank the members of the Cowan division of the Liberal Party for their help leading up to and on election day. A special thanks goes to those hundreds of supporters who had my signs in their front yard or on their fence. The issues were almost entirely that signs were being stolen or graffitied. I am pleased that on only one occasion did my opponents cause damage to property, but I am thankful the damage was not permanent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank the several hundred booth volunteers, captains and scrutineers, who put in long hours, much of it in the rain and storms on election day. There were many first-timers in all capacities. I thank them for their courage and efforts on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I think of those who did strongly support me I am eternally grateful. I have never had to pay international students and put them in red shirts, like my opponent has had to do in the previous two elections. I also would never countenance having toddlers handing out flyers, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
         GetUp
        </a>
        ! did at the North Woodvale polling booth. Our opponents should remember that aggressive and loud browbeating of the voters is actually counterproductive. I am very proud of the integrity of my recruitment and the character and conduct of my volunteers. Once again I thank my volunteers for their efforts and exemplary conduct. I also note the efforts of Kieran Douglas and Bec McInnes, who are ever reliable and solid young volunteers. I can always depend on them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to turn now to the factors that caused the change of government in the 7 September election. I believe that the people of Cowan voted for me because they know I am dedicated to their best interests, and that they voted for the Abbott coalition government because we will restore hope, reward and opportunity to this nation. Those on the other side like to talk about disunity as the reason for their being voted out of government. At various times they talk about issues between former prime ministers, leaks and backgrounding as if their internal problems were the only causes of their demise. Yes, we know that former Prime Minister Rudd was difficult to work with and, together with concerning polls, was why the Labor Party got rid of him in 2010. Those such as the now Leader of the Opposition helped dispatch Prime Minister Rudd in 2010. In the face of depressing polls, he dispatched the next prime minister some weeks before the last election. He therefore played Brutus to two Caesars. Would that the soap opera of the Labor Party could be the quality of a Shakespearean play; while it has had both tragedy and comedy, it is really more soap opera than art.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the director of federal Labor and those opposite may feel that it is convenient to attribute their demise solely to internal fighting, the reality is that, while people have grown weary of the betrayal and intrigue of Labor, the betrayal was not just internal; it was also a betrayal of the Australian people. Of course foremost among the betrayal of taxpayers was the carbon tax that was guaranteed not to be before the 2010 election. But let us also remember every budget bottom line announced by the former government was always worse than what was originally announced. There were promises and announcements and even flyers about surpluses, but none of it was true. It is little wonder that the Australian people deplore both the internal machinations of the former government and the absence of its credibility. For years now the voters of Cowan have approached me on the streets and in shopping centres, sporting grounds and even said to me at their front doors that they wanted change—not only because of internal Labor divisions but also because of its repeated and comprehensive policy failures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of those issues, dealing with the illegal arrivals by boats was very big. I know that it is customary for the noisy, strident and left-wing minority to allege that anyone who talks about those arriving by boats is a racist or a bigot—which is, of course, not true. Those who speak against the boats do not talk about race or colour, but in an attempt to marginalise opposing views the left make allegations so that they can bully and intimidate opposing views. Sanctimony and dogma are the tools of the minority; the majority of Australians oppose the boats because, when the facts are revealed, those who come by boats are not the most deserving of a future in Australia, not when they have the money to bypass the system. The vast majority of Australians acknowledge that we have a responsibility to take in refugees and they merely want those who are in most need and those who can fit in well so that they have the best chance of success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The silent majority are not anti-refugees, and there is no fear or hatred such as the noisy strident minority view suggests. It is not racism, but it is a legitimate concern about the lack of integrity in our immigration system orchestrated by the abject failure of those opposite. It is about a weakness in the system established by the former government where there was doubt about exactly who was being accepted here. People did not like the special deals or the lack of action against those who abused the facilities provided by the Australian taxpayers. The lack of gratitude demonstrated by lawlessness was found to be particularly irksome by so many of my constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a related point, all would be aware of recent commentary in the media about persons holding Australian citizenship going to train for war and fighting as a mercenary or volunteer in Syria. Several years ago I spoke in parliament with reference to those who had been granted Australian citizenship as refugees only to travel to places like Yemen to undertake terrorist training. Those people represent a great threat to the security of this country. Similarly, we should view anyone who travels to Syria to take up arms with great suspicion. When people raise their right hand and make the oath or affirmation of citizenship it does actually mean something. When they say they pledge their loyalty to Australia and its people and that they will uphold and obey our laws, their pledge to this nation is broken when they take up arms and attribute that to some religious authority. I therefore encourage the immigration minister to examine the options of the withdrawal of citizenship for those who break their pledge to Australia. I appreciate the difficulties to ascertain the facts, but for those who already hold the citizenship of another nation and who break faith with this country through crime, then they should be held accountable and the withdrawal of citizenship should be an option. I supported this option before I was elected and I support it now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone who reads my speeches will know of the consistent themes that I pursue. I believe very strongly in this country and its achievements and I believe that the success of this country is entirely due to its commitment to Western democracy based on Judaeo-Christian principles. It is my view that there is no better nation in the world than Australia and there is no stronger and more positive or effective system of government than our democracy. If we believe anything else then we are failing in our duty to those who live here now and those who will follow us, because we will not leave them with the nation we ourselves were given. This is a reality that we must embrace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each night and day we should listen to the news and take notice of the economic, governmental, social and cultural failures that afflict so many nations around the world. We should not be afraid of looking at those nations and drawing from their experiences validation for what Australians and English-speaking Western cultures have created here in just over 200 years. Unfortunately, the situation we face is that some Australians are not happy unless they can find something in our history that we can cringe about or something which we want to express regret about.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems that in our attempt to express respect for the minority cultures of those who have immigrated here we now struggle to express confidence in the majority culture because this is seen somehow as some conflict. We should be unwilling to write ourselves off so quickly when those who have immigrated here are examples of a ringing endorsement of what we have achieved. That is the answer to why so many have come here or wanted to come here, people from non-English-speaking or non-Christian countries. Very simply it is because where they came from was not as good. If it was, then they would not have come; it is a fundamental truth. If
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        had the opportunities Australia had, then so many Kiwis would not be here. If England or Ireland had the weather, the opportunities or the lifestyle of Australia, then the English or Irish would not have come. It is simple. If there had not been wars in Europe—World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        and wars in the Balkans—or the hardships of post-war Europe, then so many would not have come from south-east Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was a functioning democracy in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , apart from Israel, or an economy of any strength that benefits the majority of people in the Middle East then there would be stability and so many would not be wanting to leave. Similarly in Africa, there are very few democracies that actually serve the people and the nations are generally defined by corruption, instability, conflicts, crime, low levels of development and often sectarian violence. It is not rocket science why people want to come here. They come because this nation represents the good governance, the strong democracy, the strong economy that provides opportunities to succeed. Success has come not because of luck, but because Australians have worked with the opportunities they have found and have not been held back by the political, economic, religious and cultural failures of other nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        A friend originally from Africa said to me recently, 'We wanted to bring the good things to Australia with us and leave the bad behind.' This is of course the positive attitude that identifies the truth that I speak of. My friend knows that the rule of law, the strong democracy, the strong economy and of course the opportunity to succeed that does not rely on your religion, your family, the colour of your skin or your gender are the factors that speak to immigrants. The words are that you and your children can be safe, can get an education and can get jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2011, I had the opportunity to visit the nation often called the 'cradle of democracy', Greece. I was in a high school and spoke to a class in the same way I do to students in my electorate. Among the many things I said, at one point I said to them, 'One day one of you could be Prime Minister.' For the first time at any school, a teacher later said to me, 'That can never happen in Greece, because prime ministers always come from the same families.' That experience made it clear to me that, while we should respect other nations, we should never show deference for no reason. The concept of democracy may have originated in Greece, but we have passed them by and we should be proud of what we have here.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I attend citizenship ceremonies, I am always proud of this country. I remind myself of the fact that every person that comes here is an endorsement of what makes this country the land of opportunity. If the countries of these immigrants were better, then they would not have come here.
       </p>
       <p>
        So much is said about a multicultural society. When I look at minority cultures and their value, I see cuisine, music and colourful dress but, above all, a good attitude to hard work and the value of education, along with other aspects that are embraced and relished by the wider community. These things add to the mix. Yet when I think on what my African friend said about leaving the bad things behind, then I see that there are some parts of minority cultures that we should reject as being unacceptable. Corruption and nepotism, elites based on families, religion or other hierarchical arrangements in the homeland should be rejected. The different treatment of the genders in clothing, education or opportunities et cetera should also be rejected. These are not modern concepts or the marks of a modern or successful society and we should not be afraid to call them retrograde cultural characteristics. These of course are some of the reasons that contributed to the substandard situation in the old countries that people wanted to leave. We should also be prepared to reject the claim that religion justifies these failed cultural elements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Above all we should focus on making sure those that legitimately come to Australia have the opportunities they seek. As I said, their opportunities are held back if they want to live under the same retrograde circumstances or cultural themes that held their old country back. That is why it is our duty to not accept or tolerate these low-standard cultural characteristics, because, if we do, then we tolerate people living in a parallel society. A parallel society is where we tolerate the problems which denied men and women the opportunities to achieve in their old country. Leading in this is the need to insist that immigrants speak English. No interpreters should be provided beyond the first year of a person living in Australia, as English language classes are provided at a cost to the taxpayers and they are enough to achieve proficiency. We should also be on guard against any further culture of entitlement, a sense that society owes anyone a living for doing nothing or that procreating is something that society should have pay for to such a degree that it is seen by some as an alternative to paid work. It is not a cliche that, if you do not pay for it, you do not value it. We must also reject any differences in the rights, responsibilities and standing of the genders.
       </p>
       <p>
        This country has a history of success that was built on hard work in a harsh climate, a success that was not built by people standing around waiting for the dole or freebies provided by those that do work and pay their taxes. The success of Australia was achieved because Australians, of whatever background, saw that their future depended on what decisions they made and the amount of effort they put into their education and work. It is true for anyone that, if something goes wrong in our lives, it is wrong to look firstly for someone else to blame or try to judge society, when the first step must be to look in a mirror and ask ourselves what part we played ourselves in the situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our duty is to pass on the best country that we can to those that follow us, and a failure to do so is a failure in that duty. We must acknowledge that there are other countries that have failed or been dragged down by negative cultural traits. So much have they been damaged that people want to leave and seek a better life. We should provide that better life by rejecting those substandard themes. If we tolerate people bringing the failures of their homelands to Australia, they will end up being no better off and, by us accepting failed cultural traits, we will also drag down the success that previous generations of Australians have achieved for us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again I would like to thank all those who assisted me in my re-election for this my third term: my office team, Lara, my mother, my daughters, my campaign team and my volunteers. While I alone do the doorknocking, there is more to winning than just that. Each of us needs a lot of help and I will always be grateful to those who did come and lend a hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would just like to finish by saying that my view of my position, my role, as the member for Cowan is clear. I am here for one purpose only and that is to help my constituents and to make their lives better. It is not about me; it is always and will always be about them. They have stories to tell. They have challenges to overcome. There are complexities in their lives that I do not have in my life. Yet when I speak to them I better understand how this country is made up. Problems and challenges are part of it and also success and achievements—bravery, courage, yes, but also weakness and frailty. In every suburb in Cowan there are different stories—things that need to be spoken about and things that need to be fixed. That is why I am here, and I will remain forever committed to the people of Cowan and to this great nation, the best country in the world, Australia.

        <p>
         Firstly, I congratulate all the new members of parliament who have been able to give their maiden speeches and some of the new members who are about to do that later this afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the people of Ballarat, I particularly again want to say thank you for re-electing me as your representative and for placing your faith in me once again. It has been a privilege and an honour to serve the community over the past 12 years, and it is with much humility that I continue to represent the people of Ballarat in this House.
        </p>
        <p>
         To my campaign staff and the countless hundreds of volunteers who fought the campaign for, in essence, three years but certainly over the last 12 months, who turned out in the early morning at train stations, who doorknocked in the hail and rain and sometimes snow, who gave up their time to stand on supermarket stalls and who handed out how-to-vote cards at prepoll centres and on election day, you have my eternal gratitude and my thanks.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a very hard-fought campaign, but the effort of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         supporters and volunteers was tremendous and often went well beyond the call. I also want to again thank my fantastic husband, Mark, whose support is always appreciated, and my lovely son, Ryan, for the work that they do for me as well. Ryan is still a little young to understand exactly what is happening in elections, but he was certainly much more aware of his mum's photo around the place this time than he was in the last election when he was only two.
        </p>
        <p>
         I joined the Labor Party because I believe firmly in the possibility of politics; not just the possibility of politics but what political office can do to improve the lives of people and the capacity of the country to grow and develop. I believe very firmly that every child should have the opportunity to have a good education—and that starts, literally, from birth; that their parents should have decent work and decent pay and decent conditions under which to work under; that the grandparents should be able to retire with a little more in the pockets; and that we can leave behind a fairer and more prosperous Australia for future generations. It is what I have strived to do representing the great people of Ballarat as their local member.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am extremely proud of what we have achieved in government. I was honoured to serve first as Parliamentary Secretary for

        </p>
        <p>
         I am particularly proud of the investments that we have made in my own electorate of Ballarat. There have been investments in education of over $115 million for classrooms, libraries and other facilities across our region. We have been able to see schools that had absolutely limited resources—no libraries, operating out of antiquated, draughty classrooms—being able to have state-of-the-art facilities. Seeing what that has meant and the lift that it has given for those schools and then the educational outcomes of those students as well as the community use has been something that will leave a long and lasting legacy for this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         There was funding for university infrastructure, including a science and engineering precinct, the Manufacturing Technology Training Centre at the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh" rel="nofollow">
          Bacchus Marsh
         </a>
         and Melton Regional Hospital. Funding in primary care included a new primary care facility for the Ballarat Community Health Centre at Lucas currently being constructed and an upgrade of Ballarat District Nursing and Healthcare—again, almost completed. There was the expansion of the Springs Medical Centre in Daylesford and the upgrading of the Creswick Medical Centre and the Elms Family Medical Centre in Bacchus Marsh—all really important projects in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our investment in infrastructure has extended to other regional projects, including the Clunes Museum—again, something that is just about to be opened; Doug Lindsay Recreational Reserve in Creswick; the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Australian_Democracy" rel="nofollow">
          Museum of Australian Democracy
         </a>
         at Eureka, which is providing a terrific platform for debate about democracy and education in democracy in this country; the funding of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Western Highway
         </a>
         , Ballarat to Stawell duplication, and funding for the Anthony's Cutting bypass; and delivering funding for new and improved halls, parks, streetscapes and playgrounds right the way across the electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yet, unfortunately, what we have seen in just the short time that the government has been in office is that much of this and much of the future economic development and growth and investment in infrastructure in Ballarat appears to be under threat by the new government. Last week marked some 50 days of the Abbott government's cuts to my electorate. From Bacchus Marsh to Creswick, from Trenton to Daylesford, critical projects and funding have been ripped away. These were projects that were budgeted for and announced in many instances prior to the government going into caretaker mode—contract negotiations being undertaken with the proponents literally now stopped in their tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new government has taken the axe to regional development funds that have poured critical money into infrastructure, including funding for an indoor swimming pool in Bacchus Marsh, a multipurpose centre in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Park
         </a>
         in Daylesford, funding to Hepburn Shire Council to improve Springhill Tylden Road, and key upgrades and redevelopment for sporting facilities across the Moorabool shire. These were not billion-dollar projects; they were projects of a small scale that benefited the entire community: a new swimming pool, a new playground and upgrades to a tennis court. They threatened nobody in terms of what the projects were going to do. They were not pork-barrelling; they were projects that were occurring in seats right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am particularly disappointed that the funding go to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ballarat" rel="nofollow">
          City of Ballarat
         </a>
         for the all abilities play space has also been cut. Libby's Play Space is an organisation that has been working with government, state and federal, and with local councils desperately trying to make sure we set up all-abilities play spaces across the country that provide examples for how you integrate and have a much more socially inclusive play space within communities. In particular, Libby's play spaces are spaces where you really cannot distinguish between the type of play that is available for children with disabilities and children who do not necessarily have those disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Libby's Play Space had been working with the City of Ballarat and with the local government area in New England. They had a commitment—in fact, much more than that; detailed designs and work done for the Regional Development Australia Fund round 5 that was going to all local councils—that both of those local councils would in fact be developing Libby's all abilities play spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         That funding has now been cut and there are many devastated parents of children with disabilities in the community of Ballarat who feel absolutely that, after having such a long flight, having done all the work with council, having had the council commit that the money coming from the federal government would go to this play space, they are now absolutely being ignored. I am quite sure that members of the New England community who were expecting that they would have an all abilities play space will also be in a very similar position. I think it is an incredibly important project and I certainly urge the government to reconsider. It is perfectly entitled to do whatever what it wants to do when it comes into government, but I urge the government to really consider, particularly in an area of disabilities and all-abilities play spaces, that perhaps these two projects were something that should have been given a little bit more thought.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other areas of cuts that we have unfortunately started to see impact on my electorate is the schoolkids bonus, which is going to affect about 9,500 families across Ballarat, meaning that families will miss out on $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in secondary school. All of that money was spent to help families with textbooks, uniforms and school expenses. Again, I have had representations from local constituents—who may or may not have voted for Labor in the last election—who have been pretty shocked to discover that the schoolkids bonus is gone literally overnight; parents who are on disability support pensions, who find it incredibly difficult to make ends meet. These are people for whom that extra money coming in at the start of the school year really made a difference between whether their family could budget throughout the course of the year or not. So again I urge the government to think very carefully about what it is doing and the impact it is having on families. It has incorrectly linked the scrapping of the schoolkids bonus to the minerals resource rent tax; it was never part of that. I find it extraordinary that the government would seek to try and politicise and hide its own cuts by combining it in that way.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other issue that I am extremely concerned about is the scrapping of the low-income superannuation contribution, increasing a tax on the retirement investments of some 23,800 of the lowest-paid workers in my electorate. We are not a wealthy community by any means; there are very few people who earn substantial amounts of money in my community. So when you do something like scrap the low-income superannuation contribution you are adversely affecting those communities where incomes may not be as high as in some of our major metropolitan capitals; and, certainly, having a significant impact on regional communities like my own.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not satisfied with their attack on critical infrastructure, parents and low-income workers, the government have also implemented a policy that further entrenches the digital divide between cities and the regions. The Prime Minister and the communications minister have pulled the plug on some 2,400 households and businesses in my electorate—for example, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Point" rel="nofollow">
          Golden Point
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pleasant" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery_Hill" rel="nofollow">
          Bakery Hill
         </a>
         —preventing them from receiving fibre-to-the-home broadband services. Some 3,500 premises in Daylesford, Hepburn,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Hepburn Springs
         </a>
         , Musk, Clunes and Trentham, along with 1,200 premises in Ballan and Myrniong will also now no longer receive fibre-to-the-home broadband services. That has been a devastating blow to that community; many small businesses have been established in those communities in anticipation of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         fibre-to-the-home. It is incredibly disappointing to think about what that is going to mean for those communities. These areas are now faced with the prospect of broadband operating on old copper cable or paying potentially up to $5,000 to have fibre connected.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right across my electorate, thousands of homes and businesses have been cut off with this digital divide. This was infrastructure that was especially important for Australia's regional communities. I am increasingly becoming concerned that one of the things that the government is doing in its attempt to slow down, to cut, to freeze, grants programs right the way across every portfolio area is stalling the economy. In fact they are also stalling regional economies. It actually matters to regional economies whether they have $100,000 coming in for a local sporting facility to be upgraded. That keeps builders, carpenters, electricians and other tradespeople employed in regional communities when those projects are being built. Invariably, in regional communities, it is locals who are employed in those projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, when you scrap, literally overnight, millions of dollars of funding across regional communities, that has an impact. When you are not going to be replacing any regional funding until 2015—there is a hiatus of a year—those economies will invariably slow as a result of that lack of investment. All of the projects committed to by Labor, budgeted for, would have been starting had we been in office.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again call on the government to think very carefully about the impact of the decision it has made to cut substantial funding out of regional communities. Many communities like my own are suffering because of what is happening in manufacturing. We need to be growing new jobs, we need to be making sure we continue to keep people employed in manufacturing—and I want to talk in a moment a little bit about the componentry in particular and what the government's cuts mean to that in my community. Other jobs are important as well; jobs in the services sector, for example. You cannot get people moving into areas if you do not have good services. You have to keep investments in health. You have to keep investments in education. You have to keep investments in community infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately we saw that experience in Victoria. When the new Liberal government came into power in Victoria, they literally were frozen for a year; they made no decisions for a year. Victoria has suffered on the jobs front as a result of that. I make a plea to this new government to get on with the job, to actually make investments, and to make sure you make investments in regional Australia. There is a whole list of projects that are there, ready, willing and waiting; that were ready for contracting; that really this government needs to get on with.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has said he will govern for all people, but all we are seeing, in regional Victoria in particular, is the stripping away of funding critical to the economic development of the area. For example, another important project in my community is the $9.1 million of funding for the Ballarat intermodal freight hub, a critical component of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballarat_West" rel="nofollow">
          Ballarat West
         </a>
         employment zone. This project is now in jeopardy because of those opposite threatening the economic empowerment and economic growth of the region. It was a project announced in the May budget and was very much lobbied for and wanted by the city of Ballarat, the committee for Ballarat and the local community. It is the linchpin for ensuring jobs growth in that new Ballarat West employment zone. Without it, those jobs will not happen.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have also seen from the government is the decision to cut millions and millions of dollars out of assistance for the car industry. There is an internal dispute happening within the Liberal Party about that at the moment. Unfortunately, it appears that the new Minister for Industry is going to have very little influence over what happens in that space.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many people employed in my electorate are employed in car componentry—brake components, seatbelts, small components—that go into Toyota, Holden and Ford. We are absolutely devastated, and there is huge uncertainty in the manufacturing sector in my community about what the government's intentions are towards the car industry, and, therefore, what will happen in the future of all of those jobs. Significant investment has been made in making sure that that car componentry sector is as productive as possible. There are people who have worked in that industry for 20 or 30 years—very proudly, increasing their exports, increasing their technology, increasing their skill base—yet they are literally being left potentially on the scrapheap by this government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister and the decisions that the cabinet are making are critical to the way in which our regional economies are operating and absolutely critical to making sure we have future jobs growth. I again urge them to think very cautiously about what the impact of not supporting the car industry has not just on those immediate direct jobs but on all of those downstream jobs, on car componentry jobs and then on all of those services that then help those agencies and those manufacturers in regional communities such as my own. There is a significant amount of those in places like Wendouree and Delacombe. I again think the government has not thought through what those cuts are going to mean on the jobs growth in my region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I want to just touch on my portfolio area of health as I head into the conclusion of this contribution. I am very privileged to have been appointed as shadow minister for health as part of the opposition team. I am absolutely determined to keep this government to account to ensure that the improvements and significant reforms through the health and hospitals reform process that were initiated by former Minister Roxon and continued by former Minister Plibersek are not undermined by this government. I am particularly concerned about hospital funding and what is happening in the future to the agreements with states and territories under this government. The initial signs unfortunately are incredibly concerning. The main focus of the minister, when he talks about his policy, is very much on shrinking health, on keeping it off the front pages of the newspaper and on talking about where cuts might be made or where savings might be made rather than talking about the huge possibilities and opportunities that are presented through government investment in health to actually improve the lives of Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has given no indication that it will even honour its own election commitments like not closing Medicare Locals, any Medicare Locals, let alone giving an indication of how it will fund the projected increase in the cost to the health budget as new treatments are recommended for listing on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as a new pharmacy agreement is negotiated or what focus there will be on preventative health. We have seen what the conservatives did in Queensland and there is every indication so far that this government will follow exactly the same script in health.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am concerned about the Grow Up Smiling dental program, which the government is now calling the child dental scheme that is due to start on the first of January. It is an incredibly important scheme to reduce the incidence of dental caries amongst young people and to really set young people up for good oral health for their entire lives. I am also concerned about the government's intentions towards those who work in the health system. As a former parliamentary secretary for health, I have great respect for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         officials and for the regulators I had responsibility for. They play a critical role in: protecting the rights of health consumers, making sure our medicines are safe, ensuring that consumers are protected when medical devices fail or food is unsafe; developing policies that will reduce the incidence of chronic disease and in responding to national and international health incidents such as a pandemic. So far the government has only talked about how savings can be made in these areas, not about how important these responsibilities are or how preserving them will be a priority. I will certainly be keeping a very close eye on the government not only on the cuts to the health services but also on cuts to our very good public servants in health.

          <p>
           As I deliver my maiden speech to the chamber, I wish to thank the people in the electorate of Hindmarsh for placing their trust in me to represent them. I am committed to representing them with diligence, determination and dedication over the next three years of this parliament, and hopefully, if I live up to the commitments to them, for some time beyond. I am honoured, privileged and proud to represent Hindmarsh, a place that has an exceptionally strong sense of community, a place that comprises and welcomes so many people of many different ethnic backgrounds, a place where small businesses drives much of the local economy, a place where hard-working people hope for a better future from their families and a place that I and my family are proud to call home.
          </p>
          <p>
           With this new government rests the hopes of the people of Hindmarsh. On September 7 they voted for change for themselves and for Australia. I believe we have a collective vision and focus on long-term strategies. I want to ensure that Hindmarsh and Australia will be even better places for our children and their children. In my new role, I aim to deliver the best results to make their hopes a reality. As the member for Hindmarsh, I will listen to my electorate and represent my constituents to the best of my ability to ensure their full participation in the parliamentary process. I want to acknowledge the work of the previous member for Hindmarsh,

           Hindmarsh is nestled between the city of Adelaide and the sea. With Adelaide airport at its centre, Hindmarsh is the first place that most visitors to Adelaide experience. Hindmarsh was named after the Rear Admirable Sir John Hindmarsh, a naval officer, who was the first governor of South Australia. It has great natural beauty. Kilometres of white sandy beaches with dunes and waterways including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Torrens" rel="nofollow">
            River Torrens
           </a>
           , beautiful parks and gardens, quality sporting facilities and items of outstanding heritage cover the electorate. A great number of seniors, service and social organisations make Hindmarsh a far richer and more supportive community. As one example, my young children, Sascha and Joshua, are currently benefiting from the guidance the West Beach Surf Club provides.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our vibrant multicultural community is an integral part of our society, from the migrants who left war-torn Europe after World War
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
            II
           </a>
           , particularly Greece and Italy, to those from Asia and more recently from Africa. Migrants provide Hindmarsh with an almost unrivalled richness of cultures and experiences and they will continue to have a significant impact in our community. Having lived and worked in Europe, I value the lessons I have learned from different cultures, values and perspectives. As a 17-year-old, I was lucky enough to live under the guidance of three very special Rotarian host families in Dusseldorf Germany, the Muller-Stulers, the Michaels and the Meyersieks, who all taught me so much in such a small space of time. The independence and confidence the host families fostered in me has held in good stead and helped me to develop into the person I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The people of Hindmarsh have dreams and aspirations that I share to give future generations an even better life than we have. We must leave a legacy for those who come after us to provide them with the opportunity to be rewarded for their hard work and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Demographically, Hindmarsh is one of the oldest electorates in Australia. As we know, senior Australians continue to play an important role in our community and families. After a lifetime of work and effort, they deserve support and quality service delivery. Consideration of the health and aged care interface and innovative solutions will be required to address the challenges of aged care.
          </p>
          <p>
           We also have a responsibility to ensure that we meet the needs of the people from whom we have inherited this great country while providing every incentive and opportunity for people to be self-sufficient through as much of their lives as is possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           Future reforms must continue to seek improvements in our tax system to best reflect the constant changes in our economy and social infrastructure needs. We need to create opportunities for those who otherwise would miss out. We need to find better ways to give people reliant on welfare a chance to continue to our society. As
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
            Sir Robert Menzies
           </a>
           stated, we need 'to give them a chance in life to make them not leaners but lifters'.
          </p>
          <p>
           But it is not just the role of government to help the less fortunate in our society. As individuals, we can take our own leads and, while I will be working hard for the people of Hindmarsh, I want to maintain my efforts to help others less fortunate.
          </p>
          <p>
           For more than 10 years I have raised money for charities and not-for-profits through a number of events. While recognising there may be a more popular and famous cyclist in our chamber, the most significant event for me was a charity bike ride in South Australia's beautiful
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Clare Valley
           </a>
           which raised close to $100,000.
          </p>
          <p>
           In life it is important to be part of a cause larger than ourselves. I salute Australia's many volunteers and commend the new wave of Australian philanthropists, including those working with our tertiary institutions to better our society and productive capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is worth reflecting on the position enunciated by the German philosopher
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Hegel" rel="nofollow">
            Georg Hegel
           </a>
           that 'an individual develops fully by sharing in and drawing on the moral, spiritual and intellectual resources of the society of which they are part of'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Innovation, knowledge and creativity are the new drivers of economic growth in developed nations around the world. But whatever economic model we pursue, we should seek to combine a sustainable environment and a sustainable economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I believe we should explore population policies that focus more on building regional centres.

            John Stuart Mill
           </a>
           , the state only has the right to intervene in the lives of individuals to prevent harm to others.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is through the work of individuals that opportunity and hope is created for all of our citizens. By building a strong and stable economy, government has an important role to play in providing the necessary support for all Australians.

            Prime Minister John Howard
           </a>
           said in his maiden speech:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … it is only through the creation of community wealth by the efforts of individuals … that it is possible for governments to undertake social welfare and to fund their operations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nobody likes being taxed but people will respect a government that spends the people's money responsibly and in an effective manner. In this way government is no different from a household or a business: it must live within its means.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to say a few words about small business, an issue so relevant to so many people in Hindmarsh. My mother was a small business owner and my wife is a small business owner. I understand the hard work required, the risk small business owners take and the frustrations they experience, particularly with unnecessary regulation. Red tape is making it difficult for many small businesses. By cutting red tape and letting small business do what they do best, we will create a more vibrant and entrepreneurial economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I look forward to working for the 12,000 small businesses in Hindmarsh, their staff and families. I know they welcomed Prime Minister Abbott's statement that Australia is again open for business.
          </p>
          <p>
           The need to improve our productive capacity is a major challenge for our country. If we fail to heed the lessons of the past and ignore the need to improve our productivity then we will be left behind as our Asian neighbours become even more competitive. We need to foster an environment where innovative sectors can grow and entrepreneurs can flourish. We need to seek and encourage greater business and technological innovations. Through smart regulation and competitive pressures, this can be achieved. But it will only be possible through the coming together of business and industry leaders and policymakers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many of our companies are facing challenging times with higher costs, an uncertain economic future and competition from overseas. Fewer taxes and regulation will provide some relief, but I think it is worth asking ourselves as consumers, what can we do?
          </p>
          <p>
           One thing we can do is promote the best that Australia has to offer. I know from personal experience that

          </p>
          <p>
           I am also certain that the members of this chamber are no different from the rest of Australia in recognising how good Coopers beer really is. It is made by the largest Australian owned beer company, not to mention our world-renowned Australian made wines. Wines from

          </p>
          <p>
           While we struggle with the competitive and strategic challenges facing some of our major businesses in South Australia, we should recognise that the likes of Santos,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Energy" rel="nofollow">
            Beach Energy

            ASC
           </a>
           have strong futures in the energy and Defence sectors. Our mining and resource opportunities are significant, and we will benefit from the removal of regressive taxes to help promote more investment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed from the smallest to the largest companies in Australia, there are so many businesses that reflect the strength of Australian innovation and creativity. If every Australian purchased more Australian made goods, it would help our companies, provide local jobs and incomes for families.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have a choice, we have the opportunity and we have the quality goods and services. At the end of the day it is up to us to drive the future as the future is in our hands
          </p>
          <p>
           As stated earlier, I believe in hope. I am an optimist, believing that no matter someone's start in life we should afford them every opportunity to succeed. That is why education is an area very close to my heart and one to which I want to contribute during my time in the national parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           My father is one of those many hardworking and committed teachers. To improve the quality of our students and their learning, things must change. Funding is always important and naturally there are instances when more is required. But it is not all about money. Reform should be undertaken to ensure more accountability in the quality of teaching. We should introduce more programs to better cater to the needs of gifted pupils and place more emphasis on early childhood development, given how important the first five years are to a child's life. Principals should have the ability to manage their schools the way they need to. I will work tirelessly to support our minister and education agenda.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia is a nation with limitless potential. We have many world-class businesspeople, entrepreneurs, professionals and scientists. In my doorknocking to win the seat of Hindmarsh, I continued to emphasise my drive to give our children the opportunities to work in the new economy of the future, where the internet is a great force of social interaction and commerce in the 21st century, where franchises are popping up in waves around our nation, where we will prosper by the clever use of our knowledge and high-level skills and where our neighbours have more spending power than ever before. Australia must take advantage of the Asian century and the growth of the Asian middle class. Their demand for our food, wine, fibre, energy and resources and education services provides a unique opportunity.
          </p>

           set the right path. We must dedicate our collective efforts to maximising this opportunity. We also need to invest in the future security of our country. The many employees in the defence sector in Hindmarsh look forward to the coalition's commitment to increase defence spending to two per cent of

           . Although the phrase is thrown around a lot, there are truly few 'nation-building projects'. The air warfare destroyers and the next generation of submarines are two such examples where Australian workers, South Australian workers, will be part of something special.
          </p>
          <p>
           South Australian industry, workers and families, including those in Hindmarsh, stand to benefit greatly from upgrading

           I thank the Prime Minister and his staff, expertly led by Peta Credlin, for the support they were able to provide during the campaign.

I look forward to working with the Prime Minister as he becomes Australia's infrastructure Prime Minister.

           I would also like to thank the many members of the then shadow ministry for the outstanding support they provided throughout the campaign, including yourself, Madam Speaker.

           To some relatively new family members in Trevor and Alison: it is wonderful to have your support. Two other special family members have been able to be make it here today: my treasured grandmother Margaret Schubert, who turns 90 next year, and my godmother and auntie Helen Miegel. Thank you for your support and guidance. The Miegel family, like ours, enjoyed many fine years in rural Australia.

I hold dear many good friends from those early years, two of whom are here: Janelle and Graeme Thompson. Naracoorte is in the electorate of Barker, which also has a new local member, my South Australian federal colleague Tony Pasin, whom I trust will be a fine member like those before him, including the former member for Barker,

          <p>
           My greatest thankyou is to my wife Leanne, for encouraging me when required, for questioning me when needed and for bringing our two wonderful children, Sascha and Joshua, into this world. Leanne, you have done so much to help me and I could not have done it without you. Please keep questioning me and testing me, as this journey is one that I will be taking together with you. And let me not forget the words of a former Prime Minister—to try and phone home twice a day!
          </p>
          <p>
           I have no doubt that the road ahead will, at times, be bumpy. I thank my staff, who have assisted me in these early days and who will be crucial to fulfilling my determination to deliver the best possible representation for the people of Hindmarsh.

          <p>
           As I start the journey as a member of federal parliament, I know it will be important to work with colleagues to deliver change. Hence, I want to acknowledge all new members in the class of 2013. We all come to this great institution with the right motives, no matter how different our approaches may be. I look forward to sharing this journey in making our nation better with all members of the 44th parliament, so that we can make a positive contribution to the future of all Australians.

             One of the warm memories I have of the federal election campaign of 1998 was seeing our Labor candidate for Lalor,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
              Julia Gillard

              Barry Jones
             </a>
             . On countless occasions that year people said to her, 'You'll have big shoes to fill'. Now I know how she felt.
            </p>
            <p>
             The electorate of Lalor has been well served by our members of parliament. Our area was proud of Jim Cairns' passion for justice and peace. Our area was proud of Barry Jones' dedication to knowledge and reason. I was so glad to see Barry last month at the launch of Clare Wright's marvellous book,

              The forgotten rebels of Eureka

             today.
            </p>
            <p>
             But we were so proud of Julia Gillard. Every day for 16 years we saw our local member set her alarm clock early and go out and stand up for the things she believed in and the things we believed in. She made a difference at Werribee Primary School; she made a difference in Washington

             and the Kennett government from turning our city into a toxic dump site, to this day, when she is working to improve education around the world, Julia Gillard has remained one of us—a decent, sincere, hard-working, unpretentious and optimistic person who endured more and achieved more, much of it in this very chamber, than I could ever describe here. She is a mighty Australian, a great Prime Minister and a bonza local member. I will just try to be worthy of my part in her succession every day in this place.

             So, with my first words in the House I thank Prime Minister Gillard. And there are some other people I also want to thank today.

            <p>
             Thanks also to everyone who worked with me and for me on all the campaign days. Thanks to Anthony for being there for everyone and to the remarkable Rondah Rietveld, who led a magnificent campaign team. And thank heavens there were too many of you to name, or we would never have got all the work done! Thank you all.

             One very special person, who will be annoyed at being singled out, is my great mate, Michelle Fitzgerald. Michelle and I had long been friends when we joined the Labor Party in 1996. Fitzy—thank you for everything, and I mean 'everything'. People who say that the Labor Party has lost touch with our values or lost touch with our community should spend some time with Michelle. That is all I need to say about her, and all I need to say about that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you to my family, without whom there would be nothing. John, I love you. Michael, Anthony and James, I am so proud of you. My boys now joke that despite the new career not much has changed; I will still get recesses and I will answer the bells! To my mum, my brothers and sisters and the extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews: thank you for your support, not just during the election campaign but always.
            </p>
            <p>
             And thank you, above all, to the electors of Lalor, who gave me their precious votes, and to every elector of Lalor who took part in our great democracy on 7 September 2013. You are Lalor people and I will represent you all here in this place.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stand here today because of four things. I am here because I am a Werribee person, I am here because I am the woman my family made me, I am here because I am a teacher and I am here because I am Labor. The culture that I love in my community, the values I carry from my childhood and career and the beliefs that I cherish in my party all hold together as one. Ours is a diverse and growing community. Indeed, it bears a resemblance to the home of our namesake. Like Ballarat during the gold rush, Lalor is a place of opportunity, a place where settlers from around the world come to test their fortunes and to make their homes. It is a place where the diaspora comes together to create a unique mixture of culture and language, and where traditions are accepted, created and cherished.
            </p>
            <p>
             But instead of the sprawl of ramshackle tents and timber buildings of Peter Lalor's Ballarat, ours is a modern, thriving city. When Julia Gillard first stood as candidate in the 1998 election, 169 votes were cast in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Cook" rel="nofollow">
              Point Cook
             </a>
             . At the most recent election over 10,000 voters in Point Cook made their voices heard, and I have no doubt the population will continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yet, despite this growth, Lalor is a place of deep-rooted history. It was the home of the Woiwurung and Wathaurung people before it became a stopover for early settlers travelling between Geelong and Melbourne.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_River" rel="nofollow">
              Little River
             </a>
             was the place my ancestors chose to settle in the 1850s and I am truly proud that it forms part of the electorate I represent today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lalor is also a place of breadth. It extends, as the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">

              Chirnside Park
             </a>
             . It is a place that encompasses both new and old, and with this come significant challenges: not just the adversity associated with meeting employment, infrastructure or service needs, but also, and most importantly, the challenge of continually building a connected, inclusive and just community. This challenge is met every day because, despite their differences, the people of Lalor share the same spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are home to an ethic of service: we know how to help each other. We are home to an ethic of struggle: we know how to fight for what is right. And we love our people and our place. In Lalor we know that fairness and opportunity are something that we have a responsibility to achieve for one another. We know that, even in a great social democratic nation, society is not always fair. And that means we know that we have to take care of our own. That is the spirit of our Indigenous people. The fight of local Koori people, including my nieces Caity and Alix, to proclaim their history and heritage is testament to their tenacity. I reflect upon this every time I take part in an acknowledgement of country.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is the spirit of the people who have family roots in the district going back to the 1840s. They came and they built. I reflect on it every time I go to my electorate office, which is on land once owned by grandfather and where my uncle and his family built their home. And that is the spirit of the people we welcome to Lalor from all over the world every year. They have made the same journey my ancestors made from Ireland and Scotland, that the Italians, Greeks and others made following World War

             communities and in people of dozens of other creeds and places of origin—the very same character, the very same beliefs. They arrive ready to be part of our community, like they have been here all their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             Madam Speaker, that is the spirit of our area. I am here to represent that spirit because I am a Werribee person. Werribee is under my fingernails and under my feet. And I am here to represent that spirit because I am the woman my family made me. They are in my blood and bone.

She finished her service as Australia's first plastic surgery nurse and she received the Royal Red Cross First Class. I am here because I am a Farrell, granddaughter of Bill: a Tasmanian, a miner, who enlisted, aged 21, in 1914. He described himself as 'an Anglican, with no prior service but a good rifle shot'. He fought with the 12th Battalion, Third Brigade, and later with the 51st. And I am here because I am a

             . Lillian, my grandmother, was one of 13. She knew about service to family and showered love on us all—and, yes, that Anglican digger had to convert to Catholicism to marry her. That was what diversity look like in those years.
            </p>
            <p>
             My father, Gerald, and my mother, Dot, made our home at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Park" rel="nofollow">
              Werribee Park
             </a>
             and later in Werribee. I am here because of them. My father was a dairy, sheep and grain farmer—and if you know farming, you know that means he showed his eight children what work was. My mother became a widow in 1973—and if you know widows you know that means she showed her sons and daughters how to rely on themselves. My mother taught us about inclusion and patience and love. All were welcome in her home and in her heart. Mum raised eight of us: two teachers, two disability advocates, a lawyer, two truck drivers and a publican. She taught us that each of us could and should do whatever it was that fulfilled us. I often joke that there are two genetic strands running through us: one entrepreneurial, the other public service. I think the publican probably did his share of both!
            </p>
            <p>
             I grew up in that family and I grew up in that community. They taught me service and struggle and to love that place. When you are the seventh child in an eight-child pile-up, you also learn to speak your piece. School for me was

              MacKillop College

             , when it was just a couple of portables in a cabbage patch. For a while I worked as a packer, and for my sins I even worked in sales. But the teaching degree I began at Melbourne State College in 1980 was the great professional moment of my life—before today. Teaching became my passion and my life. I remember my students at Darwin High School, Laverton High School,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvin_Park_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
              Galvin Park Secondary College

             and, most recently, Moonee Ponds Primary School.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carroll" rel="nofollow">

             , one of those students from Laverton, is with us today. He represents them all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Year after year those kids would come in thinking in black and white and they would leave seeing the shades of grey. Year after year those kids would come in feeling small and they would leave writing their lives large.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_English" rel="nofollow">

             , I could help them out at the start of their lives as citizens not just as consumers. Looking at them, I knew that there would come a time when they would want to write their story. Teaching them, I knew that in that moment they would not be alone or unable because they would have the language to participate and the skills to make their voices heard. Working in the classroom alongside those young people gave me such an opportunity to make a quality intervention and make a difference in a life. Serving as a principal gave me a whole other insight into the big picture challenges to ensure quality in every classroom, to minimise between-school differences, to change teaching practice, to realise the potential of every child.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was also then I fully recognised the achievements of another Western suburbs Labor MP.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Kosky" rel="nofollow">
              Lynne Kosky
             </a>
             , then Victorian minister for education, was the first to implement genuine needs based funding for our schools. This seminal shift radically enhanced how we could teach and foster our young people. I was fortunate to see Lynne in the electorate on Saturday at the Point Cook Relay for Life. As always, she was out in front, leading her community to support one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was also as a teacher and principal I experienced the transformative impact of national partnerships funding, another Labor achievement. As a principal in Melbourne's western metropolitan region, I experienced firsthand the changes the funding and research based improvement strategies could achieve. Inspired and guided by regional network leaders and committed local leadership, we implemented strategies that saw our region become the fastest improving region in Victoria over four years. I saw firsthand the positive difference this made to student learning and to family expectations. I saw that when governments get serious, lives change. That opportunity and that insight will be with me every day here, in every issue and debate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also here—and I am only here—because I am Labor and, really, I am Labor because of CSR. The dramatic story of the campaign to save my town from the toxic fate that threatened us in the 1990s is well known in my electorate. And it is literally a dramatic story. With a friend I wrote a play about it called
             <i>
              Hole in the Ground
             </i>
             . I could be here till Christmas telling you of all the things a lot of us did in those days, but I will not because I respect the conventions of a first speech to avoid partisanship and controversy and, believe me, when I talk about what Premier Kennett and CSR wanted to do to us there is not much that is bipartisan or uncontroversial in what I had to say.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what I do want to reflect on today is what I learned and what my community learned in that campaign. We learned that we had a voice and that we could make it heard in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Street" rel="nofollow">
              Spring Street
             </a>
             and beyond. We learned to collaborate, to organise and to fight. This was no crude exercise in populism. We did not just win the campaign, we won the argument. We overcame through head not just through heart and, when the business was over it turned out that this vital development was not so vital after all. It was never built anywhere, and there is a lesson for all leaders in that.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fight was led in true Lalor fashion by a diverse bunch—a suburban solicitor who cut his teeth fighting for Indigenous land rights in Queensland, Frank Purcell; a farmer, long-serving local councillor and leader in our community, Julian Menegazzo; an academic, a tireless activist for social justice and the environment, Harry van Morst; and me. We were joined by our community in all its shapes and sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will never forget the amazement and excitement and delight of many of my conservative friends in a place which still had many of the features of an old Australian country town when they found out that the unions were coming. We were 15,000 gathered in protest at the Werribee racecourse on a bitterly cold autumn night when we heard that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Hall" rel="nofollow">
              Trades Hall
             </a>
             was not only supporting us but that union women and union men would stand alongside us and join the blockade if it came to that and they would not leave until the job was done. It was our Eureka moment, when we knew we would persevere, knew we would prevail.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was also a stark moment of understanding who was on our side and to whom we could turn for help. We knew from day one that it was no accident that the leaders of a Liberal government and CSR thought this dump should be in our postcode not in theirs. We rapidly found out it was no accident. It was the unions and the Labor Party led by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brumby" rel="nofollow">
              John Brumby
             </a>
             we could turn to for support—the same people that will always stand alongside those in need, that protect our kids with their strong work ethic and eagerness to please from the vulnerabilities of an unsafe workplace, that have fought and won the conditions we take for granted and who with courage and kindness fight for those unheard. So, yes, I come here very proud to speak for Labor.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have a lot to do in this place—infrastructure, health, disability care. My community needs services and infrastructure and we need them from all levels of government and we need them on time. Our nation needs more too. We need real action on climate change and continued commitment to an inclusive, caring and just society. We need economic growth and job creation. We also need to have what my predecessor described as a 'sophisticated conversation' about the role of gender in this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what must underpin all of this is education, because nothing matters more. It is a tribute to Labor's legacy in education of generations past that someone like me from a family like mine is standing here today. I am here to accept a great responsibility—to hold on to that legacy and to fight for it. But I also come to fight for the future. I carry with me the hopes of those I have worked beside—hardworking, creative, collaborative teachers and principals who are dedicated to the complex work of taking every child on a productive and fulfilling learning journey. I will be fighting for them, for our schools and for students. I will fight to ensure that promises are kept and that the future of our kids whether they be in Woolwich or Werribee is not determined by their postcode, and to ensure that education is held up as the great equaliser and liberator it truly is.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know this as a Werribee person, as the humble daughter of Ryans and Farrells and McNaughtons and McCarthys, as a teacher and principal, as an activist and as a passionate Labor representative. That is the service ahead of me in Canberra. And because the politics of a democracy is a contest of interest and ideas, that is the struggle ahead of me in Canberra too. It is not the way of these speeches or the nature of these occasions to reflect on the political forces we oppose. There will be time for that. Thank you, Madam Speaker, I cannot wait.

               Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I rise in this chamber for the first time today I want to say how honoured and privileged I am to be here representing the place I was born and raised, the electorate of Deakin. I am deeply conscious that many of the hopes and aspirations of my constituents will ultimately rely on the success of the government I am so proud to be a member of. I would therefore like to place on record my thanks to the people of Deakin for putting their trust in me and also to convey my sincere commitment to faithfully serve their best interests.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I stand before the parliament, I must firstly acknowledge that I would not be here without the devotion and love my parents. Like many, my family background and upbringing is what shapes and informs my fundamental political values and ultimately my mission in this place. My father was a migrant who came to Australia at the age of 18 in 1966, from Bashari, a small farming town in the

               Like all people in small business, my parents worked incredibly hard and, as a family, we experienced the joys and opportunities as well as the hardships of this life. My father often worked seven days a week and I still have vivid memories of waking up in the middle of the night to find my mother doing paperwork under the dim light of her desk lamp. I witnessed how hard my parents worked to provide me and my siblings with all the opportunities they had never received
              </p>
              <p>
               From these experiences the concepts of individual responsibility, thrift, self-reliance and reward for effort became innately part of my own values.

               Not only was my father a migrant to Australia but my mother also had a diverse background: her father a Norwegian migrant and her mother a fifth-generation Australian. This cultural diversity has given me an appreciation of Australia's dual strengths as a nation. On the one hand, I keenly understand that our migrant history has contributed immeasurably to forming the cultural and economic foundations of Australia. On the other hand, our country's countless migrant success stories could never have been achieved without the values and institutions that Australia was blessed to inherit from Britain: the rule of law, parliamentary democracy and our broader Judaeo-Christian values have been the sure foundations upon which our migrant nation has been given the opportunity to succeed.

               More than 20 per cent of people in Deakin were born overseas, with their diverse cultures etched on the very foundation of our local community. Like my own family's experiences, vibrant ethnic communities—be they Chinese, Italian, Vietnamese, Indian or Burmese—are flourishing and they enrich the cohesive yet distinctive Deakin community.
              </p>
              <p>
               I stand in this place as the member for Deakin and my love of the Deakin electorate is derived from my deep roots and life experiences in the electorate. I was fortunate to grow up in Deakin, attend school in Deakin, get my first job in Deakin and most importantly meet my beautiful wife, Anna, in Deakin. My life is therefore indelibly intertwined in the fabric of Deakin and for that I consider myself blessed to be its ninth member since 1937. Encompassing suburbs as varied as Ringwood, Mitcham, Blackburn, Nunawading, Croydon and Vermont, the Deakin community is a strong one. It is free of pretension and deeply proud of our nation's heritage. It is a community held together by our shared commitment to family, hard work and generosity. Deakin is also an incredibly active community. We have a wide variety and breadth of service organisations, church groups and sporting clubs, each with tireless volunteers who care deeply about improving our way of life.
              </p>
              <p>
               Importantly, this strength in our local community is not achieved through government mandate, regulation or handouts but from the principles of looking after your neighbour and doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. This was fostered by my Liberal Party predecessor,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Barresi" rel="nofollow">
                Phil Barresi
               </a>
               , who served the people of Deakin for the 11 years of the Howard government. Phil was my local member during those years and his example as an active, energetic and strong local voice is one I will seek to emulate. In doing so, I am committed to being part of an Abbott-led government that by strengthening Australia also strengthens my own community. That is why I will continue working to deliver on our pre-election commitments to build the East West Link, reduce cost-of-living pressures by repealing the carbon tax, and improve the economy and strengthen job security through the removal of unnecessary taxes and regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I come here not only as a representative of the electors of Deakin but also as a member of the Liberal Party. I chose to join the Liberal Party because it stands for what innately makes sense to me: individual responsibility, reward for effort and a commitment to the values and institutions that have stood the test of time. My motivation for entering public life is clear. I want to help make Australia strong, prosperous and generous. I want us to be strong in our values and freedoms, strong in our family and community life, strong in our sense of nationhood and strong in the institutions that protect and preserve our democracy. Being the member for Deakin it is poignant to note that the Liberal Party has always, through many twists and turns, traced its origins back to the namesake of my electorate,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin" rel="nofollow">
                Alfred Deakin
               </a>
               . Deakin's view of liberalism is still relevant today for to Deakin, as to every other great leader of Australian liberalism, the sovereign idea which inspires our side of politics has always been the same: our belief that the paramount public value is the freedom of the individual.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a speech in this place in 1912, this is what Deakin said in outlining a vision for Australia:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               It means the full calling forth of all the powers, abilities, qualities, and characters of the people of Australia, not their suppression as citizens, not their dressing always in the same garb and being driven along the same road under the same whip.' It means no such subjection. But, given fair conditions … within the means of Australia, each of its citizens living his or her own life, and doing the best for himself or herself …
              </p>
              <p>
               As the federal member for Deakin I want to ensure that our Australia remains true to these Liberal values by keeping our economy strong so that individuals, families and businesses large and small can plan for their future with confidence and do the best for themselves. Our party understands that without a stronger economy our nation's noble aims and aspirations become unattainable.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an economic liberal my instincts are for open markets, free competition and small government. Thankfully, open markets and free competition are now largely accepted by both sides of politics and have driven Australia's wealth creation of the past three decades. However, as I see it, the greatest challenge the Liberal Party today is battling is the ever-increasing size of government. Believers in big government, like the Labor Party and the Greens, think Canberra can and should solve every problem. I do not accept this. More often than not, governments create more problems than they aspire to fix. Government intervention should be limited to what is vital. Big government crowds out a capable private sector, which disproportionately impacts small businesses—businesses run by Australian mums and dads just like my own parents. We need to ensure that no regulation and no compliance burden is imposed on business unless it is absolutely necessary and the policy objective cannot be achieved in any other way. In my view—a view that has been formed by my years practising as a tax lawyer—every piece of legislation should be subject to rigorous impact analysis. We must never forget that the regulations we impose on industry invariably result in the imposition of compliance costs. The big-government, interventionist approach of the Labor Party saw an additional 21,000 new or amended regulations in just six years. Such intrusions into the economy act as a disincentive to innovation and creativity and make it more difficult to attract foreign investment. I hope that my experience in the business sector, including as a lawyer with Ashurst and before that with PricewaterhouseCoopers, will enable businesses that are the very engine room of our nation's growth to become better understood as our parliament makes laws that affect them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Big government also increases the opportunities for waste. After the last six years of Labor we know all too well how wasteful an unrestrained government can be. Therefore, by limiting the size of government we impose a discipline on future governments, which ensures careful consideration is given to all spending decisions, much like any private business. Imposing such discipline is critical, especially if one accepts that governments can rarely spend your money as wisely as you can.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another ongoing challenge for modern Liberals is our never ending pursuit to end the culture of dependence. On this topic the father of American conservatism the great
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F_Buckley" rel="nofollow">
                William F Buckley
               </a>
               , whom I have long admired, once remarked:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               There is an inverse relationship between reliance on the state and self-reliance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Combating the culture of dependence is not merely an aspirational ambition; it is likely to be the greatest challenge to Australia's ongoing fiscal strength.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our welfare state commenced when fertility rates were higher, life expectancy was shorter, medical costs were lower and the percentage of the population over 65 was a small proportion of what it is today. This structure is increasingly unsustainable. All successful systems evolve with time and these systems must do so as well. Therefore, government has a duty to constantly encourage, and indeed insist on, all of its capable citizens to participate fully in our economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               In an economy with historically low rates of unemployment it should concern all of us that significant industries, such as mining and agriculture, cannot often find sufficient men and women to fill well-paid jobs. While we are right to have a strong and generous social safety net, overdependence on welfare can become demoralising and dehumanising. It can also become a generational problem. It is, therefore, a sense of compassion which informs my ambition to combat an overreliance on government. The collateral benefits to this approach provide not only a public dividend but also a personal dividend that can come only through the dignity of employment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another area of great significance for our future will be reforming and simplifying our complex tax system. As a tax lawyer working on the front line against the carbon tax and mining tax, I have seen up close the devastating impact of expansionary and poorly implemented tax policy. I have also seen that in a world of global capital and competitive tax regimes, the threat of sovereign risk is highly damaging to our economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               In contemplating these big issues, my own personal brand of politics combines liberal economic notions with strong conservative foundations. My conservatism has been informed by the two most significant influences on my life—my family and my faith. I have spoken of the influence of my family. While faith is a personal matter, my Catholic faith has been a great source of personal strength. It also lays the foundations for my desire to pursue justice for all those suffering injustice and compassion for those who are less fortunate. My many teachers and mentors from
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquinas_College" rel="nofollow">
                Aquinas College
               </a>
               must be thanked for helping shape these values in me, as well as for their dedication to my education, including Paul Neeson,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burke" rel="nofollow">
                John Burke
               </a>
               , the late Dave Mallia,

               and my old school principal, Tony O'Byrne, who joins us in the gallery today.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a conservative I also believe that families will always be the most important unit in our society. This basic premise requires governments to constantly consider the impact of all new laws on families. Failing to do so will have a public cost as well as a deeply felt private cost. It must, therefore, be an issue that we keenly consider.
              </p>
              <p>
               Finally, in my view, our egalitarian principles of fairness and equality are built on Western foundations and traditions. It is, therefore, the duty of conservatives to protect those from the so called 'progressive' elements of our society, who so doggedly seek to undermine them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I could never have imagined that by the age of 32 I would be standing here today serving in a government that I truly believe offers Australians the hope, reward and opportunity we all deserve. I have this extraordinary privilege because of the trust and hard work of so many people. It was not an individual effort but a team effort. There were literally hundreds of people who worked tirelessly to get me elected.

               Firstly, to the members of the Liberal Party and, most importantly, my local members: thank you for you unwavering support. I always felt as though I had a battalion backing me up. I would also like to record my debt of gratitude to Sandra Mercer-Moore, who has believed in me from the beginning. You are a wonderful mentor and friend, and none of this could have been possible without you. Also to Jill Sand and Beverley Hourigan: I am so grateful for your love and encouragement.

To the party's state director, Damien Mantach, and all of his team, including Andrew Cox and Simon Frost: thank you for your friendship, perseverance and professionalism. Also to my state parliamentary colleagues: thank you. I look forward to working together cooperatively, as we did during the campaign.

              <p>
               To my mother and father: thank you for your love and dedication as parents.

That also applies to my wonderful parents-in-law, Phil and Carol, as well as Matt and Tess. Most importantly to my darling wife, Anna: your unwavering confidence in me, your steadfast support and your endless optimism really are a source of continued strength for me. You are my partner in life and love, and I could not imagine embarking on this service to our country without you by my side.
              </p>
              <p>
               In conclusion, I want to reaffirm what an enormous honour it is to represent the people of Deakin in this parliament. My commitment to each of you is that I shall never forget, nor disregard, the faith you have placed in me, and I will do my best every single day to make Deakin and our country an even better place to live. Thank you.

                 I would like to start today by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and pay my respects to their elders both past and present. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands within my electorate, the

                 I am the 16th person to be elected to represent the seat of Bendigo, a seat that has existed since Federation. I am also the first woman to be elected to represent the seat, so in this election we made some history. Being elected as a representative to the Federal Parliament is one of the highest honours that one can receive from their community. I am proud, honoured and excited to represent the people of Bendigo. Like many real locals, I love my part of the world and could not imagine wanting to live anywhere else.

                <p>
                 Bendigo is made up of a diverse collection of small villages from Newstead to Newbridge; beautiful towns like Woodend, Castlemaine, Heathcote and Kyneton; and the regional city of Bendigo. It is a vibrant region with a proud history and exciting future. And yet despite their diversity and unique characters, the villages, towns and city have one thing in common—that is, community. Together as a community we strive to make our region a better place to live and to work: together we encourage our entrepreneurs; together we take care of our most vulnerable; together we can celebrate our achievements and face our difficulties.

                 Today, I am here to share not just some of my story but also the stories of the people and the communities I seek to represent. Let me start with the story of our local economy: its strength is its diversity. Businesses located in Bendigo and our surrounding communities work hard to become experts and innovators in their fields. Aided by the growth of Bendigo, our finance sector, led by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                  Bendigo Bank
                 </a>
                 , continues to prosper. There are not too many postcodes around Australia that can boast a bank; the postcode for Bendigo, 3550, is one of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Bendigo electorate is home to a growing number of arts professionals. With the right mix of commercial, public and community investment our cultural industry will continue to grow. My vision is for Bendigo and central Victoria to become a hothouse for the arts and a robust cultural economy.

                 Our education and health sectors continue to flourish, but also face many challenges. Bendigo aims to become a university city, something that I support and will work to achieve. Our Bendigo campus of the

                 </a>
                 is thriving and quickly becoming a centre of excellence in the health and allied health fields. The only missing jewel in the crown is a school of medicine. A long-term vision for the Bendigo La Trobe campus is to one day have a medical school within its School of

                </p>

                 Across the electorate there is a network of hospitals,

                 superclinics, community health organisations and Medicare Locals working hard to keep our communities healthy. However, aging infrastructure and a highly competitive funding model means that funding is a growing challenge. I believe that funding for our community health centres and small regional hospitals needs to be reviewed and increased if we are to meet the primary health needs of our region going forward.

                 Local manufacturing is a good news story that I wish to share with the House. Not afraid of innovation, a number of Bendigo manufacturers such as the Australian Turntable Company, Industrial Conveying Australia, Keech Castings and Hoffman Engineering are world leaders in their fields exporting to countries all over the world. These manufacturers tell me it is not red tape that is holding back the growth of their businesses, but the ideologically driven policies of governments that are creating road blocks and hindering their growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Take the story of Hoffman Engineering, one of the world's largest manufacturers of gears and gear boxes. They are currently rebuilding wind turbines from Germany in order to improve their energy efficiency. These wind turbines are sent from Germany to Bendigo, rebuilt by Hoffman and then sent back to Germany. Why? Because Hoffman are the best in their field. If Hoffman wanted to supply the Victorian wind energy generation market, it would struggle because the state Liberal-National coalition government has effectively banned the construction of new wind farms in Victoria. The government is creating road blocks and stopping the expansion of industry, preventing job growth in regional Victoria. One can only wonder what the effect of today's discussions and debates in the House will have on the wind and solar energy projects in

                 is the state member for Macedon. I am proud to be part of a Labor movement that values the contribution that men and women can make to public life by firstly preselecting and then working really hard to ensure that progressive candidates are elected.

                <p>
                 In the first week of this parliament those on the other side suggested that they promote on merit, yet there is only one woman on their front bench and only a handful of their new members are women. Is the coalition suggesting then that there are only a few women with merit to preselect and appoint from within their party and caucus room? I find it hard to believe that this is the case. Perhaps some in this parliament are still wearing gendered lenses. From the parliament to the boardroom to our communities here and overseas, there is still a lot of work to be done to advance the status of women everywhere. I am a member of the Zonta Club of Bendigo whose members are actively working to do exactly this, locally and globally.

                 Allow me to share the story, with their permission, of our local Aboriginal people, the Dja Dja Wurrung people. Last Friday, in Bendigo's Rosalind Park, the state of Victoria returned the lands to the traditional owners, the Dja Dja Wurrung people. It was a powerful ceremony. As a handful of land was transferred from the Governor's hands to the Dja Dja Wurrung people, new relationship was formed. Finally, our community in Central Victoria had put right a moral wrong.

                 </a>
                 to put right a moral wrong. At the time Paul Keating said: 'We give the Indigenous people of Australia, at last, the standing they are owed as the original occupants of this continent.' Today, strong leadership is needed in this parliament to facilitate the constitutional recognition of our

                  First Australians
                 </a>
                 . After Mabo, native title and the Apology, it is now time for constitutional recognition. Without strong leadership, constitutional change will not happen, but it must. It is the next step on the journey towards reconciliation.

                 Madam Speaker, I also wish to share the story of the Chewton Monster Meeting. As you know, Chewton is part of the Bendigo electorate and has a place in our democratic history. In 1852 15,000 gold diggers gathered in protest over the gold licence. Diggers met under their new flag, a bundle of sticks tied together as a symbol of their united strength, a pick and a shovel—symbols of their labour—the scales of justice, and a kangaroo and an emu—two animals that cannot take a step backwards—as apt symbols of their new land.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This was the first such public protest in Australia and was the first step towards democracy. That is why I claim democracy started in Bendigo. Every year history enthusiasts and Chewton locals re-enact the Monster Meeting. Last year I played the role of Mr Potts who said: 'But remember that the union is strength, that though a single twig may be bent or broken a bundle of them tied together yields not nor breaks.' The union is strength. As early as 1852 workers in the Bendigo electorate acknowledged that their strength lied within the union.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also share here the story of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
                  John Arthur
                 </a>
                 , who was the third federal member for Bendigo. Prior to entering parliament John Arthur was a representative of the agricultural implement makers and union in the Harvester dispute before Justice Higgins in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In 1907 Justice Higgins handed down the Harvester judgement which provided the basis for setting the minimum wage in Australia until the 1990s. The legal requirement for the basic wage was it 'must be enough to support a wage earner and their family in reasonable and frugal comfort'.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are some in this chamber and in the Senate who would say that what was good for working Australians in the early 1900s is not good for working Australians today. Some go as far as to say that people should have the option of working for less than the minimum wage if it means getting a job, but these people are wrong. In fact, today's minimum wage is too low and is forcing too many low-paid workers and their families into poverty. Before those on the other side scream, 'perhaps it's because these people are living beyond their means and are over-extended', let me share another story.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jacki Petts is a full-time cleaner who works hard cleaning a shopping centre. Jacki does not live in the biggest house nor in the most expensive part of town. She is a modest and humble person who always likes to remind me of where my place is. By the time Jacki has paid her car, her mortgage and her bills there is very little left on which to live in modest comfort.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How fair has our society become if working people cannot afford to pay their bills? It is only reasonable that these hard-working people expect our economy to deliver them a living wage and a secure job that they can count on. But a secure job is fast becoming a dream for many workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I acknowledge Marie Angrilli, who is in the gallery today. Marie worked last night, is here today and will return home tonight to work her shift. I thank you Marie for making the effort to be here with me today. Marie's story is one of the best examples I have to highlight the unfairness of insecure work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Marie and I first met in 2006. Granted, I had to visit her at her home. But catching Marie at home was a challenge. Marie works two part-time jobs to make a full-time job. She is up at 2.30 am to start work at 4 am. She finishes job 1 at 8 am and returns home. She leaves home for job 2 at 3 pm and starts work at 4 pm. It is finish by 8 pm and return home just after 9 pm, only to be up and do it all again at 2.30 am. Marie has not had a decent night's sleep in decades. This arrangement is not secure work that she or others can count on. Leadership and action is needed. Governments, industry, workers and their unions need to continue to come together to rebuild secure employment and jobs that we can count on.

                 I have dedicated most of my working life to standing up for working people and their families, initially by working for the union movement and now as a member of parliament. I am a proud United Voice member.

                <p>
                 I come from a working-class family, with working-class values and a healthy respect for hard work. I am the daughter of Labor people. I fondly remember Paul Keating and Labor's 1993 'true believers' victory. That night in my family home was a bit like Christmas. There was joy and champagne.

                 No matter where we are in the world, in my family phone calls are received on birthdays, Christmas, Easter and election nights. Politics is integral to our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Whilst Labor values were instilled at an early age, for most of my childhood my parents were self-employed. After struggling to pay a mortgage and support a young family, they took a chance and bought a small business. Like many other small business owners, they essentially bought themselves a job. Working long hours was just a fact of life. I spent many Saturdays and summer holidays helping my family until I got my first job—and excitement to work for somebody else.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This story is not uncommon in the Bendigo electorate where many small business owners are not small business owners by choice; they have bought themselves a job rather than face unemployment.
                </p>

                 </a>
                 workers and sole traders is further evidence of this. Cleaners, security guards, call centre workers, even our posties, are often told: 'If you want a job, get an ABN and we'll contract you.' So our low-paid employees of the past are quickly becoming our low-paid contractors of today, with no job security, work cover, superannuation or paid leave entitlements. I believe that it is the role of government to reduce the number of employees who are being forced to become contractors instead of working for a boss.

                 My family values education. I was the first in my family to enrol at university, followed by my two sisters and my mother. At the age of 43, my mother returned to study, completing her undergraduate degree, then her honours and then her PhD. Today she is an academic at the University of Canberra.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To me, she embodies the Labor passion for education and that it is an opportunity for life-long learning. Education is the key that opens the door to opportunity. Accessible to all, regardless of income, ethnicity and location, public education has served our nation well. We are a rich nation that can afford to educate all of our people. 'I give a Gonski' and will continue to advocate strongly for our public education system.

                 In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the many people who have supported and encouraged me along the way. First to the Bendigo electorate office team of Shaun, Jacki, Elly, Fabian and Bill: thank you. Together, as a team, we will serve the people of our electorate well and will work hard to make a difference.
