        Mr Speaker, I rise tonight for two reasons. First, in accordance with standing order 207, I present a petition to you and to members of this House.

       </p>
       <p>
        This has been a critical issue in the electorate. I have received hundreds of pieces of correspondence and met with many locals who have been inconvenienced by the decision of Australia Post to close their post office in Whitehorse Road, Balwyn. They have told me that this is not part of a rationalisation of their post offices—because I know that many in this House in their own electorates have seen community post offices suffer a similar fate. But, that being said, we really do need in this bustling shopping strip a post office that will stand alone. Therefore, while the newsagency in Whitehorse Road, Balwyn, has been turned into a community post office and is providing some services, this is not enough. We will bring every pressure to bear on Australia Post to open a new stand-alone post office, and I think this is a critical issue to the people of Kooyong.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other issue I want to briefly raise in the time allowed to me is the future of school funding under this government—in particular, funding for non-government and Catholic schools. Kooyong is an educational metropolis. We have over 50 schools, both public and non-public. Over 30,000 school students every day go to school in Kooyong. It is our biggest industry and our biggest asset. It is, to draw an analogy, what the car industry is to Geelong or what the wine industry is to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        . Therefore I am particularly concerned about this government's ideological preoccupation with cutting funding to non-government and Catholic schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not a new preoccupation. This is not the new Julia; this is in fact the old Julia. We do not have to think far or hard to the time when

       </p>
       <p>
        This government's decision to not guarantee the funding maintenance principle will see over 1,000 schools in Australia have their funding cut in real terms. This includes 13 schools in Kooyong:

        —13 schools, double the number of schools in Lalor. No wonder the Prime Minister does not care. And, now that it is in partnership with the Greens, we can only expect a harsher school funding proposal and principles from this government which will be to the disadvantage of all school students in Victoria and Australia.
