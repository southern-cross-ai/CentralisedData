        We are used to weather emergencies in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Indian Ocean Territories, but, once again,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">
         Mother Nature
        </a>
        has shocked us with the sudden ferocity of her power. We are reminded of how vulnerable and, at times, helpless we are in the face of the forces she can throw at us. This time we're talking about Tropical Cyclone Megan. Over the last several days, it has challenged two proud and resilient remote communities in the Lingiari electorate—first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt" rel="nofollow">
         Groote Eylandt
        </a>
        and then Borroloola.
       </p>
       <p>
        My Lingiari electorate also includes the Indian island territories of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which had already been threatened by Tropical Cyclone Anggrek. Although the cyclone ending up passing to the west, the associated severe weather has had a significant impact, particularly at Cocos. I will talk about that and a number of other issues related to the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) islands at further adjournment speeches. They need support now, as both communities have had major damage to infrastructure, and areas of land have been destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to Groote, the communities of Angurugu and Alyangula were the first in the Territory to bear the brunt of the weather front, and that was over the weekend, starting on Friday. On this occasion, there has been flooding of the mine pits and disruption of the road access between the mining lease areas and processing plant. Even more concerning is the situation at the wharf at Alyangula, where a huge transport ship has slammed into and damaged the wharf structure. The ship is carrying 41,140 metric tonnes of ore, 1,070 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel and 109 tonnes of diesel. South32 have reassured their workers and the public that remediation work will be done as soon as the weather permits and that the regular work of the mine will recommence.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the meantime, volunteers from the communities of Alyangula and Angurugu have displayed fantastic kindness and resourcefulness in difficult circumstances. Power was cut from Friday to Tuesday, and, when the water came back on, some homes were only getting it at low pressure. I want to give a big shout-out to Percy Bishop from Groote Broadcasting, who was able to muster people up and make sure that nobody went without. Supplies of food and diesel were brought in by barge and will soon address supply shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to Borroloola, it was clear that the cyclone was going to hit, and I want to pay tribute to the ever-vigilant and capable Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Murray Watt, who worked throughout the weekend and pulled together the Commonwealth side of the relief plan. This plan involved community evacuations using ADF planes. Weather conditions on Monday did not allow the planes to land, and the cyclone passed through. The amount of rain which was dumped on this remote area of the country in the course of the cyclone's movements has been enormous, and the ongoing risk is of flooding.
       </p>
       <p>
        ADF planes arranged as part of the Commonwealth contribution to the emergency response have already flown from Borroloola and taken a number of residents, together with other vulnerable citizens, to safety in Darwin. Other residents have moved to locations on higher ground, and both Borroloola and the nearby

        mine have been waiting to see how bad it is going to get.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to staff within the minister's office: Tom, Simone, Laura and all of the people who have kept the communications and information flowing. I want to give a shout-out to the police and fire and emergency services in the Northern Territory. It is tough. I also want to acknowledge my colleague Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, whose family has been seriously affected in Borroloola and who has had to go home. I want to acknowledge all of the residents, and there are three other communities—Kalkarindji/Daguragu,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_Hole" rel="nofollow">

        —who are being evacuated for the third time this year. Resilience is very low, and people are not happy, but the volume of water that has been dumped in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        I give a shout-out to everybody, including the communities. We are there and we will stand to help you.
