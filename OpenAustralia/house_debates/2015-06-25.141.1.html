       <p>
        On Wednesday 10 June I had the great pleasure of representing the Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Senator Scott Ryan, at the project opening for stage 2 of the new primary school at the Lumen Christi Catholic College in Pambula. The school is a coeducational primary and secondary college with almost 700 students. It caters to a growing demand for private, faith-based education and the coalition is proud to strongly support this choice being extended to parents in Eden-Monaro.
       </p>
       <p>
        For this project, the Australian government contributed a grant in excess of $968,000 under the capital grants program. The college, with support from the wider Catholic education system, contributed over $1.3 million. These new facilities, which include four classrooms, a meeting room, a boardroom and learning pods are a real cause for celebration. I thank the principal, Steve Centra, for hosting the opening and acknowledge his and his team's work in bringing this project to fruition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Monsignor John Woods, Episcopal Vicar of education of the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn, blessed the new rooms. Lumen Christi has a committed parent body, their College Community Council, ably led by chairperson Jenny Sheedy. Long may they and the student body live out the school motto, 'Be the Light of Christ', in Eden-Monaro.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, on Friday 12 June, it was my great pleasure to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Foundation Day
        </a>
        ceremony at Snowy Mountains Grammar School in Jindabyne. Foundation Day is an important milestone each year, where the school shows its gratitude for the wisdom and commitment demonstrated by those who contributed to the establishment of the school, which will complete 20 years of education at the conclusion of the school year.
       </p>
       <p>
        School Captains Bellamie Hansen and

        and Jim Crocker regaled the audience with a brief description of working life in the maintenance section of that organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the address by Principal Bell, I presented this fine school with an Australian flag that has flown in this House of Representatives. The senior singers then performed a very good version of
        <i>
         Man in the Mirror
        </i>
        , and this was backed up by an equally enjoyable
        <i>
         Titanium
        </i>
        by the secondary girls vocal ensemble.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulation to the various recipients of school awards, including Daniel Ternes-Dixon of year 6 and Sean Richards of year 12, for the junior and senior esprit de corps, or heart and spirit award. Thank you to Snowy Mountains Grammar school for letting me share your celebration of establishment, growth and achievement.
