         I thank the member for Wills for his question. I know these are issues that he is deeply committed to and that matter a lot to his constituents. I'm very proud to be part of a government that's committed to changing the tenor of our national debate on refugees, as we also ensure that our policies make a practical difference to the lives of refugees and to the communities that we welcome them into.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government understands that a successful humanitarian program must consider the entire settlement journey of a refugee. From the point when someone steps off a plane in Australia for the first time to gaining secure employment, we're dedicated to making sure that our newest Australians are able to rebuild their lives not just in safety but with stability and security so that they can fulfil their potential and make the contribution to communities that is so desperately needed and that is so important to each one of those entrants.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also believe in the power of a strong community sponsorship model, and I acknowledge that that's something that's shared across this chamber. I believe that's something we all support. Critically, we are committed to making this additional to the government refugee intake. We know that, through harnessing the enthusiasm and the generosity of the Australian community, we are able to match
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
          UNHCR

         referred refugees with local community groups who provide extraordinary wraparound support, practical and in-kind support and settlement integration support, including through lots of help with finding housing, navigating the journey towards schooling for children, work and learning English.
        </p>
        <p>
         From Gosford to Wonthaggi, we've seen families welcomed with open arms by their sponsors and wider communities, who are helping them navigate the journey into Australian society and helping them to participate more quickly and fully in their communities and the economy. I'm so pleased that many of these entrants are already participating in the labour market. I'm also pleased that we have programs that support this journey in becoming more complete, recognising that, whilst entrants who come through humanitarian pathways are highly motivated to work, they face unique barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why this week I was pleased to make a number of announcements supporting social enterprises, including with my friend the member for Sydney and also the member for Macnamara at Parliament on King, an extraordinary venue, where I announced $7.5 million in funding to Victorian social enterprises, ensuring that people who come here through humanitarian pathways get every opportunity to make their contribution at wonderful places like Space2b in

         , which has provided a pathway to secure employment for 95 per cent of the refugees who come through there, including through its onsite cafe. This cafe is run by Nayran, a person currently on a
