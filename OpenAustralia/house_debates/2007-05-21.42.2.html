        My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would like the foreign minister to brief the House on his discussions today with the visiting foreign minister of Iraq. What reaction has the minister received regarding today’s talks?

        <p>
         First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his interest and say how delighted I am to have my friend Foreign Minister Zebari in Australia today. I think it is his first visit as a foreign minister, but of course we have known each other for quite some years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The foreign minister is a representative of a democratic government. Iraq is one of the bastions of democracy in the world and we are delighted to have that country as a member of the family of democracies in spite of the difficulties that it is enduring. The minister made it very clear that he strongly values the support of Australia for Iraq and Australia’s support is deeply appreciated by the vast majority of the Iraqi people. We obviously agreed that the stakes in Iraq are high—high for the Iraqi people first and foremost, for their freedom and for the integrity of the country. The stakes are very high for the stability of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Iraq’s disintegration would cause a catastrophe. We agreed that Iraq’s survival and stability is important to global security. Iraq must not become a safe haven for terrorism or be a place from which terrorists can export death. The foreign minister and I agreed that Iraq is undoubtedly facing a difficult situation that requires resolve and effort. This is not a time to give up. That is the view of the Australian government, that is the view of the Iraqi government and it is the view of many people.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Security_Plan" rel="nofollow">
          Baghdad Security Plan
         </a>
         , as it is sometimes called, or the surge, was discussed and the minister made it clear that although it is not at this stage complete there is a clear-eyed road map for success and there are some positive signs—for example, a drop in sectarian violence. But that is not to underestimate of course the continuation of the violence that is taking place in Iraq. I highlight in particular the endeavours since the implementation of the Baghdad Security Plan by al-Qaeda to create as much chaos and havoc as it possibly can by murdering people, and in large numbers. These are early days for the Baghdad Security Plan; it is still very difficult. But there is a determination on the part of some of us to ensure that those people do not win.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again underline the view expressed by me to the foreign minister—and I know that the Prime Minister and other ministers who have and will meet with him will reiterate these words—using the words of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Blair
         </a>
         , ‘We should not walk away or give in; we should stand by the people of Iraq.’ We are prepared to do that. I explained to the minister that this is a controversial issue in Australia, as it is—it is not unusual—in many countries. But, in the end, when people think about this issue and put aside their personal, partisan positions, they need to think about where they ultimately want to see Iraq. What do people believe is going to be a good outcome for Iraq and for the people of Iraq and the Middle East? To put it the other way around, those people who think we should just give up—and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition is one of them—need to ask themselves whether they honestly think it would be preferable for sectarian conflict and al-Qaeda in Iraq to succeed. Do they really think that would be good for the Iraqi people? Do they think it would be good for the Middle East for Iraq to disintegrate into total violence and chaos and to become a base for al-Qaeda? Do they think that would be good? Do they think it would be good for global security if Iraq became a base for al-Qaeda operations around the world? Our answer to those questions is no. We think what would be good for Iraq would be greater stability—and greater stability built on the pillars of democracy. We wish the minister well during his visit and we have been delighted to host that visit.
