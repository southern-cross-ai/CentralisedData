       <p>
        I rise today to speak on the importance of social inclusion in our communities, and I would like to mention the important work being done through the Touched by Olivia Foundation, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBO" rel="nofollow">
         TBO
        </a>
        , by John and Justine Perkins, Olivia's parents, in my electorate of Lindsay.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Sunday, TBO will open its first Livvi's Place in my community, in the new suburb of Jordan Springs. It will house an adult sized changing space, accessible trampolines, accessible parking and many accessible features that kids and adults with varying ability can access, play on and be included with. This is even more special to me given that I began this project as a humble and committed volunteer and community driver over five years ago, and my son, who was my inspiration to getting active on this project, will speak at the opening.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the support of Lendlease,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the community of volunteers and donors, this project has come to fruition. We are lucky to have a local council and councillors that support accessibility throughout our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, I would like to mention the social inclusion provided by NADO in supporting people in my community who have a disability. I commend them on their recent achievement of securing the NADO car, which has been generously contributed to by many local businesses. I thank them for their support: Complete Recruitment Solutions, Reimer Winter Williamson Lawyers, Andrew and the One Agency Reeves Properties team,

        The car will enable people with a disability to attend and access many social and community events that they would otherwise be excluded from.
