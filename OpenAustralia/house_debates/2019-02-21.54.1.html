        I rise to inform the parliament of the tragic passing of Dr Hoang Van Nguyen, who yesterday, sadly, lost his life to a sudden heart attack. Dr Nguyen was born on 26 August 1961 in Vietnam and came to Australia to study medicine and chemistry at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        , graduating in 1987. He was not only a highly respected and accomplished doctor; he was also a passionate advocate and campaigner for human rights, particularly for those still suffering in communist Vietnam. He served as a former vice-president of the Vietnamese Community in Australia Queensland Chapter, serving two terms, and has always been an active supporter of the international Youth Human Rights Movement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was only a short time ago—a matter of weeks—that I stood side by side with Dr Nguyen at one of the many freedom rallies he helped organise to fight for justice for the Vietnamese people. And it was only as recently as last Saturday that Hoang and the Vietnamese community gathered to raise funds to help people who had been taken as prisoners of conscience in Vietnam. He was never scared to fight for justice and the truth. His legacy will live on as we continue that fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Nguyen was also a loving family man and leaves behind his wife, Kim Eun Young, and his much loved older sister, my dear friend Phuong Nguyen, and a wide extended family. Doctor Nguyen, thank you for everything you have done for not only our local Vietnamese community but also the Vietnamese community throughout Brisbane and those who are still suffering today. We will continue to fight for justice in your name. I commit to that today. In your name, I'll keep fighting for Vietnamese people in my community, in Australia and in Vietnam.
