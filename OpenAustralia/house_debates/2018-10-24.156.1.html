       <p>
        I rise to speak on Labor's Fair Go Action Plan and what a positive impact this will have in my electorate of Richmond, on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        North Coast. The fact is locals in my region and, indeed, across Australia have had enough of chaos of the Abbot-Turnbull-Morrison governments and are calling out for a united and stable government. They are calling out for a government that delivers for them and for their families and they want a future built on fairness, and it is only Labor that can deliver it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, all they've got now is this arrogant Liberal-National government which is so out of touch with Australians. After five long years of the cuts, chaos and crisis of this government, the people in my region know they've been abandoned by the Liberal-National party. Their hopes and aspirations are pushed aside while this government's infighting consumes them. In the past few weeks we have seen again the National Party talking about themselves and who leads them rather than focusing on the needs of regional and rural Australians. People in the regions have quite rightly walked away from the National Party because they don't protect their interests and they don't fight for them at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here we have the situation with the cost of living increasing and wages failing to keep up, combined with the cuts to health, aged care and education. People in my electorate are especially hurting. So many frontline services have been cut by the National Party on the north coast at both federal and state levels. This is why we need a stable and steady Labor government to get the economy working for people again. Make no mistake about it: Labor is and will always be the only party that can actually deliver fairness. Only Labor has pledged an action plan to deliver a fair go to everyday working Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our fair go plan focuses on a number of policy measures that will help people living on the north coast. Firstly, we will fix our schools and hospitals by restoring funding cut by the Liberals and Nationals to ensure our community has quality public schools and hospitals. In our hospitals there will be much greater investment in our doctors and nurses and more beds for patients. Our recent announcement will deliver an extra $14 billion for public schools over the next decade, with $3.3 billion flowing in the first three years alone. Labor's plan will also ease pressure on family budgets by ending the Medicare freeze and giving important tax breaks to workers. We'll also better regulate power prices, with a new regulated cap protecting families and small businesses from price gouging by big energy companies. And, as always, Labor will stand up for the workers by protecting penalty rates, which are so vital in an area like mine with many people working in industries that do get penalty rates. They need to be protected. Only Labor will do that. Also, Labor will invest in cheaper, cleaner energy by delivering 50 per cent renewables by 2030—a major move.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fundamentally, Labor wants to build a strong economy that starts working for all of us. The choice for my community on the north coast is very clear. Locals know the cuts, chaos and misery the National Party leaves behind every time they are in government. They have abandoned the north coast and, in fact, they've abandoned governing at all. In contrast to all of this, Labor stands united and stable, and we're fighting for a fair go for all Australians—a fair go that will make a very big difference in the lives of people living on the New South Wales north coast in my electorate. People are calling for fairness, and it's only Labor that will deliver a fair go. That's our pledge: a fair go for all Australians. It'll make a major difference to people living in my area on the New South Wales north coast.

         Earlier this month, club members, flag officers and dignitaries were greeted with a sunny morning for the official opening of the Brighton Yacht Club season. In attendance was the Bayside/

         , to officially open the season along with Father Bill Goldman, who performed a blessing of the fleet. Thank you to Mandy Jackson's Nutrimetics and

         </a>
         for providing prizes to the all-in-pursuit race winner Laura Harding and her ring-in crew. Special thanks go to Kate Jenkins as lead organiser of the day and to Bruno Carreto, who organised the catering and entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to wish the flag officers and general committee well for the summer: Commodore Paul Pascoe, Vice Commodore Peter Strain, Rear Commodore Peter Coleman, Club Captain Paul Jenkins, Honorary Treasurer Peter Demura and general committee members Brett Heath, Catherine Hurley, James Leckey, Marnie Irving, Niesje Hees and Steve Ingram.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, I want to acknowledge the Beaumaris Motor Yacht Squadron, who also kicked off their boating season, with their 59th annual sail past. It looks set to be another successful year of promoting recreational boating and providing a social environment for cruising, nav rallies and fishing for Beaumaris residents and beyond. I would like to acknowledge the BMYS office bearers: Commodore David Bell, Vice Commodore and Boating Director Les Sabo, Rear Commodore Michael Busuttil, Finance Director Hein Preller, Site Director Shayne Benedict, Fishing Director Brendon Hocking, Social Director John Giuliano, Club Secretary Simon Bartaby and Past Commodore Ross Popplewell.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am also looking forward to attending and joining Commodore Gary Lokum for the opening day at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rock_Yacht_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Black Rock Yacht Club

         this weekend. Best wishes to the Black Rock Yacht Club committee for the upcoming season: Vice Commodore Lara Blasse, Commodore Mark Taylor, Immediate Past Commodore Mark Taylor, Secretary Mark Jackson, Treasurer Gary McLennan, Sailing Captain Andre Blasse and Rear Commodore Nik Wallis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, who could forget the mighty Sandringham Yacht Club? I trust all of their club members were well in their launch only a couple of weeks ago, which I wasn't able to attend, because I was out supporting other community events. I trust club members and visitors will be in good hands this summer with this important leadership, particularly Commodore Ashley Trebilcock; Vice Commodore Garry Anderson; Rear Commodore Sue Bowes; sail club captains

        </p>
        <p>
         All of these sailing clubs and yacht clubs play a critical part in the Goldstein social infrastructure to make sure that, at all stages of life, people are able to engage in healthy activities, outdoor activities, using the beauty and the natural asset that is
