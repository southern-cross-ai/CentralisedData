       <p>
        I rise today to share with the House an initiative in my electorate that I found incredibly impressive. Last week I met members of the Rainbow Club. This is a swimming club run by parents and designed to teach children with autism to swim.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an absolute pleasure to visit the swimming pool and to meet the president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Morgan" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Morgan
        </a>
        . Steve founded the Rainbow Club after having previously founded Basecamp 3030, which was a philanthropically funded respite care service for families living with disabilities in Wyndham. He later hired a private swim instructor to help teach his autistic son, Cory, to become more 'drown proof'.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know there are many families who have these fears and that those fears can be more acute for families with children who have a disability. I take my hat off to Steve Morgan for his inspired action in our community. He began by getting a swim instructor to teach his own son. By the second lesson there were two other students involved and now they have 17 teachers, teaching more than 100 children, three days a week, year round. This is an important piece of work run by parents, for parents. Being involved allows the children to learn to swim and it allows the parents to form a community group. They have plans for the future to expend their work.
