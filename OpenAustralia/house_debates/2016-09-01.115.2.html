        One of the greatest things about representing my community is their respect for our shared history. That respect is exemplified by a group of people in the Parramatta area who are working to develop a memorial in the Parramatta district that recognises the contribution of Indigenous service personnel. The committee is in experienced and capable hands, being led by former councillor Phil Russo and our former

        Together they are working towards their worthy goal of raising $200,000 dollars by mid-2017, with a view to dedicating the memorial by 11 November 2018. They have set their sights high and are working hard to reach their target. Since 2014, the committee has been determined to address community ignorance and at times antipathy towards the Indigenous people who have served our country with distinction since 1901. This recognition is long overdue. The memorial will be dedicated to proud first Australians, Australians who in 1903 were exempt from military service because they were not of European descent but who enlisted anyway in quite large numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not until 1949 that these restrictions were lifted. These were Australians who, at the outbreak of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        , enlisted like thousands of others to do what they saw as their patriotic duty. The best guess estimate is that over 1,000 Indigenous men listed, although the figure is probably much higher as only their physical descriptions were noted. That was 1,000 people out of 93,000 Australians in 1901, according to the best available figures. They were at times rejected because their race and in 1915 it became harder to enlisted. People travelled hundreds of kilometres to enlist after being turned down in their own communities.
       </p>

        They were heroes like Private Richard Gunn, who listed his birthplace as Dunedin in

       </p>
       <p>
        The memorial will provide recognition and remembrance for Defence Force members who began as group of five in the

        The committee is currently negotiating with administrators in the City of Parramatta Council, who are keen supporters of the project. The council have engaged an arts consultant, who has identified six artists who will submit concept designs for the memorial. The winning artist will be selected by the committee with the assistance of a public art expert. The memorial will increase cultural awareness and understanding from casual observers, family members and serving and retired service personnel.

        It will provide a site for up to 200 community members to participate in formal services, including Anzac Day,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">

        Week. It will also offer a place for reflection and an opportunity to show respect for our fallen brothers and sisters. While the group is still identifying a site, it is envisaged that the memorial will be situated in a high-volume area that is close to the CBD. I wish the committee well in their endeavours with the knowledge that the overwhelming support of the community is with them. Their work is long overdue, and I thank them.
