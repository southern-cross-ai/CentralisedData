        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today, the former Prime Minister has shirt-fronted the current Prime Minister over his lack of economic leadership. Will the current Prime Minister take up the former Prime Minister's challenge and rule out retrospective changes to negative gearing?

          I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to respond. The question actually relates to the different positions, apparently. But let me talk about the different positions on that side of the House because, 12 months ago,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Faine" rel="nofollow">
           Jon Faine
          </a>
          asked the Leader of the Opposition: 'Yes or no? Would you, in some way, wind back negative gearing?' And the Leader of the Opposition said, 'That policy is not on our radar.' Then, nine months ago, when asked the same question, he said, 'Negative gearing changes are not the focus of the Labor Party.' He said, again, nine months ago, 'We have said all matters need to be on the table for discussion, but it is not our focus or on our radar to scrap negative gearing.' Now that is fair enough. That is what he said nine months or 12 months ago, and that, apparently, was the position of the opposition on negative gearing. So, funnily enough, just 2½ weeks ago, when the member for McMahon was asked about negative gearing, he said—and this was after they had announced their catastrophic, market-destroying changes—'We've been working on our policy for 18 months!' He forgot to tell the Leader of the Opposition. They are the 'Bib and Bob' of basket cases when it comes to policies on negative gearing. What those opposite do not understand on negative gearing is that mums and dads are investing in property for their own future. One of the things that those mums and dads are doing is that they are investing—

              It would seem, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition is on a need-to-know basis when it comes to their policy. But I cannot call them policies, because all they are announcing is higher taxes. That is all we are getting from that side. They camouflage policy as putting their hand deep into the pockets of mum and dad investors who are simply trying to get ahead. The point I was going to make is: who do they think is investing in properties that go into Defence Housing Australia's pool—that are actually providing properties for our servicemen and servicewomen. For mums and dads investing in negative gearing, private investors account for more than 70 per cent of the properties in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
               DHA
              </a>
              housing pool. But, interestingly, over 3,000 defence men and women are those who are investing in negative gearing, and they have an average net rental loss of some $9,300. Those opposite may want to think that these investors are the problem, but we on this side know that they are the ones who are supporting the successful transition in our economy that this side of the House knows how to manage.
