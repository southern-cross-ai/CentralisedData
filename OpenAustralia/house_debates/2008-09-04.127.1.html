       <p>
        I rise to speak on a matter that is close to my heart—a program that I have been a strong advocate of, and extremely proud of, throughout my time in parliament—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Corps" rel="nofollow">
         Green Corps
        </a>
        . Green Corps is a popular and innovative scheme which allows young people aged between 17 and 20 to demonstrate their commitment to preserving and restoring Australia’s environment and heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government introduced the program, honouring its 1996 election commitment. Since that time the program has had great success not only in my electorate of Canning but throughout the country. More than 18,000 participants have planted more than 14 million trees, erected 8,000 kilometres of fencing, removed 50,000 hectares of weeds and conducted more than 5,000 surveys encouraging community groups into environmental projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is one of Labor’s worst-kept secrets that it plans to axe this program. Following the government’s earlier announcement that it would abolish the $291 per week allowance for participants and extend eligibility to all age groups, this week the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations confirmed that Green Corps would not continue as a separate program. The government has been trying to keep its plans off the radar, but Labor cannot continue to spout its ‘green credentials’ while it slashes environmental funding and axes programs which so clearly make a difference. Actions speak louder than words, Mr Rudd.
       </p>
       <p>
        Considering that around 75 per cent of Green Corps projects have been based in rural and regional areas, this is just another slap in the face to country Australia from a city-centric government. One of the major success factors for Green Corps is the involvement of the local community in activities. Projects are community based and involve multiple partners from the community as well as state, territory and local governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only a month ago I attended the graduation ceremony of participants in what was called the Youth, Riffles, Rapids and Riparian Planting in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Inlet" rel="nofollow">
         Peel Inlet
        </a>
        Green Corps project. This team completed a wide range of activities to help develop and improve the biodiversity of the Peel Inlet. Pinjarra’s growth has had a direct impact on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
         Murray River
        </a>
        and, with input from local environmental groups and the support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Murray
        </a>
        , rehabilitation strategies including weed control, baffle boarding and planting of local species were implemented by this team. Congratulations to the team leader, Emma, and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greening_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Greening Australia
        </a>
        for their great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Participants gain accreditation in conservation and land management—they get to certificate I level and they can go on from there—horticulture, first aid and occupational health and safety. But the program provides far greater skills to young Australians then practical horticultural skills. Green Corps is not just about planting trees; in many cases the experience helps shape a direction for these young people and gives them the confidence they need to get ahead in life and their future careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Canning, Green Corps participants have completed some outstanding environmental projects, such as the Fairbridge heritage and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dandalup_River" rel="nofollow">
         South Dandalup River
        </a>
        restoration project, which involved the conservation of declared rare flora and the refurbishment of Newton Cottage, which had unique shingling. Another was the Peel Harvey rehabilitation project, where local native species were planted, and the team constructed pathways, boardwalks and a viewing platform at Lake Geogorup. In another project, a team working at South Yunderup helped rehabilitate South Yunderup’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Park
        </a>
        and address the degradation of riverbanks caused by boating. Another project, the Serpentine-Jarrahdale Heritage Park project, involved trail construction to facilitate access to Gooralong Brook and improvements to Jarrahdale’s heritage-listed Mill Managers House.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have met most of the graduates from the projects I mentioned, and an increasing number of Indigenous people are now involved. I know many of them have gone on to further training and some have taken employment in the horticulture field. I have heard nothing but good stories and outcomes from this program and I believe that it is an absolute travesty that this highly successful program will be trashed under the Rudd Labor government.
