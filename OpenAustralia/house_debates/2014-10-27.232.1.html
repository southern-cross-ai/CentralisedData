        is immensely proud of its sporting talent and achievements. Dobell is home to a strong sporting community. The people of Dobell have a passion for sport which is evidenced in the many outstanding achievements of our sports men and women. From the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Mariners
        </a>
        , champions of the A-League, to our local sporting champions, our sports stars of tomorrow, the Central Coast has an array of sports men and women who excel on the domestic and international stages.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a mother of two young rugby union players, I have experienced the joy of watching your child take to the field and give their best to the game. I also know that sport has the unique quality of uniting communities. When players take to the field and when families watch in the stands, we transcend the barriers that at other times divide us. We should always celebrate the things in life that bring us together and unite us.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Dobell, I have had the pleasure of getting to know many local players and the people behind our local sporting clubs. From rugby union to cricket, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Aussie Rules
        </a>
        to swimming, from league to equestrian—and everything in between—we have much to be proud of. Being involved in sport provides a sense of community and self-worth and, importantly, leads to active and healthy lifestyles. I want to see more people provided opportunity to engage and excel in sport. In order to provide these opportunities, it is important that we support our local sporting clubs and ensure that appropriate infrastructure is made available.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why I am determined and committed to deliver the Tuggerah Sporting Precinct, which will enable the hosting of regional and national sporting tournaments as well as relieve pressure on pre-existing local sports infrastructure. The development of this precinct would place the Central Coast as a strong contender to become the sports tourism capital of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as well as promote growth in tournaments such as the Central Coast Rugby Sevens and Oztag championships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Held over this past weekend, the Central Coast Rugby Sevens is Australia's premier rugby sevens tournament outside the international world series. The tournament featured international, national and club champions from Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , Fiji, Canada, Brazil, Malaysia, Japan and the United States. Tournament director,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Morgan" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Morgan
        </a>
        , has worked hard to promote equality between the men's and women's tournaments and, as a result, the women's tournament featured one of the richest women's rugby tournaments in the world. This year, I was honoured to be appointed ambassador for the women's tournament. I am proud to advocate the need for equality in sport. Such is the significance of tournaments such as the Central Coast Rugby Sevens, I was privileged to welcome the Prime Minister to officially open this year's competition. I hope that we can bring more tournaments of this size to the Central Coast not only to encourage international talent to Australian shores but also to promote the Central Coast as a choice destination for sporting competitions. This will see a strong and prosperous tourism industry develop to underpin continued economic growth and job development. This year's Central Coast Rugby Sevens also provided an opportunity for local sporting talent to compete against international stars. One of the most appealing elements of the tournament was the opportunity for locals to showcase their skills and talent in front of national selectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The more we can encourage competitions of this calibre the greater the opportunity for local sports champions to be discovered. Every weekend local sporting participants take to our fields and demonstrate their talents, often dreaming of one day wearing our revered coat of arms and representing this great nation. Over the past year, I have had the pleasure of assisting these local sportsmen and sportswomen through the federal government's Local Sporting Champions program. This program has assisted many young sporting champions take part in overseas and interstate competitions. Many of these young sportspeople will no doubt follow in the footsteps of Central Coast sporting legends such as Olympic boxer Jai Opetaia, rugby league player

        It is not only our local sporting champions that are excelling on the world stage. In dance, Danielle Muir of Ourimbah has achieved a most outstanding ballet milestone. Danielle started dancing at age 2½ with Marni's Studio of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_Arts" rel="nofollow">
         Performing Arts
        </a>
        on the Central Coast. Through hard work and dedication she was one of only 16 girls worldwide to be offered a position at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ballet_School" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Ballet School
        </a>
        in London. Danielle commenced at the Royal Ballet School, aged 16, in September 2010 and graduated with honours in July 2013. She auditioned for the world renowned Staatsballett company in Berlin. Over 200 girls auditioned, and she was one of only two to be offered a contract. Danielle is the first Australian ever to be offered a contract with the company. Danielle has quietly gone about her outstanding career with the love and support of her family. Her ultimate goal is to be a principal ballerina. I wish her well in achieving this goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        These local and upcoming stars—like Danielle—have reached this stage in their aspiring careers with the strong support of family, friends, coaches, mentors and volunteers. The role of family and volunteers in grassroots sport can never be overstated. From keeping score to manning the barbecue or washing the team kits, volunteers' time is every bit as important as the performance on the field. I remember fondly many weekends spent at Warnervale and Woongarrah ovals with members of the Warnervale Wildcats family. As well as being a supportive mother, I found myself helping in the running of the club. This is not a unique situation. It is shared by mums, dads, grandparents and communities Australia-wide. We do it to support our children and for love of our community. We are rewarded through on-field triumphs and the satisfaction of the young men and women who put it all on the line in the name of their beloved local club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ethan Milne, secretary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         The Entrance
        </a>
        District Cricket Club, exemplifies the commitment of a volunteer within a sporting club. A dedicated, community minded individual, Ethan is also a member of Surf Life Saving Central Coast. Not only is young Ethan professional in his approach, he has actively sought to improve his club by successfully applying on behalf of The Entrance team and players for several grants. All levels of government are strong supporters of local sport. However, without the outstanding work of volunteers like young Ethan our grants and funding would not deliver the benefits to sporting communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        My love for local sports and the pride it brings to us as a community has not wavered since being elected to parliament. I am grateful to The Entrance District Cricket Club, the Warnervale Wildcats Cricket Club, the Warnervale Wildcats Rugby Club and the Woongarrah Wildcats Football Club, who have invited me to become patron.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only do our local sporting clubs excel on the field they also play a strong role in our community by supporting and giving to worthwhile causes. The Warnervale Rugby Club earlier this season hosted a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dog_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Black Dog Institute
        </a>
        fundraiser: a day where the club turned orange to support the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. This is an example of the contribution of local sports clubs that extends beyond the sports fields and into the broader community. I have often spoken of the number of Central Coast residents who commute out of our region for employment. Unfortunately many of these parents are unable to transport their children to and from sports training. As a result many children experience difficulty in accessing sport. The federal government's Active After-school Communities provides primary school children with access to free sport participation after school. In Dobell alone this program provides over 5½ thousand annual placements. Not only does the program engage children in sport through a positive and fun experience, it also allows children with both parents working or commuting the opportunity to participate in a local sport. Earlier this year I attended the Soccer5s school cup which included students from over 10 schools on the Central Coast. Through the work of the Active After-school Communities these students were able to participate in Soccer5s in a fun, safe and friendly environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another local organisation providing additional support to tomorrows sports stars is the Central Coast Academy of Sport. Founded in 2004, the academy is a non-profit sporting organisation that exists to provide locally based sports-development opportunities for athletes, coaches, officials and administrators on the Central Coast. Overseen by academy director, Mr Ian Robilliard, the academy offers a total of 15 high-performance sporting programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I had the privilege of attending the inaugural Women in Sports Luncheon hosted by the Central Coast Sports Federation. The Central Coast Sports Federation for many years has been considered the voice of sport for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Central Coast
        </a>
        . President of the federation, Mr Kevin Dewar, has been a strong advocate for the development and advancement of sport on the Central Coast for the benefit of Central Coast sporting organisations, facilities and community wellbeing and fitness. Both Kevin and Ian have been strong supporters of the need for new sporting infrastructure on the Central Coast and have accompanied me in advocating the need for the Tuggerah Sporting Precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pride of sport on the Central Coast is embodied within the Central Coast Mariners, who for 10 years have been a perennial force in the A-League competition. Often dismissed as the underdog to Sydney powerhouses Sydney
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC" rel="nofollow">
         FC
        </a>
        and the Western Sydney Wanderers, the Central Coast Mariners have consistently punched above their weight and demonstrated the strength of the Central Coast community. In their 10th year the Mariners will again call upon the support of Central Coast locals as they challenge their second A-League championship. I look forward to joining them as they demonstrate that the Central Coast is a force to be reckoned with in Australian football. From the Mariners to the local football club I am immensely proud of the sporting achievements of Central Coast locals and look forward to sharing their continuing success with the House.
