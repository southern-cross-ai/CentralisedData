        ) ( ): Like some of my colleagues, I rise to speak of the inadequacy of the current government and, particularly, the current Prime Minister's work when it comes to growing our nation. Whether it be renewables or developing the North, there is a lot left to be desired. Not one single cent has been spent on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. It is a $5 billion concessional loans scheme, and not one cent has been spent on developing our vast North.
