       <p>
        Many of my previous speeches in this place have focused on the importance of infrastructure in my peri-urban electorate of Dunkley. I came into the election with an ambitious infrastructure vision, and I have consistently fought for several major projects since to further our intercity connectivity; our importance as a regional hub for health, education and business; and to protect and foster our stunning natural environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I was first elected, in my maiden speech I said that I believe that we should govern for the outer suburbs and the country not just the inner city, and that by bringing infrastructure and services to the country and outer suburbs we can ensure people are not disadvantaged because of where they live. Investment in infrastructure helps promote equality of opportunity, a key Liberal value and an objective that is ever-present in my representation for the people of Dunkley. Investment in infrastructure brings jobs, income and resources to communities and invites people to live, study, work, build relationships and start families in the area. Its importance to a region which is the gateway to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        —in fact, I would say the hub of the Mornington Peninsula—cannot be understated. People want the best for their kids, their grandkids and their families. Such investment helps them to achieve their dreams.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Dunkley, there are a number of opportunities that I have worked to see developed and that I would love to see developed and capitalised on for the benefit of the greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula area. Improving transport infrastructure, for instance, and growing our education, health and service facilities would attract research and expertise that would benefit all of our community. This is important both locally and nationally, which is one reason I joined the coalition's infrastructure and regional development backbench committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing I recently announced—just last Friday—is the commencement of the long-awaited Oliver's Hill safe boat refuge, with a contribution from the federal government of $500,000. Stage 1 facilitates hydrological environmental studies, followed by planning and design. Stage 2 is constructing the safe boat refuge. The scope put forward by the Frankston City Council and recently signed off by the minister includes a breakwater with access on top for emergency vehicles, lighting and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        . This safe boat refuge will provide safety for small recreational craft and police boats in heavy weather and a secure, permanent mooring in two- to three-metres depth for the Frankston Volunteer Coast Guard rescue vessel. It will also benefit the water police, lifesavers, users of the Peninsula Flyboard, local fishers, boat users, tourists and local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently the coastguard launch their vessels from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson_River" rel="nofollow">
         Patterson River
        </a>
        , resulting in a much slower response time for vessels in distress, with potentially drastic outcomes for users of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip
        </a>
        and the southern area of the Peninsula. Not only is this a safety issue, but, if the coastguard and water police take up residence in Frankston, additional recreational boaters, fishers and others will follow. This is a project that has been undertaken with all due diligence with regard to the greater Frankston coastline as well as environmental preservation. The Frankston foreshore is a major attraction which receives nearly a million visitors a year and the work in planning and constructing the Oliver's Hill safe boat refuge would cater to the needs of all beach and bay users in Dunkley and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project, which is quite different but is very crucial to jobs, employment and opportunities in my electorate, is the Dunkley rail plan. The coalition federal government has contributed $4 million towards the business case of this plan. Several of my colleagues will be no doubt familiar with the extensive difficulties we've had in encouraging the state government to acknowledge the federal funding that is on the table, to engage in our process and to submit a scope. But I am pleased to now report that a revised scope for the business case was submitted by the state government, and this has now been signed off by the federal minister. We now await the important next step of the state government putting this business case out for tender, and I call on the state government to undertake this process as soon as possible. This will result in extending metro rail services from Frankston to Baxter. This will include a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Frankston Hospital
        </a>
        station, as well as a new station upgrade at Leawarra Station at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        , which is predicted to increase enrolments there by up to 20 per cent. It will also involve a new station at Langwarrin and an upgraded station at Baxter. The extent of this investment is significant because, once the business case costs and plans the different options, there is the potential for the state and the federal government to co-invest in this project. This will potentially result in a potential one per cent increase in job opportunities in my area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another area that I've been focusing on is the interlink between the Frankston Hospital and the university, which will benefit from the rail upgrades at Frankston Hospital and the university. There's huge potential with the Berwick campus of Monash University being closed and the business courses coming across to the Peninsula campus, as well as the fact we're a health hub and a business hub in our region. We have a lot of opportunity for collaboration between Frankston Hospital and the university, including with a medical degree, research and collaboration to commercialise health and medicine projects and so forth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some other things that I've been working on locally include helping young people in my electorate. I'm the youngest MP in the House of Representatives, and I'm very passionate about engaging with young people and giving young people the opportunity to participate in our community so they have opportunities for education, employment, activities and connectivity in our community. That's why I've specifically focused on investing in local sporting infrastructure in my electorate. One example is investment in the Karingal Bulls football club, who are getting $300,000 of federal funding to urgently upgrade their facilities, which were in much need of an upgrade. Another thing I have been working on locally is investment in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Green Army
        </a>
        projects, which enhance the significant environmental positives around our electorate. Things need to be cleaned and enhanced, not only for tourists but for local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm looking to the future, too. I've talked about the Baxter rail line before, but a long-term investment in rail could be the potential tri-hub connection between Frankston, Cranbourne and Dandenong. It is not only a connection between Frankston and the CBD that is important. The interhub connection between those major centres, to connect a place where people are living with the multiple places where people work, is also important. I'm interested in working with the state government on rail connections further down the Peninsula, including to places like Mornington.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also significant opportunities around a range of different modes of transport, including an intermodal hub—for example, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Port" rel="nofollow">
         Western Port
        </a>
        container port; a south-east Melbourne airport for cargo and passengers; a rail link and improved road links to Western Port; as well as fast ferry services on Port Phillip, including Mornington and Frankston. I think places like Hobart, with their fast service to Mona, do very well.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also the opportunity for a large-scale convention centre for Frankston. I think it is a missing element, when we have a beautiful natural beach, a hospital and a university there. We have an opportunity to bring in lots of people who currently go elsewhere to come for conventions, conferences and so forth. Potentially, there is an opportunity for a swimming complex for Mornington as well, with no key swimming complex currently existing between Frankston and Rosebud. Having Mornington as a key hub for that is also important. I am also looking towards investment for the upgrade of beach infrastructure from Mornington to Seaford, whether it's signage, connecting trails, paths, access and so forth.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to look to the future because the young people in our electorate, in particular, are our future. We need to invest in them to give them the best chance in life—and not only for young people but for everyone in my electorate. People want to be connected to their families. People want the opportunity for education and employment. That's particularly important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I emphasised earlier the benefits of investment in infrastructure. The cycle in investment in infrastructure, the boost to the economy, the increase in the participation of the population and the consequential advances in infrastructure are very important to promoting our status as a hub for many different sectors. That's why I'm also advocating for the decentralisation of a federal department or agency to my area, much as we've achieved at the state level with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Water" rel="nofollow">
         South East Water
        </a>
        building.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just wanted to raise some of the things that have been achieved in infrastructure and also some of the things that I want to achieve in my electorate. These are important things to advocate for in Dunkley and beyond. Thank you for the time to speak on this today.
