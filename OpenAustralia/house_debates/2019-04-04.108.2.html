         <p>
          Thank you, Mr Speaker. To the chagrin of a few and the joy of many, maybe even some in this place, I'm retiring from the Australian parliament. On 28 April 1992, I was preselected for Sturt. The opening lines of my speech were: 'In 1966, after 17 years, Sir Keith Wilson handed Sturt over to his son Ian. Now, 26 years later, it's time to change again.' Of course, I went on to win that preselection. After almost 27 years, it's time for renewal in Sturt again.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'd like to thank the Liberal Party in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          and in Sturt for giving me the opportunity to carry the Liberal banner in this seat for nine elections, for over a quarter of a century. They're a wonderful group of people.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
           The Liberal Party
          </a>
          in South Australia and nationally can be a rambunctious group of people at times, but I believe in the party and I always will. Like the member for Grayndler, I'm a team man. I just happened to go for the team that is the election-winning machine!
         </p>
         <p>
          I'd also like to thank the electors of Sturt: thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve you and the privilege of representing you. I'm confident that I leave my seat and the great state of South Australia in good shape. I'm sure that the Liberal Party's candidate—and my good friend—
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stephens" rel="nofollow">
           James Stephens
          </a>
          will retain Sturt at the coming election, and I have every confidence that the Prime Minister will lead the coalition to victory in the election in May.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to thank my dozen of staff over the years. We all know in this place that they are like a second family to us. They allow us to shine and they help pick up the pieces when we crumble a little. I'd also like to thank my family—my wife, Carolyn, and my children, Eleanor, Barnaby, Felix and Aurelia—as well as my extended family. We are a tight-knit group. My family have been with me every step of my political career. I volunteered but they were conscripted, yet they supported me willingly and graciously.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since 1993 I have been a backbencher for 10 years and a frontbencher for 16, in cabinet for six years and in the leadership group for 10, in government for 17 and in opposition for nine—which is a good balance! That places me as the longest-serving non-Labor member of the House of Representatives for South Australia since Federation. Four prime ministers have appointed me to their executives, and prime ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison chose me to be their Leader of the House. I am going to miss the stage of the dispatch box, which gives you some amateur thespianism. Some of my favourites include: 'a bloodied dagger masquerading as a speech' from the member for Grayndler'; 'I'd back the member for Corio in a fast-moving butterknife fight anytime'—I assume he won that butterknife fight; and 'I fixed it'. I thank Skye for giving me a moniker that I have not been able to shake!
         </p>
         <p>
          As Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Industry, I have been responsible for delivering the $200 billion build-up of Australia's military capability, the largest in Australia's peace time history, which, at the same time, we have used to fundamentally reshape our strategic industrial base. These are the largest Navy,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Air Force
          </a>
          , Army and cyberprojects in 75 years. And, with the other members of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           National Security Committee
          </a>
          , I created the Pacific step-up to support Australia's strategic position in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
           South Pacific
          </a>
          . Whomever follows me in this role will be the luckiest person in the government. To be a Minister for Defence in the Defence portfolio is to see Australians at their best. Our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          , and all who enable them to use their capability, are one of the greatest attributes of our country's history and our national character.
         </p>
         <p>
          Beyond the Defence portfolio, I am proud to have delivered the National Innovation and Science Agenda, to have reformed the national curriculum, to have introduced compulsory literacy and numeracy testing for Australian teaching graduates and to have expanded phonics teaching in remote schools in northern Australia with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Pearson" rel="nofollow">
           Noel Pearson
          </a>
          . But I am particularly grateful that the youth mental health initiative that I created in 2006, headspace, has gone on to thrive and become a fixture in the mental health sector.
         </p>
         <p>
          In a few weeks my political career comes to an end.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt" rel="nofollow">
           Franklin Roosevelt
          </a>
          said a long time ago:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have tried to keep that creed as my lodestar throughout my career because I have had a fortunate life. I don't have a log-cabin story like so many people in this place—although I did once have to get my own lemon for a gin and tonic! That may or may not qualify, Mr Speaker! As the psalms say: of those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have always believed that those who have had great opportunities have a responsibility to work to give others the same opportunities.
         </p>
         <p>
          Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on all sides of the House. I once described the House of Representatives as being my natural habitat; you are all my fellow species in this unnatural place! This place brings out the best in us and it brings out the worst in us. I have seen some truly dreadful people come through here over the last quarter of a century. But I have seen some many more outstanding people, including my current colleagues. Something drives us all to get here. In most cases, it is a fierce competition internally within our parties and then in the campaign. But we are driven on nonetheless because, my friends, we know, each one of us, that to get the chance to influence the society in which we live, to make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens, is worth the sacrifices. To be part of politics is to be part of history, and no-one can take that away from any one of us.
         </p>
         <p>
          For decades I have carried a little card around in my wallet that has written on it these lines that Plutarch once wrote about Pericles and the lives of the Athenians:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Virtue in action immediately takes such hold of a man that he no sooner admires a deed than he sets out to follow in the steps of the doer.
         </p>
         <p>
          We've all followed in the footsteps of great deed doers, men and women who have assisted Australians to build a great nation. As the member for Warringah is fond of saying, you win the lottery of life when you are born in Australia and everyone around the world knows it. That didn't happen by accident; it happened because of good governments and good men and women trying to do their best. I've relished the opportunity to attempt great deeds in the one forum that in our democracy allows every Australian the chance to do so, the House of Representatives. Thank you; goodbye and good luck.

          <p>
           On indulgence: for years at every election a conversation that goes through the Labor Party has been, 'Can we stop Pyne from winning Sturt?' This was not the preferred method, I have to say. The Leader of the House is someone who has always loved the parliament. There will be times when, for all of us, the debate gets vicious because the issues we are dealing with are real. But I think the Leader of the House has probably been better than almost any of us at having moments where a bit of grace and a bit of levity is thrown in. He referred to the 'stage' of this parliament. I don't think anyone sees it as a stage quite the way the Leader of the House does and I don't think anyone uses it that way. I should, quite as effectively. I should let the Leader of the House know that I had organised today—and they are still up there—the scriptwriter and cast of the play
           <i>
            How
           </i>
           <i>
            to Rule t
           </i>
           <i>
            he World
           </i>
           , which is actually set here. I thought they could treat this as an audition. There are a couple of roles for your next career that would be spot on—absolutely spot on.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because of our roles on the front-line you get people who don't know the other being deeply critical. I always respond to the Leader of the House by quoting the
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawshank_Redemption" rel="nofollow">
             Shawshank Redemption
            </a>
           </i>
           , where someone is critical of a character called Brooks and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" rel="nofollow">
            Morgan Freeman
           </a>
           responds, 'Brooks ain't no bug; he's just institutionalised.' There is also a point about the walls around us: 'First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them.' I wish you well. We really wish you well, whatever the next part of your career involves.
          </p>
          <p>
           I remember when Albo's book came out,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
            Bob Hawke
           </a>
           took great delight in quoting the Leader of the House saying, 'My only friend in the Labor Party is Albo.'
          </p>
          <p>
           An opposition member: In the parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the parliament. Now that you are leaving it will be easier to have a whole lot more. Whatever you go to next, with Albo on the show you shared with him on
           <i>
            Today
           </i>
           or the high-rating and potentially Logie-winning show of
           <i>
            Pyne and Marles
           </i>
           <i>
           </i>
           it will be a disaster for Sky for you not to be appearing on that—and wherever your career takes you, particularly if you are there at an awards night receiving a Logie or some award for a future theatrical performance, please remember that we were all there with you at the beginning. Good luck.

            I'll just make a couple of remarks. I don't want to detain the House. Christopher and I have been friends for a long, long time. Before we met, I was told that I needed to hate him. I obviously found that impossible. We became friends. We've shared a lot together over the years—the ups and downs of politics and the challenges that all of us face in here.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manager" rel="nofollow">
             The Manager
            </a>
            of Opposition Business made a very important point: through that, the member for Sturt has never lost his grace and he has certainly never lost his sense of humour, even under the most incredible pressure.
           </p>
           <p>
            You referred to Labor trying to win Sturt. In 2007, they probably had their best chance. In fact, Channel 9 shredded you on election night, didn't they? They'd put you through the shredder. The count was occurring. It was very late in the evening, after Prime Minister Howard had conceded. There were obviously mixed feelings in my electorate. My supporters were thrilled that we'd retained the seat with a strong margin but were obviously disappointed with the overall result. I think probably because of the time difference, Christopher, you rang me quite late. There were about four or five people left and we were cleaning up. I saw your name come up on the phone and I hit the speaker button and all we heard was, 'I'm alive!' I think it was about five minutes to 12. I thought, in those circumstances, that really summed it up. Congratulations. We won't be seeing you here, but your friends will see you around. We really do wish you the best in the next chapter of your life.
