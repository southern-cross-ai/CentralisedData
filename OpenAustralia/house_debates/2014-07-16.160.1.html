        I would like to take the opportunity today to highlight a number of wonderful community events in the Lindsay community. I am immensely proud to be a local member for such a wonderful, inclusive and diverse community. Firstly, the Australian Bhutanese Youth Festival held their third interstate soccer tournament in Penrith over four days commencing on 3 July. I was extremely proud to be asked to be patron of this wonderful event.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association" rel="nofollow">
         The Association
        </a>
        of Bhutanese in Australia works tirelessly to help new arrivals engage with the community, learn English and move towards full participation in the community and provide tolerance and inclusiveness. I commend the Australian Bhutanese community for this wonderful event. I would also like to thank Dr Om for making me so welcome and Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells for coming along and enjoying the festivities.

        Long has the Nepean Valley been the nursery of junior rugby league stars. On Friday we saw at the St Marys Band Club the annual sports luncheon for Brothers, a key junior rugby league club in our community. Brothers have 45 teams, with some 700 young men playing junior rugby league. This club's major annual fundraiser I was extremely proud to be a part of. It was wonderful to see the Hon.

         Torres Strait Islander

        peoples and the role they play in shaping our community and our identity. Over the course of NAIDOC Week, we also paused to reflect on their sacrifice, the sacrifice of the Aboriginal peoples, and honoured their priceless contribution to our nation. NAIDOC Week is a time to also think about what it has been with the Darug people in the Darug nation, which is where Lindsay resides.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was wonderful to see so many local people and schools turn up to Jamison Park to participate in NAIDOC Week. I would like to commend Penrith Council, I would like to commend Brothers and I would like to thank the Bhutanese community for having such wonderful events over the last couple of weeks. Thank you.
