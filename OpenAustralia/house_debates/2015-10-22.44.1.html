       <p>
        I want to inform the House today that on 10 and 17 October I had the pleasure of attending the Karragullen Expo and the Waroona Show, as well as the Kelmscott Show. These shows demonstrated that the community and volunteer spirit is alive and well in my electorate of Canning, and I would like to thank the following people for their continued commitment to ensuring these events are a great success. Firstly, there is President of the Hills Orchard Improvement Group, Bruno DelSimone, who alongside his committee put together the 32nd Karragullen Expo. It was a fantastic day and I was privileged to be able to present a number of awards at the event and recognise the contributions of the wider Hills community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, there is President of the Waroona Agricultural Society, Mr Eric Walmsley, and Mr Peter Ward, who were kind enough to give me a personal tour of everything the Waroona Show had on offer. Special mentions go to 2015 rural ambassador Kirstin Waller, who is an excellent role model and a fine example of the rural work ethic, and Lisa Gliddon, who took out first prize in open decorated cakes with an amazing tribute to our

        s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the President of the Kelmscott Agricultural Society, Mr Vaughan James, also provided a personal tour at the show. I had the opportunity to see a number of exhibitors. However, a special mention goes to Craig Alford from Armadale Mower World and founder of Ride to the
