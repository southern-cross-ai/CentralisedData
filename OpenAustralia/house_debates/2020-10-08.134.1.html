        I'd like to recognise Stewart Grimmett, who has recently retired after 40 years of teaching at Woodenbong Central School. Stewart arrived in Woodenbong in May 1980 and, indeed, lived at the pub for six months whilst the teachers' flats were being built. Over the years, Stewart had many offers of promotion to work in many other areas around the state, but he never wanted to leave Woodenbong. He loved the school and he loved the community and very much made it his home. Stewart and his wife, Susan, had three daughters—Jacinta, Caitlin and Melissa. Melissa has sadly passed. Jacinta has graduated with a teaching degree, and Caitlin is a psychology graduate. Thank you, Stewart. You loved Woodenbong, and Woodenbong loves you, mate. Happy retirement!

        I'd like to recognise Clara Tolman, Annie Tolman and Zoe Fairfull, who recently won the 2020 Women in Agri-tech Pitch Competition. Clara, Annie and Zoe attend Alstonville High School and won the national competition with their idea for an app called 'Youth in Agriculture: Australia's Future'. The app would connect young people to articles, information and mentors in agricultural careers. It would identify students' interests and suggest workshops and conferences to help them find job opportunities. Clara, Annie and Zoe won $2,000 in cash prizes for Alstonville High. They are going to put this towards purchasing a new steer. Congratulations and well done on this fantastic idea.

I'd also like to recognise Mitch Aubusson from Ballina, who became the most capped Sydney Rooster of all time during the season. Thank you to all the families, coaches and clubs that have helped these players reach the NRL, and congratulations to the players who represent our region at the highest level.
