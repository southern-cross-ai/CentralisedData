       <p>
        This week, so much of the Albanese Labor government's cost-of-living measures have come into effect, from 1 July. This is really important right across the country, particularly in my region, on the far north coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . We all know people are doing it tough, and I know in my area they certainly have been. That's why we have continued to respond by offering important cost-of-living relief. We know there is more to do, but this makes such a big difference to people in my area.
       </p>
       <p>
        First of all, our tax cuts for every single taxpayer across the country: for my area, 71,000 people will receive a tax cut so people can keep more of what they earn. This has been a huge issue, and people have responded very positively to the fact that they are getting that tax cut. On average, in my area, it's $1,384 that people will be receiving with that tax cut. It will make a really important difference when it comes to the cost of living. Of course, the energy bill belief: there will be $300 for every household and $325 for eligible small businesses. Again, this is a major issue that people have raised with me, and it's really important to have this in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, for my area, one of the other major cost-of-living initiatives is the freeze on the cost of PBS medicines. Particularly for a large number of elderly people in my region, I know first hand what a difference it will make for them. This is on top of our policies that are already in place for cheaper medicines and, of course, our tripling of the bulk-billing incentive as well. Accessing health care when you need it is vitally important, particularly for those older Australians with often very complex care needs. So many people in my area are very pleased to have that freeze on the PBS medicines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, we've got the freeze on deeming rates too, which for retirees is vitally important. We also see some of the really strong action that we're taking when it comes to cost-of-living relief in our wiping of about $3 billion from student
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        debt. Again, many students have those major HECS debts, and we've acted on that, because we've listened to people's concerns first hand about what needs to be in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these cost-of-living measures come on top of a third consecutive pay rise for 2.6 million workers that we backed as a government, because it's important they have that pay rise. All of these measures build on some of the many ones we've already delivered, such as cheaper child care, fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and, as I said, the biggest expansion in bulk-billing as well. We've also had major investments in building more houses and increases to paid parental leave, which is so vitally important, particularly for women in terms of them being able to access the workforce. It's great for families and it's great for the economy. Right across the country we've had such a huge range of cost-of-living measures to help people who are really doing it tough.
