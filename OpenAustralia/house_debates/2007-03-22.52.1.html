        My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General inform the House of the progress of counterterrorism operations against

        in the region, especially Indonesia? Attorney-General, is there a high level of cooperation between law enforcement agencies and their regional counterparts?

         I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know of his interest in these matters and I know that members generally would want to know of the involvement of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         with their colleagues abroad. On Tuesday of this week, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Indonesian National Police
         </a>
         conducted operations against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">

         suspects in Yogyakarta,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Java" rel="nofollow">
          Central Java
         </a>
         . As a result of these
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INP" rel="nofollow">
          INP
         </a>
         actions, five suspected
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JI" rel="nofollow">
          JI
         </a>
         operatives have been arrested, including one who was seriously wounded during the arrests. One person, also a suspected JI operative, was fatally wounded during an exchange of gunfire with INP officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         This operation by the Indonesian National Police is associated with ongoing investigations into a key JI member,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dujana" rel="nofollow">
          Abu Dujana
         </a>
         . Media reports claim that he is the current leader of JI. I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that Abu Dujana remains a person of interest to the ongoing Indonesian National Police investigations and that unfortunately he has not been arrested. These operations continue and, for reasons of security, I cannot provide the House with further details at this time but will do so at a later date when I am in a position to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the second aspect of the honourable memberâ€™s question, we congratulate the Indonesian National Police on their efforts against JI. This is the latest in a series of actions that they have undertaken. Of course, JI was responsible for the Bali bombing in 2002 and other attacks in Indonesia, including the bombing of our embassy and the bombing of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
          Marriott Hotel
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a high level of cooperation between Indonesia and the Australian Federal Police over counterterrorism activities. Unfortunately, that cooperation is often linked to tragedy such as the bombings as well as the recent air crash in Yogyakarta, where the Australian Federal Police have been providing forensic assistance. This cooperation exists throughout the region. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         have been resourced under a number of initiatives, including rapid response in fighting terrorism at its source. A counterterrorism liaison position has recently been established in Thailand, and an AFP officer commenced in that role in the Australian embassy last month. Assistance has been given by the AFP and the Australian Bomb Data Centre, and that will strengthen regional cooperation and provide a network for sharing intelligence, particularly in relation to the unlawful use of explosives. A Philippines bomb data centre has been established. As well, the establishment of a bomb data centre in Malaysia and in Thailand is being progressed at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think Australians need to appreciate that they and Australian interests remain one of the targets of JI. It gives us a great deal of confidence that the Australian Federal Police are able to work so cooperatively with our neighbours to bring about an end to the activities of those who would seek to destroy our way of life.
