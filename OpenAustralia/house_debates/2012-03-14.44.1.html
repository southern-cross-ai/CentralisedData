       <p>
        Last Saturday I attended the formal opening of the resurfaced Valley View Tennis Club courts in the Makin electorate. It was a significant event for the tennis club not only because of the importance of the upgrade to the club's future but also because the upgrade was the culmination of over four years of lobbying and hard work by the tennis club members to prevent the club from closing down.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club, which has served the community for over 40 years, had previously been earmarked for closure by the Salisbury council because of the poor condition of the courts. Ultimately, the determination of club members prevailed and, through the collective efforts of Salisbury council, the state government and club members' fundraising activities, around $200,000 was raised, enabling the resurfacing of all courts plus some general upgrading to the car park and general surrounds. The club's efforts also resulted in a considerable increase in club membership and the club now hosts 10 junior teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of Jim and Sophia Zissopoulos, club president, Garry Oaten, and all the committee and club members for their determination and hard work in securing the future of the Valley View Tennis Club. In so doing they have ensured that an important recreational asset continues to be available to the local community and that the 250-plus members of the club have a home base and the opportunity to continue to play competition tennis.
