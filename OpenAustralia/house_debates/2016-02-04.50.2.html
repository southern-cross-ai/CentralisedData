       <p>
        I rise to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        on commissioning the recent television series
        <i>
         The Family Law
        </i>
        , written and developed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Law" rel="nofollow">
         Benjamin Law
        </a>
        . It is a cracker of a show—a laugh a minute—though you will have to take my word for it as I fear that the House's standing orders would preclude my sharing much of the humour in the show with the chamber. I am not sure that quoting Jenny Law would be considered parliamentary.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we are always pleased to see our broadcasters commissioning Australian content, telling Australian stories, it is especially pleasing that this is a comedy show that looks like modern Australia. This is a show about an Australian family—but the Laws happen to be Chinese-Australian. Importantly, the Laws' ethnicity is not the point of the show. As Ben Law has said, it is no more a show about Chinese-Australians than
        <i>
         Seinfeld
        </i>
        is a show about white people. Like modern Australia, the show's diversity is simply a reality rather than a premise. It is who we are, and we ought to see this reality reflected more on our television screens. We have come a long way since the Lim family made a brief appearance on
        <i>
         Neighbours
        </i>
        , only to be accused of eating one of the dogs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Ramsey Street
        </a>
        ! But we have a long way to go—we need to see more families like the Laws, and like my own family, on television.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is equally pleasing that this on-screen diversity in
        <i>
         The Family Law
        </i>
        is mirrored off screen through Ben Law's writing and by the Matchbox Pictures production team, including the amazing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Ayres" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Ayres
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         Debbie Lee
        </a>
        . I recently attended the premiere of
        <i>
         The Family Law
        </i>
        in Melbourne and there was a palpable sense of excitement. So well done to Ben Law, Matchbox Pictures,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Screen Australia
        </a>
        and SBS for
        <i>
         The Family Law
        </i>
        and more, please!
