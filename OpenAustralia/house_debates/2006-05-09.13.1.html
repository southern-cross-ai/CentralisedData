         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders specifically say that people shall not be named unless it is integral and important to the answering of the question. That question can be asked without that name being given, and it is out of order.

           Does the minister believe that it is acceptable that a number of the Maxi-TRANS workers in Ballarat, including Mr Mark Walker, specifically requested training but were denied this opportunity by the company? What action will the government take to provide more training support so that Australian companies like Maxi-TRANS can turn their semiskilled workers into fully qualified tradespeople rather than see them lose their jobs to temporary, skilled workers from overseas? Will the government now join Labor in making its No. 1 priority to train Australians first and to train them now?

             I think the last part was a commercial! I thank the member for Ballarat—and sit down, he said. At the end of the day, as I tried to explain amongst all of the baying at the moon from those opposite, Maxi--TRANS is a company that has lifted an enormous amount of weight in the Ballarat economy when it comes to training people.

                We have almost 4,000 people in training in Ballarat. When Labor was last in office that figure was about 1,000. So at the end of the day there is a lot of work going on in Ballarat when it comes to training. The individual circumstances of individual workers, the relationship they have with their employers and the decision to train is a partnership that workers and their employers should forge.

                   What is absolutely critical is that Australian business understands quite plainly that investing in their workforce is exactly that—it is not a cost to their business; it is a form of investment.

                    Methinks they protest their innocence too much! Those people come not to take jobs but in fact to create jobs. According to a MaxiTRANS spokesman, in relation to the people who have been stood down, due to whatever circumstances the company has decided, it has cut 35 to 37 unskilled or semiskilled jobs. But none of the people reduced from the company’s casual workforce were qualified welders. At the end of it, that proves the point even further. This company has taken it upon itself to train people first—that is the government’s priority. The training of Australians first has always been this government’s priority.

                    This is a bit rich coming from the mob opposite. In 1993, when he was the minister in charge of training, the Leader of the Opposition presided over the single biggest drop in apprenticeship numbers in Australia’s history—30,000 people in the dumpster. This government has more than repaired that circumstance, and the energy of companies like MaxiTRANS should not be criticised in this place under privilege by the member opposite.
