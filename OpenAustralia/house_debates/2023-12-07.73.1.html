       <p>
        Last week I was on my feet in this House talking about volunteer bushfire brigades. Today I'm about to talk about the amazing volunteer surf livesaving clubs right around our country. I have three in Pearce. We have 32 kilometres of coastline, and almost 40 per cent of our community were born overseas. Some people have never been near the beach, so our surf lifesaving clubs are amazing and important assets. I would like to give a big shout out to the Quinns Mindarie
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        Club President Nathaniel Lee, the Yanchep Surf Life Saving Club President Jason Maliphant and also the very new Alkimos Surf Life Saving Club President Shaun Nichollsâ€”a big shout out for what they do with their teams in helping people in our community. Looking after our community in the Quinns Mindarie we have a swimming enclosure, which is really good, but also the Surf Life Saving club keeps a strong eye on that. If you're out at the beach this summer, as school holidays are coming up and people flock to beaches in the warm weather, a very big shout out to all our surf lifesavers not only in the seat of Pearce but right around the country. You do an amazing job in keeping people safe, and it's reassuring to know you're there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Please do swim between the flags, listen to instructions and watch out for the weather because things can change in an instant. We do put our volunteers under pressure, but we thank them for the training that they do to make sure that they're across all their brief, and they do a great job.
