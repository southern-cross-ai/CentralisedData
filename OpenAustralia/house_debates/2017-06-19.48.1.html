        Football Club which celebrated its 100th anniversary on the weekend with a special gala dinner. Four hundred ex-players and supporters came together on Saturday night to celebrate this wonderful milestone and to look back on a century of Rugby League in the Clovelly area. The event was

        Since the club's formation, the Clovelly Crocs—which currently fields 280 players—have developed a strong reputation as fierce and fair-minded competitors. In the club's 100 years, its members and supporters have achieved some great things, producing outstanding talent in players such as

        </a>
        and Des O'Reilly, whilst instilling strong values of sportsmanship and a commitment to all who don the red and white. On Saturday evening, they named a team of the century, which included some Australian representatives of both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Union" rel="nofollow">

        and Rugby League. The club has taught generations of young people the wonderful benefits of leading active and healthy lifestyles. Rugby League and volunteerism are woven into the fabric of the eastern suburbs of Sydney. I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the many, many community members that have been volunteers for the Clovelly Crocs over the last century. I wish the club all the best. Congratulations on 100 years, and all the best for the next 100 years of Rugby League at Clovelly.
