       <p>
        Last weekend I had the pleasure of helping to open almost $10 million worth of capital works at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Hervey Bay
        </a>
        ’s Xavier Catholic College representing ministers Bishop and Truss. The college opened in 2003 with a student enrolment of 90, all of them in grade 8. But already it has forged a fine reputation in sporting, cultural and academic excellence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Departing from my set script that day, I was inspired to reflect on four images. The day was quite windy, so I felt it symbolised the spirit in the school. With most of the 720 students present, it reinforced the image of a young city like Hervey Bay. Hervey Bay faces some challenging infrastructure problems. In that respect the Catholic community in Hervey Bay has played its part in providing infrastructure which helps to make a diverse community cohesive and focused. I also had an image of choice at the opening. All families want to have a choice of where their kids are educated. By funding both government and non-government schools, the coalition is giving parents that choice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part and parcel of providing quality education for children is creating a learning environment, whether that be in classrooms, playgrounds, science labs or the school library. This has been one of the largest capital works agendas I have seen over such a short time. Xavier Catholic College is doing a fine job by promoting a tremendous school spirit and giving students a truly Christian outlook on the wider world. A big part of that comes from support, fellowship and friendship of the schools, leaders and faculty.
       </p>
       <p>
        The blessing of the college was carried out by the

       </p>
       <p>
        It is most impressive to see a school forge ahead in the way that Xavier has. Today, with around 720 students—most of those in the secondary grades; only 185 are in the primary school—who are well supported by 81 staff, the school has a great future. The facilities which were opened at the weekend officially brought online all of the school’s primary classrooms, a senior technology precinct—said to be one of the best in the state—several general purpose classrooms, new computing and science facilities, and the college library and extensions to staff and administrative areas. It is a very fine college.
