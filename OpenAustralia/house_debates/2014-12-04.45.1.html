        Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, as I do, that truckies carry this nation. Indeed, it was in this context that I was honoured to speak at the White Hill Truck Drivers Memorial last Saturday, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Bridge
        </a>
        , to commemorate truckies and those involved in the road transport industry who, sadly, have lost their lives doing this crucially important job.
       </p>
       <p>
        The life of a truck driver, particularly an interstate truck driver, is marked by long days, great responsibility and a good deal of loneliness where often your best friend is the radio or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB" rel="nofollow">
         CB
        </a>
        . It is hard on families both for those in the cab and those who remain at home. Sadly, sometimes the cost of just doing your job is far greater than a person might reasonably expect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thankfully, the industry has moved past the days of the cowboys but this is still a dangerous profession and there is no substitute for experience. Many people do not realise that getting 70 tonnes, travelling at 80 kilometres an hour, to stop takes a bit more effort and skill than doing the same in the family sedan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The White Hill memorial has two sections: the left hand of the wall commemorates those who have died on the job, while the right-hand side is for drivers and others involved in the transport industry who are no longer with us.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Wood" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and others involved in the subcommittee for their work in ensuring that the lives of these men and, increasingly, women get the recognition they deserve. This country once rode on the sheep's back. But now this country rides behind the prime mover. May I wish all our truckies safe journeys home.
