        I rise to inform the House of an extraordinary individual, Merv Kurz from Springbrook. I offer his name into the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        for the extraordinary contribution he's made over five decades to that community. I recently attended a community event in Springbrook where we celebrated Merv's 87 years of life, but we also recognised his 55-year commitment to the Springbrook community as their dedicated contract postman. For over five decades, Merv has exemplified the essence of community service, demonstrating a genuine concern for the welfare of others. Imagine delivering mail day in, day out, facing road closures, blackouts, potholes that could swallow his entire van at times, barking dogs, obscured letterboxes and badly addressed envelopes. Despite these challenges, Merv not only has weathered the storms and bushfires but has done so with genuine smile on his face. At Christmas, he works tirelessly delivering seven days a week because, in his eyes, the mail just has to be delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Merv's tenure in the community has seen him serve as a bulldozer driver, timber cutter, bus driver and trip manager. Merv's diverse contributions made him an integral part of the fabric of Springbrook. He was instrumental in establishing the rural fire brigade, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of others in the community. Throughout daily interactions and genuine care, he has fostered unity amongst the residents. Merv attends all Anzac Day services in his father's World War

        jeep, carrying the veterans and locals who can't walk in the march any longer. His presence not only is symbolic but represents the commitment to shared values that binds us all together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was told while I was up there recently that locals will often time their home duties to coincide with a break to chat with Merv and that many preschool children eagerly await the moment they will receive mail from the beloved postie. Merv has inspired others to contribute to the community, creating a legacy that will be remembered and cherished for future generations. Merv takes pride in handing over the reins to his teenage grandkids. Get this: as a team, one, Ella, is on their P plates, and the other one is Caylan, who is 15. So the bloke who's 15 puts the mail in the letterbox while Ella, with the P plates, delivers the mail for the community. On behalf of the Springbrook community I express our deepest gratitude to Merv Kurz. for his tireless service.

        Pauline Duece, who made some biscuits for us up there, got to her feet during the ceremony, saying that young Caylan has to remember her name. She told the community that Caylan thought her name was 'Where's my biscuits?' because every time he drives up the driveway he says, 'Here's your mail, where's my biscuits?'!
