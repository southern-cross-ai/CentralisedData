        Today I would like to acknowledge the fantastic work of three disability organisations based within the Goldstein community: Marriott Support Services,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayley_House" rel="nofollow">
         Bayley House
        </a>
        and MOIRA Disability and Youth Services. These institutions play an enormously important role in supporting those most vulnerable in the community. By engaging with individuals in a community-focused and care-giving manner, these organisations ensure that those with disabilities are given the best chance to reach their full potential and enjoy the benefits of their freedom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marriott Support Services has been offering disabled people choice and opportunity since the 1970s. By focussing on ability, Marriott's guiding principles enable people to do what they can rather than what they cannot. Marriott's employment opportunities include packaging and light assembly tasks. Each job is approached with the same work ethic and dedication to success that would be expected of any type of social enterprise. Jobseekers with a disability are also given support with resume preparation, coaching, interview skill tips and career development. Under the measured leadership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Dan Romanis, and Virginia Rogers, a former director and now chair of the organisation, Marriott Support Services remains a first-rate example of goodwill and outcomes in the Goldstein community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exactly the same thing can be said about Bayley House, which has been part of the Brighton community since 1951. Originally established as the Helping Hand Association, Bayley House provides support for people with an intellectual disability and, most importantly, also their families. More than 40 people live in one of Bayley House's residential colleges, and over 100 people access their respite services each year. Many of these services are made possible through the support of many businesses within the community, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Guys" rel="nofollow">
         The Good Guys
        </a>
        , Brighton, Officeworks, Highett, and the Brighton Medical Clinic. I would also like to pay tribute to Bayley House chief executive, Bruce Salvin, and president, Rhonda Whitfield, as well as Faye Barrow and the wonderful Bayley Birds, who raise money through community efforts and charitable giving every year.

        Last week I had the pleasure of attending the annual stakeholder meeting for MOIRA Disability and Youth Services. MOIRA joins Marriott Support Services and Bayley House in empowering people to live independently and fulfil their own lives regardless of their ability or their circumstance. Last year saw MOIRA expand its service models in residential housing. With the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, MOIRA is now offering additional support services for people from all walks of life. Their presence in the north-east of Melbourne is growing, enabling new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        clients to access therapy support, disability recreation and youth services, among other programs. MOIRA works closely and constructively with state and Commonwealth government departments, local councils and our other service providers. That is why we give thanks to their leadership team, in particular the CEO, Warwick Cavanagh, president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Enright" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and treasurer, John Wheller.
       </p>
       <p>
        We, as a just society, always have an obligation to make sure nobody is left behind due to circumstances beyond their control. Services are always best designed and delivered closest to the people that they serve. That is what these organisations do. They come together collectively to ensure that those who need our support are able to get it from within their own community. They keep people in their own community so that they get not just close support but the maximum amount of support and so that we come together to support people as much as we can. I acknowledge and thank all our local heroes who lead these efforts of social inclusiveness and opportunity so that everybody can reach their full potential in the Goldstein community, because that is what makes the Goldstein community so special. It is people coming together to form family, community and part of our great country.
