       <p>
        We've heard a lot about aspiration this week. Well, Vince Cooney has an aspiration. Vince runs a bed and breakfast in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwent_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Derwent Valley
        </a>
        in my electorate. Vince's aspiration is to run a successful business to provide his guests with a quality experience, but his aspiration is being blocked by this government and its complete and utter failure to deliver quality broadband to regional Tasmania. Vince is connected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        by fixed wireless. For the past 18 months, Vince has been tearing his hair out because of the dreadful NBN at his B&amp;B. He's been told that, while his tower is not technically congested, it experiences heavy use in the busy period, in the evenings. Well, fancy that!
       </p>
       <p>
        Who would've thought that a tower would be busiest at the time when most people want to use it! It's a bit like a traffic planner being surprised that roads are busiest when people are going to and from work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports of congestion on the fixed wireless network are growing across regional Australia. NBN Co claims that only six per cent of towers are affected. Frankly, I find that hard to believe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vince has done everything that has been asked of him. He has contacted Telstra, NBN Co, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        and the telecommunications ombudsman, all to no avail. All he wants—his aspiration—is to run his successful business, and he is being held up by this failure of a Prime Minister and this failure of an NBN.
