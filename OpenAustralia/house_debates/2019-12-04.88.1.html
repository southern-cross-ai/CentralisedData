        I wish to congratulate all of the staff and volunteers of the Randwick
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Emergency_Service" rel="nofollow">
         State Emergency Service
        </a>
        , who recently celebrated its 60th anniversary. Last Friday I joined members of our community to celebrate this milestone. It was an opportunity to thank those unsung heroes who have dedicated their time and skills to our community over the last six decades. The Randwick SES and its volunteers do so much in our community and beyond. They're the men and women in orange that are there after storms, repairing homes, removing fallen trees and the like.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Randwick SES were involved in the largest insurance event ever in Australia's history, the 1999 hail storms that saw many homes and small businesses in our area damaged. They've also helped out in other areas across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , particularly during the recent bushfire crisis, and after storm and flooding damage in other parts of Sydney. When the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS" rel="nofollow">
         SOS
        </a>
        goes out, our SES volunteers respond.
       </p>
       <p>
        But they're also there during the good times. The volunteers have been there for major community events. Just over the last six weeks they've been involved in the Bali commemoration, the Maroubra fun run and the Step Out Speak Out walk against domestic violence in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to see the new improvements made to the Randwick SES operations centre with the help of one of our Stronger Communities Program grants, and see that funding put to good use. Congratulations to all concerned with Randwick SES and thank you for your 60 years of dedicated service.
