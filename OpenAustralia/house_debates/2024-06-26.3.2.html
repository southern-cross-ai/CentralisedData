        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the number of older people in Australia is anticipated to grow from 4.31 million people aged over 65 years in 2021 to 6.66 million by 2041 with the number of those aged over 85 years anticipated to grow 140 per cent from 534,000 to 1.28 million over that same timeframe;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) many older Australians report experiencing age discrimination, elder abuse, financial stress and homelessness;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) one in three people report experiencing age discrimination after turning 50, with employment-related and other forms of age discrimination reported including when accessing businesses and financial, and Government services such as My Aged Care;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) 20 per cent of pensioners are considering going back to work but barriers in place to their doing so reportedly include dealing with government services including finding digitally-based Services Australia interfaces inaccessible;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) 94 per cent of older people are concerned about rising living costs in the long term, 26 per cent are extremely concerned, and 24 per cent of older people report an inability to access dental care due to its cost;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) Australia's homeless population is ageing, with the rate of homelessness growing by over 30 per cent between 2011 and 2016 for older women;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) one in six older Australians reported experiencing elder abuse (psychological, neglect, financial, physical and/or sexual) in 2021, with higher rates among those experiencing poor health or social isolation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) many retirement village residents report poor transparency and lax consumer protections and calls have been made for a national review and harmonisation of regulation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) calls on the Government to establish a portfolio and Minister for Older Australians to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) demonstrate the Government's commitment to older people during a time of demographic change in which Australians are expected to live longer lives, but with increased reliance on key services such as health and aged care;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) act as a conduit between Government and the community to better engage with older people on matters which concern them, beyond aged care, and enable a whole of Government approach to policy-making for and with older Australians across multiple sectors and Government agencies;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) ensure Government services are accessible and inclusive for all including those who may not have ease of digital access or may be experiencing hearing or vision loss;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) champion our older Australians and shift the narrative of older people as vulnerable and in need of support (a 'burden') to more positive aspects of ageing and the contribution older people make to the economy and society;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) work with older people and the sector to address key issues including age discrimination, elder abuse, social exclusion and isolation, homelessness, access to and cost of health care, and financial stress; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) reframe the current narrative to recognise that older people helped to build our nation and continue to represent some of our greatest assets, rather than promoting intergenerational competition or conflict.

        (1) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) natural gas is a key pillar of the Australian economy which employs 80,000 people in the industry supply chain, largely in regional areas;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) natural gas is connected to more than five million Australian homes and provided 42 per cent of the energy consumed by the Australian manufacturing sector in 2022;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) natural gas is essential to Australia achieving its net zero target by 2050;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Australia has a critical role in providing a reliable source of natural gas to trusted trading partners which rely on our supplies for energy security; and

       <p class="italic">
        (e) regional Australia has benefitted enormously from long-term investment in the natural gas sector;

        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) new natural gas supply is needed to meet energy demand and reduce emissions in Australia and overseas;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) the natural gas sector provided $17.1 billion in taxes, royalties and charges in 2023-24 allowing governments to invest in critical services and public infrastructure; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) urges the Government to take urgent action to provide policy certainty which allows the industry to bring on the new gas supply needed to address forecast shortfalls, ensure Australia's energy security, and rebuild investor confidence.
