        On 7 December 2003 a great tragedy befell a Queensland family.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morcombe" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Morcombe
        </a>
        was abducted and murdered on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He had been on his way home to do some Christmas shopping. For Bruce an Denise Morcombe it marked the beginning of any parent's worst nightmare, but one thing we have seen unfold from this terrible event is the great strength and inspiration that has risen from the ashes as Bruce and Denise formed the Daniel Morcombe Foundation. The foundation was established as a legacy to Daniel. It has two main aims: to educate children on how to stay safe in physical and online environments and to support young victims of crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting Bruce and Denise. They are inspirational people who have walked a remarkable journey. Like many people, I have followed their story over many years. As the mother of two daughters I cannot imagine what it would be like to lose a child at any stage of life, let alone in the awful circumstances that Bruce and Denise lost their son Daniel. Their passion now is to help other children. I was truly humbled to spend time with them to learn more about the foundation they created. Denise told me that the foundation has four main goals: to educate children regarding their personal safety, including abduction; to assist victims of crime, particularly where crime involves children; to keep the memory of Daniel alive through various child safety community events; and to support the families of missing persons, particularly where it involves children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Denise and Bruce have developed the Daniel Morecombe Child Safety Curriculum for school students in prep to year 9. Denise says the program is based on three main words, encouraging children to 'recognise, react and report' unsafe situations. The program has been endorsed by the Queensland education system and is available to state, independent and Catholic schools. The Morecombes are encouraging other states and territories to also take it up. As a federal member of parliament I urge every school in every town in every state to review and adopt the program.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Capricornia, the Morecombes will next month visit three schools. They will be talking to students at St Anthony's primary school in Rockhampton on 14 August, at Moranbah State School on 15 August and Coppabella State School also on 15 August. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        , during 2011-12 there were 252,962 notifications of suspected child abuse and many child deaths and murders. The Morecombes' program will help equip children to have the confidence to recognise, react and report unsafe situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I posted a photo of the Morecombes' visit on my Facebook site last night I got a comment from a lady called Jill, who described Bruce and Denise has 'an amazing family who should have been named Australians of the Year'. Another comment on Facebook, from Robert, said the way the Morecombes took such personal tragedy and use the energy to do good in the world for others is purely inspirational.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the 10th annual Day for Daniel, to mark the life of Daniel Morecombe, will be held on Friday, 31 October. It is a few months away yet, but as we head towards the day I want to call on all members of parliament to support their cause. Wouldn't it be an amazing thing if we put our political differences aside and worked towards this goal? I call upon the House and, indeed, even the Senate of this great institution to show bipartisanship support to make the Daniel Morecombe Child Safety Curriculum not just part of the curriculum in various states but part of the national education curriculum in every school in every town in every part of Australia. It is time to show some humanity as national leaders and ensure that the tragedy that struck down young Daniel Morecombe too early in his life was not in vain. Let us as a parliament support Bruce and Denise Morecombe's endeavours to see their program available in every school in the country.
