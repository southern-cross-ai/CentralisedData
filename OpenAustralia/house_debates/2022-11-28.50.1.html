        I'm concerned about the rise of vaping that is sweeping through our schools. It's our responsibility as parliamentarians and parents to care for our young people, and that includes stronger policy focused on prevention strategies and campaigning with government, academics, healthcare professionals and teachers to stop vaping. Despite the huge uptake of vaping, there aren't many studies on its long-term impacts, unlike on the well-known damage and cancers caused by cigarettes.

Students from all year groups were known to be vaping, and many were doing so at school. Direct social media marketing, peer pressure and seeing older students vaping is linked to a growth in students vaping. I'm hearing of smoke alarms being removed from the toilets at school and students corralling in the bathrooms to vape. The AMA study found that teachers locking toilets during class time reduced vaping. Schools should not have to use this extreme approach to curbâ€”
