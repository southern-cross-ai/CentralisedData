        My question is to the Minister for Health. The minister would be aware that the National Rural Health Students Network are in the parliament today. Could the minister explain how the government is ensuring that regional students who wish to study nursing, medicine and allied health can do so in regional Australia, thus training local people to meet the needs of local communities? Will the minister also consider using the

        rebate as an incentive for graduates to locate in regional Australia?

         I thank the member for New England for his question. I have very much enjoyed my visits to his home town and I have been able to witness his strong commitment to his local community. My office met today with the National Rural Health Students Networkâ€”and they are in the gallery today as my guests, if they want to give us a wave. I am terrifically pleased that we have students of such high calibre who will be the doctors and allied health professionals of tomorrow.

         We know that people who come from, or study in, rural and regional communities end up working in and staying in those communities.

         , from Orange, is here. He is studying medicine in Geelong. He grew up in a regional town and he understands the particular needs of a regional town. Ben Croft, from Tamworth, is here. He is studying pharmacy in Armidale and, no doubt, he will one day be filling scripts for the member for New England. And also here is Simon Reid, from Wollongong, who is studying medicine in Sydney and wants to return to coastal

         It is also great that, as well as coming down here to lobby, they have been taking time out to talk to more than 300 high school students to encourage them to think about a career in rural and regional medicine. We have a very proud record of support for rural and regional students in Australia. We fund 17 rural clinical schools. We fund the John Flynn Placement Program to support 300 students each year to undertake training in medicine, nursing and allied health, encouraging the recruitment and retention of health professionals in rural areas. This year we are offering 241 clinical placement scholarships for allied health students undertaking a placement in rural or remote locations. We are investing in medical, nursing and allied health student accommodation through the Health and Hospital Fund, with $2.6 million in Ballarat and $5.2 million in

         . As the member for New England indicated in his question, we also have a

         reimbursement scheme for medical students. We spent $7 million on the scheme last year, with 530 participants working in rural communities. Of course, I am happy for my colleague the Minister for Higher Education to look at whether that scheme should be extended to allied health professionals also.
