       <p>
        Last week I spoke about the numerous shows, field days and farm fairs that occur across Barker at this time. Indeed, my office has termed this time of the year 'show season'. I mentioned in my speech last week that I had put my hand up to take part in the Header Demolition Derby in Keith's Diesel and Dirt Derby. I rise today to update the House on this event—because, quite frankly, I am proud that I survived! The opportunity for competitors to smash their headers into one another was given an extra sweetener this year with their local federal member participating—and what a target I presented, driving a huge combine harvester emblazoned with my electoral corflute. I was pretty hard to miss—and they did not miss!
       </p>
       <p>
        Having a background in livestock farming I cannot say I was all that confident driving the harvester, but I am pleased to tell the House that I came out in better shape than did the header, which is now sitting in the back of a shed ready for some much-needed repairs—and I will undertake those repairs so that I can enter the event next year and hopefully do a little better. But all jokes aside, shows such as the Keith Diesel and Dirt Derby are important in strengthening community spirit. More than 10,000 people attended the event. There was a fantastic atmosphere, and it gave me a great opportunity to ensure that I am listening to the people of that community on the matters that concern them. I commend Glen Simpson and the Keith Show Society for putting on such a great event.
