       <p>
        Today, I would like to speak about a constituent in my electorate of Capricornia, Mrs Rose Swaddling
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who was awarded an Order of Australia Medal in January. Rose is a stalwart of the Rockhampton community and a very deserving Australian to receive such a high honour. When Rose heard she was awarded the OAM, her first comments were, 'There are more deserving people than me.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Growing up in Rockhampton, one of the first community projects she was involved in was with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        at the age of nine. Rose remembers being inspired to serve her community by the then mayor, Rex Pilbeam, when Rockhampton was experiencing the flood of 1954. Mr Pilbeam visited her home and others living in the flooded suburb of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depot_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Depot Hill
        </a>
        by boat to make sure they were safe and to deliver bread and milk. This one act of kindness by the mayor would lead Rose down the path of serving the community she so loves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Encouraged by her husband, Graham, and a number of friends, Rose ran for a place on council. In 1994, Rose was sworn in as a councillor to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhampton_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Rockhampton City Council
        </a>
        . It was here that she would serve her community for 26 years. Rose saw Rockhampton through floods and droughts, de-amalgamations and amalgamations, and saw mayors come and go, yet Rose was a stability and constant for the Rockhampton region residents. It shows her character that during the 2012 council election, Rose was elected unopposed—it shows her character that no-one would run against her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rose was well-known for saying, 'I'm into people, not politics.' This saying is something that has stood by her through her life. Rose has dedicated her life and much of her time to many community groups: Neighbourhood Watch Rockhampton; Crime Stoppers Queensland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhampton_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Rockhampton Region
        </a>
        ;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        ; Mount Archer Lions Club; Victims of Crime Association, Central Queensland Branch; Glenmore Community Service Club and the Capricorn Citizens Advocacy Committee; the Rockhampton Auxiliary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        ; and as a patron for many other community organisations. She has always lobbied for members of the community—some of our most vulnerable: the veterans, the elderly, Indigenous and multicultural communities. Her belief that the broader community has much to learn from these people has shone through with everything that Rose puts her hand to. Many people across the Rockhampton region have experienced Rose's care and thoughtfulness. With her talent for leaving anyone she meets feeling like they're the most important person in the room.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal level, as the federal member for Capricornia, I have worked with Rose over the past 10 years. Rose has always guided and advised me throughout difficult times. I love that she's so dedicated to the community. She loves them and they love her. There is something truly amazing about a person who can dedicate so much time and support to an organisation, let alone as many as Rose does. On behalf of my constituents, thank you, Rose, for your tireless dedication to our community. You have left a great legacy in our region. Thank you.
