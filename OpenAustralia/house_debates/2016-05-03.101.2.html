         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 2) 2016-2017, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2016-2017, which was introduced earlier by the Treasurer, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2016-2017, are the budget appropriation bills for the 2016-17 financial year. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2016-2017 provides for appropriations that are not for the ordinary annual services of government, such as for capital works, and services and payments to states, territories and local governments. This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just under $9 billion for 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions in the bill seek authority for appropriations broadly equivalent to seven-twelfths of the estimated 2016-17 annual appropriations plus budget measures. Together with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Supply Bill
        </a>
        (No. 2) 2016-2017, this bill provides appropriations for activities that are not for the ordinary annual services of government for the full year 2016-17. I now outline four significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the Department of Communications and the Arts would receive just under $4.9 billion in 2016-17. This is required to provide equity funding to nbn co to continue to roll out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        would receive just under $1.4 billion, which includes an additional $700 million in 2016-17 to support the defence strategy and capability plans detailed in the 2016 defence white paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development would receive just under $544 million in 2016-17. This would be used to support Roads to Recovery to help local governments and councils maintain Australia's roads, the Drought Communities Program, preparatory works on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        airport and an equity injection for the Moorebank Intermodal Company.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth, just over $310 million is proposed for the Department of Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . This includes $50 million in concessional loan funding in 2016-17 to establish the national water infrastructure loan facility. Loans would be provided to the states and territories to support major water infrastructure projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also provides the debit limits for the nation-building funds the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund, the general purpose financial assistance payments and the National Partnership payments. The debit limits relate to the estimated expenditure for the balance of 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
