        Last Sunday it was my honour to attend the ceremony of Angus 'Fox' Starkey receiving his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout Award
        </a>
        . This is one of the last Queen's Scout Awards to be presented, as it will now be the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Scout_Award" rel="nofollow">
         King's Scout Award
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Angus is a fine young man and has suffered personal tragedy, having lost his father two years ago when he was just 17. It was easy to see that his scouting family had stood up and made sure that he had the support he needed to get through this difficult time. I love organisations like the Scouts, as they help to produce citizens who possess great attributes such as honesty, integrity, a hard-work ethic, punctuality and self-confidence. Angus' mum, Sylvia, is a Scout leader herself and was proud as punch to watch her son receive this most prestigious award along with his Scout family and some rather cheeky mates from high school, like Jayden.
       </p>
       <p>
        As someone who has come from a small-business ownership and having employed hundreds of people over the years, I shared with those present that when a job applicant had involvement in Scouts or similar organisations, like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys'_Brigade" rel="nofollow">
         Boys' Brigade
        </a>
        , on their resume it gave them an edge on gaining employment. So, parents, if you want to help give your children the tools they need for success, please consider Scouts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, Angus! I know your mum is proud of you. And so would your dad be.
