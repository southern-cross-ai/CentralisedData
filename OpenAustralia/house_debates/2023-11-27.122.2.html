        I wish to add to an answer. I was asked in question 1 and question 3 in question time today about confidentiality and meetings with other world leaders. I want to add some context here. This is from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">
         Marise Payne
        </a>
        on 25 September 2018:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We've had a very productive and constructive bilateral. It was my first meeting with State Councilor Wang Yi … We have had a good discussion about a number of issues, I'm not going to go into the detail, I regard these things as confidential bilateral engagements …
       </p>
       <p>
        This, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , is about the United States and discussions:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But on security matters … again, I keep my counsel and discussions with our ally at a private level, at a confidential level. We're in constant engagement with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just in case we want to get the other side of the disputes over there,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        on 1 October 2013 said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I am not going to spill the beans on discussions which necessarily should be confidential if they’re to be as constructive and collegial and candid as they need to be …
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony Abbott, again, in 2012 said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think the best way to strengthen relations with Indonesia, which is such a critically important neighbour, such a very important friend, is to respect private conversations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony Abbott, on 4 May 2015, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I'm not going to comment on private conversations between Australian government ministers and Indonesian government ministers …
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        , the current Leader of the Opposition, on 2 January 2019, we had:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What I said is that there was engagement with Fiji, and as to private conversations, detailed briefings, that were conducted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        and others, that's not something we will publicly comment on.
       </p>
       <p>
        They then went on to get more questions in that press conference, and he answered with this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Look, in relation to what I said or what my office said in briefings, I'm not going to comment on that. I act to keep Australians safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, I act to keep Australian safe. That is what we are doing, and that is what we are delivering through our international relations.
