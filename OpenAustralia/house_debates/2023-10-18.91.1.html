        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Water. How is the Albanese Labor government working to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and why is it important for both houses of parliament to support these efforts? What are the obstacles to progress?

        <p>
         Thanks so much to the member for Boothby. She is absolutely determined to see the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered in full, as are all of us on this side and thankfully those on the crossbench as well. Today we passed legislation through the House of Representatives to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank all members of the parliament who supported the bill today, because over the last month we've had a really stark reminder of just why it's necessary to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We're seeing the return of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nino" rel="nofollow">
          El Nino
         </a>
         after three years of good rain—in fact, too much rain in some instances. We're now seeing a return to hotter, drier weather patterns. We've seen record temperatures across the country. We've seen some of the hottest September days ever, and from painful experience we know what this next El Nino cycle means. It means less rain, more extreme heat, more bushfire risk and more pressure on our rivers, on our farmers and on the Murray-Darling Basin system, the source of drinking water for three million Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The time for talking and the time for delay is over. We must deliver this plan, and that's what we're doing. Our legislation has something that all parties should be able to support, because it has something for everyone. Those opposite asked for more time to deliver the plan, and that's what this legislation does. There is more time for states to complete their water efficiency projects. That's precisely what the National Party in particular have asked for. More time is what the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers Federation
         </a>
         have been calling for. It gives more options as well, allowing for on-farm and off-farm water efficiency projects, for land and water purchase and for counting of the excess water recovered under the bridging the gap target towards the 450-gigalitre target. All of that means less reliance on voluntary purchase—again, something that the National Party should be supporting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our bill also delivers the full 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. That's why those sitting on the crossbench, as well as all of our Labor MPs, support it. They know how important this is for the environment. That's why they've worked so cooperatively with us on in bill. As well as thanking the independent members, I thank the Greens for voting for this legislation. I hope that they will also support this legislation in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is one of the largest investments in the environment that any government will ever make. This is a million square kilometres of inland Australia, 16 Ramsar listed wetlands, 35 endangered species and 120 different types of waterbirds. The proposal is sensible. It is balanced, and I hope others step up and support it.
