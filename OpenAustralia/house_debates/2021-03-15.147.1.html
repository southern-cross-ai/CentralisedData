        There has never been a better time to celebrate the bold and brave students across Australia who've weathered an educational storm like no other throughout 2020. The Goldstein medal is awarded to students in their second-to-last year each year at school in every school across the community of Goldstein, because we believe in honouring the service of the woman after which the Goldstein electorate is named,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vida_Goldstein" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and her commitment to freedom, service and respect. The medal ties Goldstein's young leaders to that legacy because of the value of those commitments. Vida Goldstein's legacy embodies these values as she was the first woman to run for parliament in the

        . She also had the courage and vision to fight for the rights of women to stand for parliament, to vote, to buy property and to enter into marriage on the same terms as men. She was, as we'd say, a marriage equality advocate of her time.

        Each of these students reflects the best values of their community. Their positive engagement with schooling life and their commitment to their peers models the constructive community engagement that helps to build an ever stronger Australia. Ordinarily, of course, I would take as much opportunity as possible to present those Goldstein medals to students across the community but, because of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020, I could not. Where I did, I saw young, bright minds wanting to make a contribution not just to their school community but to the success of the nation. Never forget: the foundation of the success of this country doesn't come from the strength of Canberra; it comes from the citizen up. 2020 was a challenging year for everybody. We should celebrate the extraordinary perseverance and commitment students across Goldstein have shown during the pandemic. We should also celebrate the untiring work of our teachers, parents and guardians, who have all supported the adaptability and success of our education system despite disruptions. Once again, congratulations to the 2020 Goldstein medal recipients and those from previous years, and I look forward to presenting more in the years to come.
