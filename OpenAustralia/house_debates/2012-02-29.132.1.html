       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of attending the 50th anniversary of a wonderful organisation in my local community, Nepean Legacy. Legacy was born out of the promises made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        diggers to care for the families of their mates should anything happen to them during their military service. Since 1962 Nepean Legacy has been keeping that promise alive in my local community for families of Australian war veterans killed or injured during their service.
       </p>
       <p>
        The spirit of Legacy is service. It is an organisation that honours the service of those brave Australians who fought for the freedom of our nation and made the ultimate sacrifice. Nepean Legacy currently offers support to 540 local widows, two

        students and 15 people with disabilities. Since being officially formed in 1962, Nepean Legacy has provided invaluable assistance to over 10,000 local families, protecting their basic needs, advocating for their entitlements and providing them with emotional support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nepean Legacy has a strong group of dedicated volunteers from all walks of life united in their selfless commitment to the Legacy cause. These generous volunteers regularly give up their time to advance the great work of Legacy in our community through fundraising and coordinating events. Over the past 50 years, Legacy has gone from strength to strength. One legatee has been involved every step of the way.

        was one of the original 12 members who formed Nepean Legacy. David is now 87 years of age and remains one of the group's most active members, currently holding the position of publicity officer. His passion for assisting others in need is an inspiration and I thank him for his service to our community and to our nation.

       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of Nepean Legacy Chairman Jeff Townsend. Jeff is passionate about the continuity of Legacy in our local community. He has called on junior legatees, who are children assisted by Legacy, to get involved in the organisation so that its important work can live on. I recognise Nepean Legacy secretary Louise Rumble of

       </p>
       <p>
        Fifty years of service is an outstanding achievement. I congratulate and thank the many volunteers who have made this possible. I hope to see the great work of Nepean Legacy continuing in my local community for many years to come.
