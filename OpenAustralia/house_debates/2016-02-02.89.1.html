        My question is to the Minister for Territories,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        and Major Projects. I note that, for many years, infrastructure in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        has been neglected. It is under this government that we are finally seeing investment in infrastructure in Western Sydney. Two key roads in my electorate include the Werrington Arterial Road and the Northern Road, where amazing work is being done. I ask the minister: can you please outline the plan for infrastructure in Western Sydney and how this is going to facilitate the massive population growth that we will see in our region?

         I thank the member for Lindsay, who is, of course, an extremely effective member and advocate for the needs of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         and for her constituents in the electorate of Lindsay. The population of Western Sydney is going to rise from two to three million people over the next 20 years. The member for Lindsay is a very strong advocate for the transport and infrastructure planning which is necessary to meet the needs of Western Sydney. The Turnbull government is doing more than just planning; it is delivering on infrastructure for Western Sydney. Just a few days ago, we announced $6.7 million for the Northern Road intersection upgrade in Lindsay. This forms part of the $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan. In fact, there is an enormous amount happening when it comes to delivering infrastructure in Western Sydney to meet the needs of constituents in Lindsay and right across Western Sydney. For example, construction is underway on the Bringelly Road and on stage 1 of the Northern Road upgrade. Route identification is underway on the M12 motorway, which will go to the Western Sydney Airport. Early next year work will commence on stage 3 of the Northern Road, with major upgrades of intersections at the M4, at Glenmore Parkway and at Bradley Street.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull and Baird governments are working together on the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan. There is $35 million from each government for developing and constructing road improvements to alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow along Mulgoa Road and Castlereagh Street, adjacent to the CBD of Penrith. Indeed, in the most recent round of black spots announcements some $400,000 was allocated to the electorate of Lindsay across five projects. It is enormously important that we have a plan for infrastructure in Western Sydneyâ€”and we do. It is enormously important that we deliver on that plan, and the Turnbull government, working with the Baird government, is delivering on that plan. And it is enormously important that we have effective, hardworking advocates for their electorate like the member for Lindsay.
