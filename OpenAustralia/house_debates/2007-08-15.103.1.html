       <p>
        In my electorate there are more than 15,000 small businesses registered. They generate considerable employment growth. I have always had an interest in the area of small business, bearing in mind that I owned a small business. That is why I was quite happy to accept the invitation of the local chamber of commerce to attend the recent Pollies for Small Business Day. I had the opportunity to spend time with a number of employers who operate businesses at Casula Mall. In particular, I spent time with Daryl Lawson, who owns the Michel’s Patisserie franchise, and Phillip Di Fruncesco, who owns and operates the

        </a>
        facility at Casula Mall.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank them for their time in showing a member of parliament around their businesses and in discussing with me the issues they had. Both of these businesses are seven-day-a-week operations. I know full well the issues of balancing business and home concerns as well as balancing business and home finances. Both these gentlemen ran superb operations. They made the point that, quite frankly, it is something you do not take for granted. These businesses are only successful if you work them and work them properly. These franchises had two issues in common—attracting and retaining qualified staff, staff who understood that the delivery of good service was significant in bringing return trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        These family businesses have put a lot into their community. That is the point I want to make. These people live and work in their communities. Not only are their interests in relation to the business affairs or commercial aspects of their business but also they participate in genuine community development efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Casula Mall Centre Manager, Sharon Bosnajak, for organising my time behind the counter. It is a fine facility out there. Sharon spends a significant amount of time not simply organising affairs at the centre but also assisting those businesses that choose to set up and operate out of Casula Mall. Casula Mall serves the fast-growing area of Liverpool. The area has benefited greatly from having this facility. Moreover, the area has benefited by having people such as Sharon Bosnajak, Daryl Lawson and Phillip Di Fruncesco.
