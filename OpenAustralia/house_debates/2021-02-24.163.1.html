         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . In her usual selfless manner, Jeannette said she was very honoured and privileged to receive the award but acknowledged the contribution of everyone who has been involved in her journey. And what a journey it has been for Jeannette Rainbow! She has been involved in the Wauchope District Historical Society, the Community Progress Association, the Lasiandra Festival, and the Wauchope Chamber of Commerce and Industry. She has been on the management committee of Pembrooke Hall; she has worked for Radio 2Way

        and the Wauchope Show Society; and she is chair of the Wauchope Centenary of Rail celebration and also chair of the Wauchope Junior Rugby League Football Club. She has been a longstanding scripture teacher at Wauchope Public School and Beechwood Public School. She is warden at

        </a>
        and is on the Parochial Council at St Matthew's Anglican Church. She has also volunteered at and helped set up the Pregnancy Help Group. In accepting her Australia Day award, she said that her message to everyone was simple: love one another and do the best we canâ€”what a classic Jeannette comment. She is such a wonderful treasure of a person.

        I was also pleased to spend Australia Day in Gloucester, where I was able to personally congratulate Di Relf, who was awarded Gloucester's Citizen of the Year for her selfless work with the Gloucester Community Shop, which sees all of its profits returned to community groups and organisations. Di was absolutely stunned to win and felt privileged to receive the award.

Not only is he the vice-president of Club Harrington and president of their Travelling Bowlers Club, but also he is active in gardening groups and in Harrington Waters community transport, and he has been a member of the

        Special recognition was also afforded to the late Adam Nixon through a posthumous Citizenship Award. The late Adam, with his family, owned and operated the Harrington Hotel, which I've visited many times. He was a tireless worker for the community. He sponsored local sporting and many community projects. Adam's wife, Shauna, and family members accepted the award for him.
