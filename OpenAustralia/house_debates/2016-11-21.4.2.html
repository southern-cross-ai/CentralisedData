        I present the following ministerial response to a petition previously presented:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Ross Vasta
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your correspondence of 12 October 2016 enclosing Petition
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PN" rel="nofollow">
         PN

        0001, concerning children in immigration detention. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1967 Protocol (the Refugees Convention), Australia takes its international obligations seriously. Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Refugees Convention and other relevant international treaties to which Australia is a party.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government views immigration detention as an essential component of strong border control. Immigration detention supports Australia's well-managed migration system and is used to identify individuals and manage potential risks to the Australian community, including national security, health and character risks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Immigration detention is subject to both administrative and judicial review, and to full parliamentary scrutiny for accountability. The length and conditions of detention are subject to regular review by senior Department of Immigration and Border Protection officers and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whereas Australia's immigration detention population previously comprised mainly illegal maritime arrivals (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
         IMA
        </a>
        s), the current profile indicates that visa overstayers and those who have had their visas cancelled under the character test of section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 predominate. Of the last group, many have been found guilty of serious criminal offences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Significant headway has been made over the past year to reduce the number of children in held detention. From a peak of 1,992 children as at 31 July 2013, the number of IMA children in held detention was reduced to zero as at 1 April 2016.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There will be occasions where children transit through immigration detention; this can be due to airport turnarounds, people who are in the final stages of removal from Australia, or due to criminal or security issues. The Department will continue to work to resolve matters involving any children and their families in held detention as quickly as possible and, where possible, will progress their release into the community as a priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Health care services for detainees are comparable to those available to the Australian community, under the Australian public health system. Services are provided through on-site primary and mental health clinics with referral to allied and specialist health providers, as required. Acute care is provided by hospitals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In line with state and territory government legal requirements, all school-aged children living in the community are required to enrol in school. This includes IMA children living in the community on a bridging visa or in community detention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. Yours sincerely
       </p>
