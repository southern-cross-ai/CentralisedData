        , together with the minutes of proceedings. I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the House take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”This report had its genesis in the 2014 inquiry by the House infrastructure and communications committee into infrastructure planning and procurement. During that inquiry, the infrastructure and communications committee received evidence outlining exciting new developments in the application of smart
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        to infrastructure. The committee determined to explore this further and the smart ICT inquiry was born. The inquiry began under the House infrastructure and communications committee, led by its chair, Mrs Jane Prentice. In October 2015, that committee was disbanded and two new committees were formed. This inquiry was adopted and completed by the House Infrastructure, Transport and Cities Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a testament to the importance attached to this inquiry that former committee members, and particularly the former chair, have maintained a close interest in its progress and outcome. During the inquiry, the committee recognised the increasing possibilities inherent in new technologies and systems. These technologies, if used effectively, can transform the design, construction and management of infrastructure assets, and improve the operation of transport, communications, energy and utility systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        These technologies are transformational, with the capacity to increase the productivity of the Australian economy. In order to achieve this, however, governments and industry must be aware of the potential of smart ICT and must invest in the technologies, skills and systems to make the transformation a reality. That is the core of this report.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its recommendations, the report urges the government to take a more coordinated and integrated approach to the development of smart ICT and its application to infrastructure planning. The central recommendation of the report is the formation of a smart infrastructure task force based on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        model. This task force will provide national coordination between governments, industry and researchers for the development and implementation of smart ICT in the design, planning and development of infrastructure and in the maintenance and optimisation of existing infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of capacity within and between governments is central to a successful task force, and several recommendations address this issue. The committee considers that the collection and management of data is the key to the development of smart infrastructure. Data makes the management of existing systems possible and allows us to explore ever more efficient and effective ways of doing things. Information is the bedrock of innovation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has recommended that the smart infrastructure task force be given responsibility for the national coordination of protocols and standards relating to infrastructure data and the development of an objects library. It has also recommended that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives" rel="nofollow">
         National Archives
        </a>
        of Australia be given the resources to oversee the development of a whole-of-government infrastructure data strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has also recognised the capacity of smart ICT to transform emergency management and disaster planning and remediation. It has called on government to give greater recognition to the capacity of new technologies and systems, including recognizing public safety communications systems as critical infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this inquiry. The committee received a significant amount of high-quality evidence which, nonetheless, only scratched the surface of this fascinating subject. I thank my committee colleagues and the secretariat for their hard work, enthusiasm and patience in seeing this report through the transition between two committees. Lastly, I would like to thank the members of the former infrastructure and communications committee for having the vision to investigate this important issue, and in particular the former chair, Mrs Prentice, for her support in seeing this report through to a successful conclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.
