       <p>
        A long-term strategic vision is required to guide the development of the northern suburbs of Perth, spanning several decades. I take this opportunity to make the case for the federal government to assess the outer north metropolitan region of Perth as a high-priority area to implement its City Deals program. In particular I refer to the area surrounding Yanchep, Alkimos and Joondalup. Through strategic investment in infrastructure and decentralisation, this region can be activated into a thriving and vibrant metropolis. There is synergy in the development of Joondalup, Alkimos and Yanchep.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to develop Perth's northern metropolitan coastal corridor, we must look beyond arbitrary electoral boundaries. A regional approach to infrastructure in our broader north-west suburban corridor is essential for the development of the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo. This region spans a large area covering three federal electorates, namely Moore, Pearce and Cowan. Cooperation is essential to achieve the best strategic outcomes for the region as a whole and see cities such as Alkimos, Yanchep and Joondalup develop to their full potential. Population growth will provide the critical mass of consumers necessary to drive market demand, economic development and, in turn, commercial viability.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a requirement to improve transport linkages to the agricultural hinterland to the east. The establishment of a regional employment node at Muchea requires improvements in the transport linkages from Muchea across to the more populous suburbs along the northern coastal suburbs. This will link Muchea as a hub for agriculture and the gateway to the state's mining and resources industry via the

        with Yanchep, Joondalup and Perth. Better connectivity will capitalise on the recently completed NorthLink project and other investments in the Perth to Darwin highway, which has been funded by the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yanchep City Centre has been designed as a transit-oriented city. A successful city at Yanchep is critical to the overall economic development of the north-west corridor of the Perth metropolitan area. The extension of the

        between Butler and Yanchep. The federal government has also funded the Yanchep rail extension, which is to be constructed by the end of 2021. This rail extension is crucial to the attraction of investment and employment to the corridor. Private sector involvement is essential, with the Yanchep Beach Joint Venture working cooperatively with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Transport_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Public Transport Authority
        </a>
        to provide an appropriate transport interchange in Yanchep City Centre. Yanchep is one of the last greenfield strategic metropolitan centres to be developed in Perth, carefully designed to be a city of the 21st century including high-speed telecommunications infrastructure and accommodation for electric and autonomous vehicles. As it develops, Yanchep City Centre could be a suitable location for trials of both electric and autonomous vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further investment is required in higher-education facilities, with the establishment of a university campus and vocational education and training facilities to promote research and development and the commercialisation of intellectual capital. The Yanchep Beach Joint Venture has invested in the economic development infrastructure in the form of the Y-hub business incubator, which combines an innovation and enterprise hub with a co-working space to support emerging small businesses. Similarly, there is an innovative partnership with the

        in establishing a cooperative research centre for research into honey bee products. This federally-funded project is designed to resolve industry problems which limit both the value and the expansion of the Australian honey bee products industry. The CRC will also contribute to disease-prevention measures to address a major global biosecurity threat to our Australian honey bees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Visionary development with strategic investment will place Perth's northern metropolitan region on the map, with exciting residential and commercial opportunities for decades to come. Residential amenity in a pristine natural environment, located close to local employment opportunities, with access to world-class services and digital connectivity will be the hallmarks of our master-planned region. There is synergy in the coordinated development of Joondalup, Alkimos and Yanchep.
