        It is the time of year for the famous, indeed world-renowned, Jacaranda Festival, which is held annually in Grafton. It begins on the last weekend of October and runs until the first weekend in November. I invite you to attend, Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, if you have not before. It is a week full of a lot of fun activities. The very first festival was held in 1934 and was Australia's first folk festival. It is also Australia's oldest floral festival, with community engagement still a strong as ever. We focus the celebration around the first Thursday of November, which is the iconic Jaca Thursday. This half-day public holiday sees the main street closed and traders taking to the street in colourful displays of acting, singing and performances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another tradition is the crowning of the Jacaranda Queen. This year there are four hopeful queens, who will be guided through their quest by the watchful eye of the matron of honour, Debbie Bowling. Debbie herself was nominated this year by Judy McSwan and she was honoured to be the festivals 81st matron of honour. The four vying for this year's title of the Jacaranda Festival Queen are Kirsten Knox, who is sponsored by the South Grafton Ex-Servicesmen's Club; Kahlia Payne, who is sponsored by the Clarence Coast Riders; Leah Wallace, who is sponsored by the
        <i>
         Daily Examiner
        </i>
        ; and Charlotte White, who is sponsored by Westpac Grafton. We also have five girls vying for junior princess honours. Meggie Ryder is a talented 13-year-old and attends

        ; Madeleine Viddler is a 14-year-old performer, who has competed in many dance styles; Abigail Kennedy is a 12-year-old South Grafton high school student; Grace Spies is a 13-year-old, who is in year 8 at

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Laura Hall
        </a>
        is 14 years old and attends McAuley Catholic College. The festival's special guest this year is Stella Wilson, nee Cooper. Stella was born in 1934, the first year of the festival. She first took part in the festival when she was in kindergarten and continued her involvement throughout her primary and secondary years, performing at every festival. In 1955 Stella was crowned the Jacaranda Festival Queen.

        Of course, like all events, there are a multitude of people who work tirelessly in the background. The Jacaranda committee do an outstanding job in putting together this huge event. I would like to acknowledge the following people: the president, Trevor Green; the vice president, Helen Weatherstone; the festival coordinator,

        I would also like to talk today about Bounce Back From Disasters in Kyogle.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday" rel="nofollow">
         Last Thursday

        night I had the opportunity to go and look at the hard work of the Kyogle
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        , who recently hosted the Bounce Back From Disasters event in Kyogle. This event gave members of the Kyogle community information about what to do in disasters. It also introduced them to the responders and service providers in the community that are best placed to help during and after a disaster. Thanks to this event, we are all more informed and know who the local emergency management team are.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event included speakers from all of our local emergency services agencies and representatives from volunteer groups.

Assistant Inspector Andrew Synott from the Kyogle police, a representative from the Department of Families and Community Services and Jen Haberecht from the Department of Primary Industry also presented information to the community. Robyn Cahill and Pat Saville were also two special guests. They were
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">

        made sandwiches for the event. The Kyogle Lions Club donated drinks and put on a barbeque for those attending. The idea for the event came from a leaders forum. I acknowledge the executive involved in getting this event together: Nicola Mercer, Noelle Lynden-Way,

        One of the highlights of the evening was the Drama in Rural Towns students performing a short one-act play called
        <i>
         Resilience
        </i>
        . The program is an initiative of the Village Hall Players, a touring theatre company which offers young people eight to 17 years old an opportunity to participate in all aspects of theatre, from acting to singing to directing to sound and lighting, in both Kyogle and Casino.
        <i>
         Resilience
        </i>
        was written by the students and workshopped under the direction of Lynette Zito. The premise of the play is that children who were in some way involved in a flood in Kyogle are interviewed for a national kids news television program one year later. They were to talk to kid journalist Sophie—played by Erin Walsh—about their fears and problems during the flood and what they learned. The students involved were: Erin Walsh, Sinead Jolliffe, Tanea Attwood, Faith Chivers, Chloe Chivers, Anika Seegel, Scarlett Barron-Duncan, Jess Cochrane, Emmilee Taylor, Henry Nettleton and Brooke Walsh. I acknowledge those students; they put on a great performance.

        I would also like to acknowledge today a Lismore local, Dave Alley, who has just completed a record-breaking run around Australia. He arrived back in Lismore on Sunday—I just missed him; I was flying out of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lismore_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Lismore Airport
        </a>
        at three o'clock and he was coming by just after that, so I could not say hello to him as he ran by. He has run 80 kilometres—close to two marathons—every day since April 19. He is quoted as saying:
       </p>
       <p>
        I have never looked more forward to seeing that Lismore sign more than I did today—
       </p>
       <p>
        after arriving at Oakes Oval in Lismore. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I won't lie, it was tough, the toughest thing I have ever done in my life. Second only to leaving these guys—
       </p>
       <p>
        his wife and children—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        at home, that was really hard as well. To see them today was really special I will never forget that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Alley said that remaining in constant touch with supporters via social media had been crucial during his marathon effort:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The support has been overwhelming, that is what has got me through …
       </p>
       <p>
        He said the messages of support 'made me get up every day and push on to get those 80 kilometres every day.' He went on:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into this. There were several times as we went around when it could have fallen apart. I had my fair share of setbacks and injuries but we got on with what we had to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dave completed the 13,383km milestone in a record 169 days. Dave, what you have done has been inspirational. He also raised a lot of money for a charity, so I thank and acknowledge Dave for that.
