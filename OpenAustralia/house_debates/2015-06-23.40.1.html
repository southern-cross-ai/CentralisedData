        My question is to the Prime Minister. Last month, when asked if the power to strip citizenship from dual nationals would be exercised at a minister's discretion, the Prime Minister said, 'That is correct.' What made the Prime Minister change his mind on his citizenship proposal between then and now?

         As I have said all along on this matter, the government's position is to strip citizenship from terrorists who are dual nationals. That was the announcement that was made by me and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. That has been the constant position of this government. We have always been determined to do this. We have always been determined to do this in the best possible way. We have always been determined to do this without prior judicial process. That is exactly what we have done. That is exactly what will be done by the legislation that is introduced into the parliament tomorrow. I want to say how well the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has worked with his colleagues, particularly with the Attorney-General, to come up with a piece of legislation which entirely realises the clear policy objective of this government. Our objective is to keep our country safe. Our objective is to strip the citizenship from terrorists who are dual nationals. Our objective is to ensure that if you are a terrorist you are never going to be loose on the streets of this country. That is what this government will do, and I look forward to the support of the Labor Party in making this come about.

           I thank the member for Hindmarsh very much. He is part of our committee that looks at ways in which this government can make our society even safer for Australians. It is a very important job that he does. I want to say thank you very much to a couple of members, including the member for Bass, the member for Wannon and other members on our side of the House who have engaged very constructively in the way in which we can improve the Australian law to protect Australians. The reality is that since September of last year our country has faced two terrorist attacks. The authorities have thwarted six attacks, and 23 people have been charged with terrorist related offences. So the threat for us—the threat for the United Kingdom, for the United States and for other western democracies—only increases every single day. These people seek to attack our way of life. They seek to destroy the lives of innocent Australians. And this government intends to stop them. We have said through this legislation in relation to dual nationals that if they are terrorists, if they seek to do harm to the Australian public, we will do whatever we can under this law to prevent them from coming back to Australia. If they are convicted of an offence in Australia then there is, by their own conduct, an automatic renunciation of their Australian citizenship. If it is the case that they are involved in a situation of fighting for or serving with a particular proscribed organisation there is, by their own conduct, an automatic renunciation of their Australian citizenship. These are very important principles. They adhere to the rule of law, they align us with our international obligations and they really, I think, provide a great opportunity to keep the Australian public safe.

              I do not believe so, Madam Speaker, but if it helps the House I am happy to withdraw it. What I said was that the member for Isaacs interjected, as he did last week, into this debate. He made a very interesting interjection into this debate: he advocated bringing these terrorists back to Australia. That is a complete outrage. It is an abrogation of his responsibility. They hid him for a couple days.

                  The reality is that even the Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed by the conduct of the member for Isaacs.

                   Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under a ruling you gave some time ago, if someone wants to make an objection under standing order 68 then only the member concerned can raise that objection. That is exactly what the member for Isaacs was attempting to do—

                    I am telling you that the member for Isaacs has continually during this period attempted to interrupt. Therefore, I am not giving him the call. Now, resume your seat. The minister has the call.

                     It cannot be out of order in this case to quote the member for Isaacs directly. We have a bill here that will make Australians safer and we look forward to support from the opposition.
