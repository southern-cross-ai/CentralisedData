        to accommodate the planned acquisition of large technology objects. The Treloar collections storage facility at Mitchell is an essential asset and is the Australian War Memorial's conservation facility and store for large pieces of military equipment, including aircraft, vehicles, boats, missiles and guns.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an immediate requirement for increased collection storage as there is a significant planned handover of collections from the

        once additional storage capacity is available. These include a P-3 Orion, C-130 Hercules, F/A-18 Classic Hornet, and Seahawk and Squirrel naval helicopters which are due to be retired in the coming decade. It is quite a collection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will provide approximately 5,288 square metres of total floor space. No internal fitout is proposed. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $16.1 million, excluding

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to provide explosive ordnance logistics infrastructure right across Australia. Defence's explosive ordnance logistics network is a key enabler to capabilities of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        . The project will provide new infrastructure for the explosive ordnance network, including storage, processing and administrative facilities. The proposed facilities will modernise and align the capacity of the network within the ADF's current operational tempo.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the project is approximately $230.9 million, excluding GST. This includes the construction costs, management design fees, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and an escalation allowance. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2018 and to be completed by late 2020 in all areas. I commend the motion to the House.

        2008 Phase 5B2 Wideband Satellite Capability—Satellite Ground Station—East Facilities Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct facilities to support a satellite ground station at Kapooka Military Area near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">

         New South Wales
        </a>
        in the fine electorate of Riverina. The project will provide facilities to enable anchoring of enhanced wideband satellite communications. The proposed works will involve the construction of a transmission building, foundations for three satellite dishes and associated supporting infrastructure and engineering services. The proposed site is an open field inside the southern boundary of the Kapooka Military Area, and the facility will be serviced by a small number of maintenance personnel and operated remotely.
       </p>
       <p>
        The capital investment in the infrastructure will bring economic benefits to the local economy during construction and throughout its ongoing sustainment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $34 million excluding GST. This includes the construction costs, professional service fees, management fees, contingencies and an allowance for escalation.
       </p>

        The Kapooka army base in Wagga Wagga is the unmistakable home of the Australian soldier. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">

         Australian Defence Force Academy
        </a>
        in Canberra, the basic training of every recruit—each and every one of them—to the Australian Army happens at Kapooka.
       </p>
       <p>
        The significance of the Defence family to Wagga Wagga cannot be overstated, and to see those soldiers march out on their graduation parades is always a pleasure. I know the work of army leadership, including Kapooka's new commandant, Mick Garraway, is something my community and the whole nation appreciates. This motion today builds on that future. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the satellite ground station is scheduled to commence in mid-2018 and is expected to be completed by late 2019. I commend this important motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The project will provide opportunities to improve current site environmental conditions by addressing inefficiencies in engineering services. The project will have a positive social and economic benefit for the region, with the total number of personnel directly engaged by the project estimated at 1,100 over the proposed delivery time frame. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $463.1 million excluding GST. This includes the construction costs, management and design fees, furniture, information and communications technology, fitting and equipment, contingencies and an allowance for escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in late 2017 and be completed in mid-2025. I commend the motion to the House.

        is proposing to renew its tenancy, undertake a building refresh and introduce enhanced amenities at its head office in Discovery House, Woden, in the Australian Capital Territory. The building refresh will provide a new, modern fit-out, and create an efficient, adaptable and sustainable workplace designed to support flexible work practices, provide a childcare facility and achieve the whole-of-government occupational density target of 14 square metres of office space per occupied work point.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is anticipated that at the conclusion of the works, 2,000 square metres of surplus office space will become available to sublet to another government agency. The estimated cost to deliver this project is $39.7 million, excluding GST. This includes all capital construction works, fixtures, fittings and furniture, design, project management and consultancy costs. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in 2018 and be completed by December 2019.
