       </p>
       <p>
        The bill we introduced on 14 March 2013 included a statutory obligation for political parties to provide a list of their election commitments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
         PBO
        </a>
        . Those lists were to form the basis of the election commitments that the PBO would cost in its post-election report. The reason for this approach was simple: political parties should be accountable and responsible for telling the public and the Parliamentary Budget Office what their election commitments are. We believed that requiring political parties to provide their list of election commitments to the PBO would be sufficient, that that would be enough to achieve what we all agree in this place should be the proper process. However, more work needs to be done here—and that is why we are moving these amendments—as political parties may choose to play games or obfuscate their responsibilities with the PBO's post-election report. This could mean that they do not provide the PBO with their list of election commitments at all or provide incomplete, ambiguous or even downright misleading information. This would be inexcusable. It would not be in keeping with the law and it would go completely against what the government is trying to achieve with these reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we are moving amendments to make sure that the parties now and into the future cannot mess around with the PBO's post-election report. The amendments I have moved will strengthen the approach outlined in the bill to determine the list of election commitments to be included in the post-election report. These amendments still rely on the fundamental premise that parties have to comply with their statutory obligations to provide a list of their election commitments to the PBO before polling day. However, they also mean that parties will be completely caught out if they only tell the PBO half the story, half-truths or nothing at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments I have moved will mean that the PBO will be the ultimate arbiter of what election commitments are to be included in the post-election report. The PBO will prepare lists of election commitments the PBO then reasonably believes will have a material impact on the budget. The PBO's list will be based on the lists the parties gave to the PBO and the public announcements of the parties before and during the caretaker period. So the PBO will run the ruler over the lists that the parties gave them and reconcile them with the election commitments the parties have announced.
       </p>
       <p>
        There may well be differences between the lists of election commitments parties give to the PBO and what the PBO consider those parties' election commitments are. As I mentioned before, this could be due to the fact that the lists do not fully reflect what parties said publicly. Where there are differences, the PBO will provide reasons if they diverge from the lists that the parties gave to them. Where a party chooses not to provide a list at all, the PBO will put together their own comprehensive list using their best professional judgement. Of course, parties will have the chance to comment on the PBO's list, and the PBO may take the parties' comments into account. Further, to be abundantly transparent, the PBO will be required to justify why each specific election commitment has been included in the post-election report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst we have preferred to rely on parties complying with their statutory obligations, we are now going further to ensure that the post-election report will expose anyone trying to evade budget scrutiny. The bill as introduced would allow the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        to provide confidential taxpayer information to the PBO for the purpose of the PBO performing its statutory functions. However, the PBO does not require access to specific identifying information about taxpayers in order to carry out its statutory functions effectively. Like the Treasury, it needs only de-identified information to carry out its policy-costing work. For that reason, I am moving an amendment to provide that only information that does not include the name, contact details or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABN" rel="nofollow">
         ABN
        </a>
        of any entity may be provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        to the PBO under this provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the government is moving an amendment on behalf of the Presiding Officers. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives have asked that I move an amendment to the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to remove the requirement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer be a member of the Security Management Board. The President and the Speaker note that the PBO, unlike the other parliamentary departments, has no role in the management of security for the parliamentary precincts. I am advised that the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself agrees with this amendment, and I commend these amendments to the House.

        Question agreed to.
