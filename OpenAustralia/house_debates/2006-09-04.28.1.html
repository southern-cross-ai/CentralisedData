       <p>
        I would like to recognise the Isaacs winners of this year’s federal sports awards. The awards recognise not only high achievers on the field but also those tireless people behind the scenes in administration, fundraising and the social life of our sporting clubs. Leonie Zapf is a life member of Carrum Bowls Club—she has been a member for 30 years and has coached at the club for 12 years. She is in her seventh year as club secretary and has been a Victorian Ladies Bowls Association delegate for over 15 years. Brett Wright from the Edithvale-Aspendale Football Club has been with the club since he was 13 years old. He continues his commitment to the club as a coach. Brett’s involvement with the Mornington Peninsula Football League spans 30 years.
       </p>

        The ladies’ section of the Mordialloc Bowls Club was recognised in its entirety for consistent sporting achievements and charitable fundraising. Karl Krings and Geoff King from Keysborough Bowls Club were both winners—Geoff for his years of effort both as club president and in his current role of secretary, and Karl for his many outstanding performances for the club at the local and regional levels.

        from Keysborough Football Club was recognised for almost 40 years of involvement with the club. I congratulate all of these winners and thank them for their contribution to the life of our local community.
