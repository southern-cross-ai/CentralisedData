       <p class="italic">
        A person may apply to the Tribunal for review of an ART social services decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most ART social services decisions are decisions made by the Tribunal on review of social services decisions. However, some ART social services decisions are made originally by the Tribunal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In general, the Tribunal must deal with an application for review of an ART social services decision in the same way as it would deal with a reviewable decision of that kind.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, this general rule is modified by Division 3 of this Part, and may also be modified by regulations made under this Part.

       <p class="italic">
        An application cannot be made under section 123 to refer a decision of the Tribunal on review of a social services decision, or a decision of the Tribunal on second review, to the guidance and appeals panel.

        131B How this Part applies

        The government is moving amendments to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, the ART bill. These amendments will strengthen the Administrative Review Tribunal model for enhancements to appointment processes, the mechanism for review and the model for social security and others social security bills. In developing these amendments, we've listened to feedback from stakeholders and the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Policy" rel="nofollow">
         Social Policy
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Legal Affairs
        </a>
        . In addition, minor and technical amendments will ensure that the provisions work as intended, correct minor oversights and clarify the operation of the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the amendments will require the government of the day to appoint and use assessment panels when undertaking merit based appointment for all tribunal members, strengthening the bill's already robust appointment provisions. Under the amendments, the minister will only be permitted to appoint members if they have been recommended through the merit based process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the amendments will reinstate a second review process as a right for parties to review of social services decisions where two-tier review currently exists before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
         AAT
        </a>
        . This responds to concerns from those who work on this kind of appeal. Amending the ART Bill to provide a second review by right for social security matters where it currently exists is intended to support a smoother transition to the new tribunal for these types of cases. Reviews in the tribunal must be informal, accessible and quick, and responsive to the diverse needs of parties. The speed, informality and nonadversarial nature of the current AAT first review is important to retain under the new model. The government expects that the greater ability to tailor the first review to the particular matter will reduce the need for second reviews over time while retaining the speed, accessibility and informality of the first review. However, these amendments provide time to ensure the objectives of the new model are being met.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within three years of establishing the new tribunal, the government proposes to evaluate the impact and efficacy of the review model for social services decisions, including whether reviews at both levels are informal, quick, accessible and trauma informed. My department and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services

        will work with stakeholders on the best way to progress this program of work. The tribunal's practice directions will be an important part of shaping how the tribunal's powers and procedures will be exercised to deliver accessible, informal and quick review. I understand the AAT is already giving close consideration to the best way to engage stakeholders, including legal assistance providers, advocates and people with lived experience, in the initial design and continuous improvement of the practice directions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the bill is amended to more clearly reflect supported rather than substituted decision-making, including by changing the term 'litigation guardian' to 'litigation supporter'. This change responds to comments from the disability sector during the committee process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, these amendments require a statutory review of the bill and related bills to commence just before the five-year anniversary of the commencement of the bill, ensuring proper assessment of the overall reform. This review, to be conducted by an independent eminent expert or a panel with expertise in administrative law, would be a broad-ranging and holistic examination of the bill and the consequential amendments. The statutory review must also consider the implementation of the legislation, including the tribunal's operations and whether it is achieving its objective.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, these amendments demonstrate the government's commitment to listening to stakeholders and ensuring the new tribunal is user focused, efficient and fair.

         I rise today to speak in support of the government's amendments. These bills represent the biggest reform to administrative law in a generation; it's hard to overstate the importance. The success or failure of the tribunal will impact thousands of Australians every year, whether accessing our social services, migration, health care or tax systems. At the core of the government's administrative reforms is a commitment to be rid of the crony jobs-for-mates culture that pervaded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
          AAT
         </a>
         in its later years. Delivering on this promise starts with getting the appointment process right, with no room for dodgy deals or political nepotism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians were promised a transparent selection process that would see only the most qualified and experienced people appointed to the tribunal. But this was not what was proposed in the bills first introduced to the House, and I had significant concerns, and I made these clear to the Attorney-General. So let me be clear now: there were significant flaws in the bills. There was no requirement to use selection panels and no clear requirement for the Attorney-General to refer to the panel's recommendations. Without amendment, the bills were quite simply incomplete, with inadequate safeguards against politicisation. And, with such a stumble at its biggest hurdle, I was disappointed with that first iteration, to say the least, because, as Professor Mary Crock has said, the success of the new tribunal will be marked by the quality of the individuals appointed to adjudicate actual cases. So I commend the government for responding to the crossbench's calls, and in particular the calls from the member for Mackellar.
        </p>
        <p>
         These amendments will not only require the use of selection panels but also ensure that the Attorney-General can only recommend a candidate for appointment if they have been found as suitable by a selection panel through a merits based process. I am hopeful that these amendments will deliver on the merits based process that this government promised, but only time will tell.
        </p>
        <p>
         In coming years, we will want to know if the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ART" rel="nofollow">
          ART
         </a>
         has delivered for Australians and whether the goal of creating a fairer and more accountable decision review system has indeed been achieved. To answer these questions, first we need to ask them, which is why I am supportive of amendments requiring a review of the ART in five years time. This review will be conducted by experts in administrative law and must include public consultation. This crucial review clause was missing when the bill was first introduced into this place. I found that concerning and, frankly, also very disappointing. But in this 47th Parliament we have a crossbench who won't settle for incomplete legislation. We have held the government accountable to its commitments and called for it to do better. Without the strong advocacy of the crossbench, and particularly the member for Warringah, this amendment would not have seen the light of day.
        </p>
        <p>
         While I would have preferred a legislative review within three years of the act's operation, I recognise the importance of having this review locked down in the calendar so we can look back in five years time and ask whether the new ART truly is the once-in-a-generation reform that we've been promised. Yet again, the introduction of this amendment shows the power that community Independents can have in the parliament. With the government having responded to crossbench calls, I now feel I am able to give these bills my full support. I commend these amendments to the House.

         </small>
         <p>
          I would also like to thank the Attorney-General for the introduction of these amendments and being very open to consultation with the crossbench about these amendments. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
           Administrative Appeals Tribunal
          </a>
          was one of the most important pillars of our democracy. It was abolished for very good reasons, and we thank the Attorney-General for the decision to do that. But it was abolished because it had been politicised and stacked with cronies. In doing so, the competence of this vitally important democratic institution had been undermined, the public's trust in this very important institution had been undermined and one of our democratic values had also been undermined. So it was critically important that the fatal flaw that led to it being abolished in the first place was addressed in the new iteration of the Administrative Review Tribunal.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the member for Indi said, the first iteration of this bill did not address the independence of the appointments process. It did address 'merits based', and we thank the minister for that, but it did not address the independence. That was not sufficiently covered. There was no requirement for there to be the use of assessment panels. There was something in the bill that said assessment panels may be created from time to time, but there was no mandated assessment panel and it was not in the legislation. So we're very happy to see that there are now mandated assessment panels when members are being appointed to the tribunal and it is in the legislation. This is a very important step for our democracy going forward. We know that civil society has been calling for this, the crossbench has been calling for this and the Greens party has been calling for this.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would say I've also been calling for this type of independent appointments process to be taken up on a far greater basis in general. We can't continue to have appointments being made at the minister's discretion, because we know that, in particular, this type of flaw comes down to the politicisation of the appointments process. So it's vitally important that we have a robust and independent appointments process across all Commonwealth public appointments, and that's what my 'ending jobs for mates' bill is calling for. With any major Commonwealth appointment, there needs to be an independent process where assessment panels are used, independent selection panels are used and then the minister may choose from that shortlist. If that doesn't happen, then the minister needs to explain to the parliament why they have chosen from outside that shortlist. This is needed for the integrity of our democracy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Trust in our political system is one of the biggest issues and was one of the biggest issues at the last election. Here on the crossbench, we have been fighting hard in many different ways to rebuild integrity and trust in our political system. I am hopeful that this move by the Attorney-General—and thank you very much—sets a precedent for future important appointments.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also say that I strongly support having a review in five years time. I think that's incredibly important as well. Now, with the new amendments, I also am able to give my full support to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023. I welcome it and welcome very much the work that the Attorney-General and his team have done on this. Thank you.

          <p>
           I would like to note and thank the Attorney-General and his office and team for their engagement in relation to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and the subsequent amendments that we now see. As others have said, it is so important that we have trust and faith in important institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I noted in my speech yesterday, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
            Administrative Appeals Tribunal
           </a>
           plays an incredibly important role because administrative decisions touch on so many areas of people's lives, and it is important that they be able to have a fair appeals process and a timely appeals process at that.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
            AAT
           </a>
           , as it was, was not working well. As a barrister prior to entering politics, I was very aware of the difficulties and the problems with that body. It had been politically stacked. So I very much supported the Attorney-General's decision to abolish the AAT as it was and replace it with the Administrative Review Tribunal.
          </p>
          <p>
           But there were several elements that were incredibly important to insert into the bill. It's good to see the government coming to the table constructively and now to see these amendments being presented. The member for Mackellar moved amendments in relation to the appointment process, making sure that we have a robust merits process for these appointments but also an independent panel to ensure that, when the Attorney-General exercises discretion in relation to appointments, it is about picking from people that have been assessed as qualified and capable for the role and not just making a politically stacked appointment.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is so important that administrative appeal bodies like this are independent, impartial and free from politics. Australians must feel like they're going to get a fair hearing before an administrative review body that can make key decisions affecting their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           So the amendments now being moved by the Attorney-General are very much welcome and in large part address a number of the concerns that many of us have had. A concern I raised was in relation to the statutory review. We are where we are because the previous body had fallen so far from its original purpose and intent and was not working well. It was politically stacked. The amendment the Attorney-General has now presented reflects the amendment I was offering, and I very much welcome that, especially in relation to all the engagement that there's been in relation to this issue. I know many individuals and organisations called for such a review clause to be included in the legislation, because we're not infallible and we need to make sure, through a legislated review process, that the intended changes work as they are meant to. I'd like to acknowledge the work of Catherine Williams from the Centre for Public Integrity for the work she's done with my office—and, I assume, with others—in relation to the concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
           The statutory review clause the government is offering is a little different. Firstly, it's providing for a review to occur within five years rather than three years as I had proposed. But I accept that there is a time line and a process. Secondly, the review panel is left to the minister's discretion. There's no description of what the reviewer's qualifications should be included in the act or the amendment. This is in contrast to the membership of a review panel that I had proposed with my amendments—specifically, that it must comprise three members appointed by the minister and include a former judge of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            High Court of Australia
           </a>
           , of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Federal Court of Australia
           </a>
           or of the supreme court of a state or territory; a person with experience in community advocacy and engagement relating to matters dealt with by this act; and a person with significant knowledge or experience relating to matters dealt with by this act. Those three qualifications would help give confidence that, in the review process, the review panel will have the necessary skills. So I put this question to the Attorney-General: how will he ensure that those appointed as reviewers for the statutory review will be appropriately qualified? What, in fact, does he have in mind or intend in the provision for appointment of a statutory review panel?

           </small>
           <p>
            I thank the member for Warringah for her support for the bill and the amendments, and I would seek to answer the question that she's raised about the qualifications of the reviewer. It's a fairly familiar form now in this parliament that, particularly for new institutions or new legislative arrangements, we provide for a statutory review after some years, particularly when we're making substantial changes, as this new model of an Administrative Review Tribunal does. It is important that we go back and check that we are achieving the objectives of the reform. Clause 294A(4) will set out the required qualifications for the reviewer. It will provide that the reviewer must, in the minister's opinion, have the appropriate expertise in administrative review. It's a clause that I think ensures that the review of the act and of the operation of the tribunal will be conducted by an independent reviewer whom the minister has considered to have the appropriate expertise and requisite knowledge to conduct the review.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that it's possible to say that over the last 20 years or so, where we have provided for statutory reviews, almost invariably appropriate reviewers are appointed. The greater difficulty is making sure that, when a review is conducted, the government of the day acts on the review report. I have in mind there the excellent review of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Disclosure_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Public Interest Disclosure Act
            </a>
            was done by Philip Moss. When that bill passed through the parliament in 2013, appropriately, I, in my capacity as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
             Special Minister of State
            </a>
            at the time, provided for a review and for a reviewer to be appointed. The former government did appoint an appropriate reviewer in Philip Moss, an eminent Australian public servant, but, sadly, he having produced an excellent review of the Public Interest Disclosure Act in 2016, nothing happened.

                Many speakers in the debate on this bill have spoken about what occurred over the last nine years of the former government, and I don't think I need to rehearse that much travelled ground again. We have provided in the bill, strengthened by the amendments I've brought to the House today, for a merit based appointments process for all future appointments to the Administrative Review Tribunal. It's of course the case that any future parliament might choose to again change the method of appointment to this tribunal, but our government is committed to a merit based appointments process. We legislated for merit based appointment processes for the

                </a>
                , in the first bill I brought to this parliament. We are legislating for merit based appointments processes to be required to be used for all future appointments to this Administrative Review Tribunal should it pass through both houses of our parliament.
               </p>
               <p>
                By way of further reassurance, I would point to the record of our government since coming to office in that our government has appointed 115 new members to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">

                </a>
                by using a merit based appointments process not required by the statute at present. Having a mandatory merit based appointments process in future for the Administrative Review Tribunal will cause our government no difficulty at all. I'd perhaps be able to point to the fact, regarding those 115 appointments made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal using merit based appointments processes since the last election, there has not to my knowledge been a breath of criticism of any of the 115 quality members who have been appointed to serve on the tribunal.
