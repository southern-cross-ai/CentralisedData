         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As at 16 June 2011, there are currently 11 operational
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         Super Clinics.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As advised previously, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health and Ageing
         </a>
         provides self reported numbers of service presentations at an aggregated level only. Self reported services numbers for individual clinics are not made publicly available as:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) there are commercial-in-confidence and privacy protection considerations around releasing data at the individual clinic level; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) service numbers are not comparable (depending on when the Clinics commenced services, the size of the community, the number of service providers engaged etc) and could be open to misinterpretation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The current presentation data collection framework was implemented from 1 February 2011. The framework provides for the identification of GP, nursing and allied health presentations and the collection of data every two months by the Department from operational GP Super Clinic sites and those delivering early services.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (aâ€“b) Noting that a number of sites providing early services became operational part way through a reporting period, it is estimated that of the approximately 428,000 presentations at the 11 operational GP Super Clinics sites as at 31 May 2011, approximately 371,000 presentations were while sites were operational and 57,000 were early services provided prior to clinics becoming operational.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Prior to 31 January 2011, there were approximately 289,000 presentations at the eight operational GP Super Clinic sites, including early services that had been delivered, if any, at those sites.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         From 1 February 2011 to 31 March 2011, there were approximately 66,000 presentations at the operational GP Super Clinic sites.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         From 1 April 2011 to 31 May 2011, there were approximately 73,000 presentations at the operational GP Super Clinic sites.
