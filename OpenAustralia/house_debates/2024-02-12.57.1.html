        Wentworth is blessed with some of Australia's most iconic beaches. But, sadly, due to the failures of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state governments and their contractors, one of the community's most treasured swimming spots has now been closed since March 2022. We recently received news that the seawall construction at Nielsen Park had been delayed yet again and that the beach will remain closed until the middle of the year. This is more than 18 months longer than originally promised. My community are extremely disappointed by this failure of procurement and oversight, and I share their frustration at the loss of this important community hub, which will now be closed for two summers. I call on the state government to urgently expedite the works.

        In more positive news, I want to congratulate those in my community and beyond for their advocacy in stopping gas exploration at

        11. PEP11 would have opened up around 5,000 square kilometres of precious ocean environment for fossil fuel extraction an endangered the majestic humpback and southern right whales, which we are privileged to see migrate along our coast each year and must do everything we can to protect. Last week's decision by state government to kill off the project is a victory for my community and many others. I want to pay particular tribute to the independent members of the federal and state parliaments as well as Surfers for Climate and Surfrider Foundation Australia for their advocacy on this issue for many years.
