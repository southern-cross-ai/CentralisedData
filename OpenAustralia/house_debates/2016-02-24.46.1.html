        It is with some emotion that I rise to pay tribute to our former National Party leader and former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for

         Warren Truss
        </a>
        . A lot has been said already about Warren Truss, and I would like to add my gratitude for his work and counsel. He is among the noblest, most gracious and honest characters within this parliamentary chamber. After 25 years in the Australian parliament, he is a person with the utmost dignity and integrity and will be sadly missed. As a fellow Queenslander, he has always had time to listen to the needs of my electorate of Capricornia in

        . He took the time on many occasions to visit this region, including Rockhampton, Mackay, Eton Range and Yeppoon. Most recently, in his former role as Deputy Prime Minister, he visited Rockhampton to officially open the $170 million stage 2 Yeppen South flood plain project on the
