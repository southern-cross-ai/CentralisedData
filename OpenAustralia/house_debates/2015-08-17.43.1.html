       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to recognise an outstanding resident from Forde who is heading to Brazil this month to represent Australia at the 43rd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldSkills_Competition" rel="nofollow">
         WorldSkills Competition
        </a>
        . Mundoolun electrician and former Park Ridge State High School student, Luke Schaenzel, has been selected as a member of the 2015 Skillaroos in the Manufacturing Team Challenge category. I had the opportunity to catch up with Luke recently, and he is an outstanding young man who has put many hours of hard work and commitment into this competition. He is part of a team of three, and their challenge is to build a forklift that can perform a number of functions. The challenge is over 22 hours over three days and, on the fourth day, they have to test out the forklift's abilities with an obstacle course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke tells me that he has been meeting with his team every fortnight, and his employer has been very supportive of his involvement with the Skillaroos. Their intense training regime in the lead-up to the competition will not only help the Skillaroos vie for the title of world champion in their chosen profession but will further refine and develop their trade and technical skills. Luke and his other team members have been working closely with their trainers, employers and mentors to ensure they are equipped with the skills and confidence necessary to compete against competitors from across the world, and he has high hopes of bringing home a medal for Australia.
