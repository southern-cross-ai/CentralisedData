       <p>
        When I speak in the adjournment debate, I like to raise issues that are very prevalent within the electorate I represent. In Shortland, one of the biggest issues in recent times has surrounded Centrelink and waiting times, and the inability to access appointments and to be able to discuss issues with Centrelink officers. Changes have happened. I understand that Centrelink is very stretched because of the drastic cuts to staff that have taken place. But Shortland is an older electorate, and, when a pensioner turns up at the Centrelink office, staff walk up and greet them—and the staff are very polite—and tell them to use the computer. Some constituents find this overwhelming. They feel very threatened by this. Alternatively, constituents are also given a number to ring if they do not want to try the computer.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is story after story of people ringing that number, waiting for half an hour, three-quarters of an hour or an hour, only to find that they are then cut off, and they are back where they started. At one of my seniors forums at Belmont about two weeks ago, Centrelink came along. The presentation by Centrelink was fantastic. The Centrelink officer comes and makes presentations at most of my seniors forums and she does a wonderful job. She meets and talks to people during the lunchbreak. But, overwhelmingly, seniors raise the issue of the lack of service and their inability to cope with Centrelink the way it is operating for her. The minister has addressed some of the issues I have raised, but this issue goes on and on. This is also the case with Medicare payments; when a person goes in, they are directed—once again—to a computer. I need the government to understand that computer technology and using computers is a fantastic and efficient way to do things. To do things online is great, but not everybody can do it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people I represent in this parliament are very upset about this push to make them use computers when they are extremely uncomfortable about using them. They are very disappointed with the way Centrelink are delivering their services at the moment. I am particularly concerned, and I have spoken to the minister's office. They were quite helpful. The combined Medicare and Centrelink office at Belmont, in my area, had their lease come up for renewal recently. They had a three-year lease. The retailer offered them a five-year lease but they did not want that. The retailer then offered them a three-year lease—and they were really favourable terms, much better terms than they have at the moment—but they did not want that either. In the end, they agreed to a one-year lease.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a Medicare office the Howard government closed. It is a Medicare office that Labor, when in government, reopened with the extra Centrelink service available. It was a Centrelink service that used to give people appointments but now no longer does this, because they are not allowed to. The fact that the lease is only being extended for a year is a great concern for me, which is why I call on the government to ensure that the Medicare Centrelink office remains in the Belmont area—an area where there are a lot of elderly people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by adding my voice to the many calls from people on this side of the parliament who are asking the new Prime Minister to stay true to his values and not just cater to the conservative elements within the Liberal Party. Leadership means nothing if you do not stand up for what you believe in. You need to be what you believe in. You need to stand up for the people you represent. You do not need to be a second-rate Prime Minister who only caters to the needs of those in your party.
