        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Investment. Will the minister outline to the House the importance of a well-regulated building and construction industry to decisions investors make about Australia as an attractive place to do business?

         I thank the member for Wright for his question. I know the member for Wright, like all members on this side of the chamber, is very committed to a well-regulated building and construction industry. Frankly, it stands in contrast to the opposition. But can I go very directly to the question that was asked. This government understands the strong link between a well-regulated building and construction industry and foreign investment and the ability of foreign investment to drive jobs and growth in the Australian economy. We welcome foreign investment into this country to help develop opportunities, to help drive jobs and to help drive growth. But it is crucial, in order for investors to have confidence, that they must know, when they invest in an Australian project, that their investment will be subject to a strong regulatory framework. The Howard government understood this, and that is the precise reason why the Howard government introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission, so that we had a strong cop on the beat, as was recommended by the Cole royal commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, though, what we saw was that the political arm of the Australian trade union movement, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         , abolished that. They abolished the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
          ABCC
         </a>
         , and what was the consequence? We saw almost immediately industrial disputation going up. We saw lawlessness come back. And the Heydon royal commission clearly demonstrated that there was thuggery involved. Those opposite now go to great lengths to defend the thuggery that we see in the industry. This side of the chamber is absolutely committed to reinstate the ABCC. But what does the opposition say? What do we know the member for Gorton had to say when he was asked about the culture in the industry? He turned around and he said, 'It's a rough and tough industry.' That is their attitude when it comes to regulation of the building and construction industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we saw, for example, fines that were imposed on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         and five officials for blocking a Queensland government housing project site in Brisbane, Justice Logan said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The individual respondents in this case are exemplars of the union organisers and delegates displaying a disregard or contempt for the rule of law.
        </p>
        <p>
         What do those opposite say? 'It's a rough and tough industry.' That is the message that we continue to see the Labor Party send to international investors. When we saw fines imposed on the CFMEU and its officials for breaching right-of-entry laws at Sydney domestic airport, Justice Flick said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They behaved in a manner which was abusive and misleading. Their conduct can only be described as contemptuous of the limits to their power and the people on site with whom they were dealing.
        </p>
        <p>
         What do opposition members say? 'It's a rough and tough industry.' That attitude will never welcome investors. That is not the guarantee investors are looking for, and we will provide a well-regulated industry.
