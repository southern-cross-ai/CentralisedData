         Red Nose Day
        </a>
        is held annually on the last Friday in June and is the major fundraiser for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIDS" rel="nofollow">
         SIDS
        </a>
        . Tomorrow is Red Nose Day’s 21st birthday. I hope I can speak for all parliamentarians to wish Red Nose Day in the campaign against SIDS a very happy 21st for tomorrow. SIDS and Kids is an international leader in the field of health promotion, dedicated to the elimination of sudden and unexpected infant death. In 2002, SIDS and Kids changed their name to reflect the expansion of services and now provide much needed counselling and support to all Australian families who have suffered the sudden death of an infant or young child. This service is provided free of charge and is available 24 hours a day every day of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1990 SIDS and Kids Safe Sleeping program has been instrumental in reducing the SIDS infant mortality rates by a staggering 90 per cent, equalling more than 4,500 Australian babies’ lives saved every single day. I think we all in parliament support that staggering reduction. The question is: why a red nose? In 1988 the Red Nose Day concept was adopted by SIDS and Kids organisations around Australia. Since then people, cars, buildings and indeed parliamentarians around the nation have joined in the fun, but for a very good and very worthwhile cause. The Red Nose Day always brings a smile to the faces of people, including, of course, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament. Wearing a red nose, whilst we can be seen as somewhat silly and frivolous, is for an outstanding cause. Proceeds from the Red Nose Day assist in providing a range of vital services and programs: a 24 hours a day, 365 days a year crisis outreach and ongoing bereavement support for families and the community following the sudden and unexpected death of an infant or child from 20 weeks to six years; our SIDS and Kids Safe Sleeping program, an evidence based health promotion campaign; and research into the causes and prevention of sudden and unexpected deaths in the perinatal period and infancy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1988, when Red Nose Day first started, 479 Australian babies died from SIDS. With Red Nose Day income, SIDS and Kids organisations funded research and produced the SIDS and Kids Safe Health program campaign leading to a drop to just 73 SIDS deaths in 2003. A million face noses were sold on that very first Australian Red Nose Day raising over $1.3 million. In 1989 two million red face noses were sold nationwide at $1.50 each, and a new button badge costing $2 was included with a picture of a chicken saying, ‘I’m too chicken to wear a red nose’. The price of $2, of course, included a fine of 50c for, frankly, not wearing your red nose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within Fadden, the fastest-growing electorate in the nation, and the electorate I represent, a great organisation called Paradise Kids seeks to work to support those children and those parents who have suffered. Paradise Kids is not for profit. It is a support group for parents, kids and families who have lost a sibling, child or parent. They offer grief and loss counselling. The Paradise Kids program is tailored to all age groups. There is a program run for teens and also one offering one-on-one counselling for all paradise kids and the children that are part of the program. We all here in parliament support many worthy causes. I join my many parliamentary colleagues in wishing SIDS and Kids a very happy 21st birthday for tomorrow. I thank them for their work across the nation in highlighting the need for more research and more investment in the SIDS programs and salute them for their great work in reducing the SIDS rate of death by over 90 per cent.
