        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        I present the committee's report 2 of 2023,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , Cocos (Keeling) Islands airfield upgrade project and other works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's second report for 2023, and I see the deputy chair waiting eagerly on the other side of the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report considers two proposals referred to the committee in November last year with a combined value of just over $600 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first proposal, from the Department of Defence, is for a Cocos (Keeling) Islands airfield upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second proposal, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        , is for the second stage of the Abuja Australian High Commission project in Nigeria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of Defence's airfield upgrade project is to improve the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airfield to support the operation of the Air Force's primary maritime surveillance aircraft—the P-8A Poseidon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cocos (Keeling) Islands are strategically important to Australia's west and uniquely positioned to support defence operations in the Indo-Pacific region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total cost of the proposed project is just under $570 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee noted throughout the inquiry that the project will have a strong impact on the small local community and was pleased to hear from Defence that extensive consultation has been undertaken, with a clear effort made to address community concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee urges Defence to continue a high level of community consultation and to quickly address any problems that might arise during the airfield works.
       </p>
       <p>
        One particular concern is the risk that the project poses to the water source on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Island" rel="nofollow">
         West Island
        </a>
        , which was visited by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main aquifer sits directly under the runway, so water security for the local community is obviously of great concern.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee notes Defence's collaboration with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Infrastructure
        </a>
        , Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to ensure a long-term water source.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreed solution is the construction of a new seawater reverse osmosis plant.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project is currently being considered separately by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project covered in this report is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Australian High Commission in Abuja, Nigeria.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project proposes building a new compound, including a permanent purpose-built chancery, a new head of mission residence and supporting facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total cost of the proposed project is just over $38 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having an Australian high commission in Abuja enables Australia to showcase its physical presence in Nigeria and more widely in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         West Africa
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The new compound will have a higher level of security and amenity than the existing buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee was interested to hear about the modular method of construction that will be used.
       </p>
       <p>
        Buildings will be prefabricated here in Australia, shipped to Nigeria and then reassembled on site.
       </p>
       <p>
        This method provides greater value for money, ensures compliance with relevant building codes and supports Australian manufacturers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would like to extend its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of these inquiries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would particularly like to thank personnel from the Department of Defence and the department of infrastructure who made the committee's visit to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands possible—we did not go to Abuja.
       </p>
       <p>
        Viewing this unique and challenging location greatly helped the committee to assess the proposed works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly the committee would like to thank the Minister for Regional Development,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        and Territories and her staff for facilitating and sharing the committee's travel to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        For both projects, the committee recommends that it is expedient that the proposed works be carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the report to the House.

        <p>
         I'd like to make a brief contribution as the deputy chair. I'd like to thank the secretariat and the travelling delegation and acknowledge the work of the chair and the minister in what are some very remote locations in Australia. At Cocos, in particular, it's absolutely critical that a separate water source is provided. The three lenses that currently exist, two of which are contaminated, are essential—necessary not only for life on the island but for the upgrade, for the additional population that will find its way there and for this very substantial and significant investment in what is a remote territory for this country. The runway is obviously a key defence asset, and it is the only access apart from ship for the people who live on Cocos. In a rather unique turn, there is a golf course that gets suspended every time a plane lands, because it runs along the strip.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was so very pleased to see at both Cocos and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         the Australian flag flying proudly at the local official residences. I say to the individuals at Cocos and Christmas: you are part of Australia and you are part of our country. Our eyes are on you, and we are looking to provide support. As a separate aside, even I didn't know how big a contingent was based at Cocos in World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         . For example, there was an entire Spitfire squadron there, with many, many people working there.
        </p>
        <p>
         Christmas Island itself is unique. As we saw, there are more patches than pipe in the local water supply, and that is a critical investment which we discussed and looked at. I do want to acknowledge those who are working at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI" rel="nofollow">
          CI
         </a>
         mine, the phosphate mine. It does deliver the majority of the economy. They are clearly very large users of not only the water supply, other resources and the ports and roads; they do provide a substantial number of jobs. I'd very strongly recommend to those who are looking at the expansion that they consider that favourably. There are just under 3,000 tourists who go to Christmas Island, who of course utilise that infrastructure as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         In that part of the world, they are the front line of Australia, and I do want to acknowledge the people who live in those remote and far-flung territories for the work that they do. Thanks to the minister for her support and, of course, to the delegation once again.
        </p>
