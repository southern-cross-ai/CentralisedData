       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I wish to raise with you a matter of privilege, of which I notified you earlier. On 27 May 2010, the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        reported that the member for Ryan made a complaint to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        about a ‘senior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        official’s improper attempts and undue influence to pressure and intimidate’ him to resign from parliament. I table the article, entitled ‘Expelled Lib faces tax office grilling’. Comments attributed to the member for Ryan later identified this senior official to be LNP president Bruce McIver. I table the article from the
        <i>
         Courier-Mail
        </i>
        of 29 May entitled ‘Libs told to rein in bullies’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intimidation of a member may constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege and contempt against the House, as outlined in chapter 19 of
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        at page 731. It may also contravene the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which at section 4 provides that conduct may constitute an offence against the House if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … it amounts, or is intended … to amount, to an improper interference … with the free performance by a member of the member’s duties as a member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Attempting to intimidate an individual into resigning from parliament or refraining from nominating as a candidate for election could also constitute a criminal offence under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Electoral Act
        </a>
        1918. Section 327(1) provides:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A person shall not hinder or interfere with the free exercise or performance, by any other person, of any political right … that is relevant to an election …
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, the comments that have been attributed to the member for Ryan allege that the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        attempted to criminally intimidate him into resigning from the House of Representatives. If true, this may constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege, a contempt against the House and an offence under the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It may also constitute a criminal offence under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        These matters would seem relevant to the jurisdiction of the Privileges Committee and may constitute reasonable grounds for a referral. Mr Speaker, I ask that you consider the matters I have raised with a view to allowing precedence to a motion on these matters and indicate to you that, as a matter of courtesy, I had a discussion with the member for Ryan earlier today to confirm these matters.
