        Super Swim. I hooked up and thought it was a great idea, although I must say my efforts were not as great as others'. The Western District Health Service got behind it, formed a team and were able to raise over $2,000 for a wonderful, wonderful cause. Julia Howes led all fundraising efforts with a great effort. She raised over $1,000 herself, so congratulations to her. To the entire team and to everyone across the nation who helped the Starlight Children's Foundation raise money through the Super Swim: well done. It is a wonderful, wonderful cause to help and support sick children. They do a wonderful job, and right across the nation people were swimming to make sure they raised money for this great cause. I say to everyone who gets up, whether it be in the morning or at night, to go swimming: keep it up.
