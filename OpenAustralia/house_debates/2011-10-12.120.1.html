       <p>
        by leave—It gives me great pleasure as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac to announce today the members of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board. As the House would recall, I announced Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston as the Chair of the Board in July. From 2014 to 2018, Australia will commemorate the Anzac Centenary. During this time—and Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I know this is an issue that is close to your heart—we will remember and honour 100 years of service and sacrifice. The Anzac Centenary will mark one of the most important anniversaries in our nation's history. In March this year, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Commission
        </a>
        on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary presented its report to the Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The advisory board will provide high-level strategic advice to government on a program of commemorative activities in the years leading into the commemorative period and throughout the Anzac Centenary program from 2014 to 2018. The Anzac Centenary commemorative program will encompass all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australians have been involved.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The board will develop a program of commemorative activities in the years leading into the commemorative period and throughout the Anzac Centenary program from 2014 to 2018. It will engage with the community and other sectors to canvass a wide range of views in formulating its advice to government. The board will also build on the earlier work undertaken by the national commission and the public submission process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted to announce today that 16 highly capable and professional Australians, along with four ex-officio members, have been selected to join Air Chief Marshal Houston on the board. The appointments are: Mrs Kathryn Greiner, Mr James Strong, Professor Christine Charles, Mr Sandy Hollway, Professor Margaret Gardiner, Mr Peter FitzSimons, Ms Liz Ellis, His Honour Judge Rauf Soulio, Dr Jackie Huggins, Professor David Horner, Mr Luke Bowen, Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas, Major-General Brian Howard, Brigadier Bill Rolfe, the Hon.

        ; Rear Admiral Ken Doolan, National President of the Returned and Services League of Australia; and His Excellency Major-General Martyn Dunne,

        </a>
        to Australia. I table a list of the members together with a brief description of their current or previous roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding the right mix of people has been an important consideration. The board members I have announced today have a great deal of experience in their relevant fields and will bring an outstanding diversity of views to the Centenary of Anzac preparations. Of particular note, our longstanding and special Anzac relationship with New Zealand is represented on the board by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand High Commissioner
        </a>
        to Australia, His Excellency Major-General Martyn Dunne, one of four ex-officio members.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that the centenary creates an enduring legacy to educate future generations about the Anzac legend and how our nation's involvement in military operations has shaped us not only in terms of the service and sacrifice of those who have so proudly worn the nation's uniform but also in what it meant for those at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board will be supported by six advisory groups which will focus on the areas of:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Ex-service organisations will also have the opportunity to actively contribute to the development of the Anzac Centenary program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The is a truly bipartisan activity and I welcome the commitment from the coalition to the process. The advisory board's inaugural meeting will occur later this week, and I look forward to working with the board on this very significant occasion in Australia's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for a period of 5½ minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Robert speaking for a period not exceeding 5½ minutes.

         The coalition welcomes the long overdue appointment of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board. Earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition joined the shadow minister with responsibility in this area, Senator the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ronaldson" rel="nofollow">

         . It is a little disappointing that it has taken the Minister for Veterans' Affairs more than three months to announce Air Chief Marshal Houston's 20 fellow board members, including the four ex-officio members: notably, the Secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The remaining 16 members of the board represent a broad cross-section of the Australian business and intellectual community. Of the 20 board members, not including Air Chief Marshal Houston, there are five members with experience in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         or who are representatives of ex-service organisations. Some, may suggest that the board is too large and potentially unwieldy, but time will determine whether this criticism is fair.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition is disappointed, however, that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>

          The Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         , the ceremonial and indeed spiritual home of commemoration in this nation, will play a significant role in the centenary commemorations and their exclusion is regrettable. The Australian community will expect that the nation's home of commemoration will be fully included in all plans to commemorate the Centenary of ANZAC. After all, it was on the battlefields of Gallipoli where
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bean" rel="nofollow">
          Charles Bean
         </a>
         began to dream of what would become that great institution, the Australian War Memorial.
        </p>
        <p>
         In February this year, the Prime Minister and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC accepted a report from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          National Commission
         </a>
         for the Commemoration of the Centenary of the ANZAC Landing, an initiative of former, perhaps soon to be again, Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd MP. The commission comprised    former prime ministers
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Hawke
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Fraser" rel="nofollow">

         ; the President of the

          Warren Brown
         </a>
         ; recently-retired Major Matina Jewell; and war widow Kylie Russell. The commission received more than 1,000 ideas for consideration from more than 600 individual submissions. The commission's report was presented to government in February but, sadly, it has been collecting dust in someone's office ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been no action on any recommendations, save for the six-month period taken to appoint the ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board to advance the planning of the project. To date, no budget has been set or funding guidelines determined for the centenary, a matter which concerns the veteran and ex-service community. The minister's earlier statement that funding would be determined in the third quarter of this year has come and gone without a result.
        </p>
        <p>
         Without funding, Minister Snowdon, important projects with time critical deadlines may be jeopardised. The first such project which instantly comes to mind is the proposed ANZAC Interpretive Centre in Albany. Despite the minister travelling to Albany in late July apparently to buy himself and the government a headline with a $250,000 grant for a scoping study for the centre, no money has actually been delivered to the organisations which will be responsible for the scoping study and the preparation of a more substantial funding brief to government. Minister, time is ticking for this project. Albany, as all honourable members of the House will only be too aware, was the point of departure for Australian and New Zealand troops heading to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         pending their deployment to Gallipoli. Albany is also the home of the first
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC_Day" rel="nofollow">
          ANZAC Day
         </a>
         dawn service, conducted by Padre White on the slopes of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Clarence" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Clarence
         </a>
         in 1916.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proposed ANZAC Interpretive Centre and wider enhancement works of the Albany commemorative precinct are time critical.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
          The City
         </a>
         of Albany Council has indicated that, without the government's $250,000 funding being delivered by the end of this month, 18 days time, scoping works to enable the delivery of the project by the end of the 2014 centenary may be jeopardised. On the other side of the country in Melbourne, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine_of_Remembrance" rel="nofollow">
          Shrine of Remembrance
         </a>
         requires a major redevelopment and safety enhancement works. These works will cost millions and advice is needed by the end of the year about any federal funding support for this work. I know the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, in his extensive travels around Australia, has been regularly briefed by veterans in small communities about the need for funding certainty to enable community based commemoration to be at the forefront of the centenary commemorations between 2014 and 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition welcomes the appointment of the ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board. We wish them the best in their deliberations to deliver an appropriate commemorative agenda to remember the service and sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have served in the Australian Defence Force. I thank the minister for the opportunity to make some comments.
