       <p>
        Today I recognise Tangney's Local Sporting Champions. While the grant they receive of $500 does not go too far for young people in Tangney, who have to travel great distances to represent their state or their country, it is still very welcome relief for supportive parents who are passionate about young sportspeople.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the latest round of Local Sporting Champions recipients in Tangney, I was happy to see some less popular sports being played. Phoebe Wardell-Johnson is competing nationally in calisthenics and Lilli McAuliffe is competing in women's championship cricket. Lauren Hardbottle recently went over to Townsville to represent WA with the Black Ducks, WA's junior wheelchair basketball team, at the Kevin Coombs Cup. Lauren trains twice a week with her teammates in Mirrabooka and Melville. Maybe one day, with upgrades to the Willetton Basketball Stadium, it might become a new home for Lauren and her team. Carla Drennan represented WA in junior basketball, Timothy Harvey represented WA in cycling, Douw Hoogenboezen represented WA in cricket and Gregory Chan did exceptionally well representing WA in squash at the Australian junior championship.
       </p>
       <p>
        We celebrated their achievements and the achievements of all Tangney Local Sporting Champions at an afternoon tea I held in my electorate office. They are the next generation of world champions who train hard and apply their effort. I want to make sure we do everything we can to make their dreams of representing Australia in competitive sport come true. Well done.
