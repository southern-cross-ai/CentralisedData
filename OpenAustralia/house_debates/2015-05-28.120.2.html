       <p>
        As I was saying earlier, I was really pleased to attend so many of the services that were held in my community of Robertson on Anzac Day itself, beginning, of course, with the incredible dawn service organised by the Terrigal Wamberal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-Branch, which was held on Terrigal Beach itself. Thousands of people were out at dawn, and one of the most memorable and moving parts of this service—in addition to the schoolchildren who laid wreaths, and to the many representatives and returned servicemen and women who laid wreaths—was the sight of 12 surf-lifesaving boats coming to shore, representing and re-enacting the landing at Gallipoli. It was an incredibly moving moment. Of course, there were many other dawn services held around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        that day, including by the Davistown RSL, by the Gosford RSL and at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There were special commemorations all around the community, including at the Tarragal Glen Retirement Village in Erina, organised by Eric Flood; at Ettalong, a moving morning service organised by the Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia on the Central Coast; at Pine Needles retirement village at Erina, and I thank Alan Redding for that; at Woy Woy, a morning service organised by the Woy Woy Ettalong-Hardy's Bay RSL Sub-Branch. There were other services as well, including in Gosford,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardys_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Hardys Bay
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Pearl Beach
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most special aspects of Anzac Day in my community is the service that is held at Macmasters Beach at five o'clock as the sun goes down right on the beach there. It reminds you very much of Gallipoli. It is an incredibly moving service, and it is always a memorable occasion. Even if we were seeing thunder and lightning go off as
        <i>
         The Ode
        </i>
        was read and some other things were happening, it was a very special moment. I do thank Vince Roberts and the organising committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there are so many young people who also commemorate Anzac Day, and they want to know more about our history and the legacy of the men and women who have served our country. Time only permits me to mention two such services. One was at Holy Cross Catholic School in Kincumber, where they not only had a very moving service, but they also secured an Anzac Centenary local grant to construct a plinth monument and a memorial garden. I do want to say thank you to the principal, Gerard McGilvray, and to the teacher, Kelvin Maxwell, who helped organise this. The other, of course, was at Chertsey Primary School in Springfield, with another Anzac Centenary local grant. They had a local sculptor and parent, Michael Vaynman, create a beautiful sculpture of poppies and a slouch hat, in the garden at the entrance to the school. It really is a spectacular and memorable sculpture. I thank the principal, Toni Skinner, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Dore" rel="nofollow">
         Ann Dore
        </a>
        as well. Finally, I also acknowledge the work of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rae" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Rae
        </a>
        and the Central Coast Marine Discovery Centre, who received a grant to construct a travelling education

        I exhibition.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I thank the members of the Robertson Electorate Anzac Day Grants Committee, who served us tirelessly and well, including Mal Brian, Greg Mawson, Patsy Edwards,

I also acknowledge the life of Mick Waddell, a former president of Terrigal Wamberal RSL Sub-Branch, who, sadly, passed away in December of last year. He gave tirelessly and willingly of his time and his friendship to all who knew him, and he is greatly missed. May he rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        These Anzac Day commemorations around our community demonstrate that, together in the electorate of Robertson, we will ensure that the legacy of those who served—and of the men and women who continue to serve our country in Australia and, indeed, right around the world—will not be forgotten. Lest we forget.

        <p>
         Every year, early on cold mornings we silently express the words, 'Lest we forget' yet 25 April is always a powerful day of remembrance. We remember on that day, 1915 Australia, with a modest population of five million. Out of that five million, one million were men. Out of that one million, 420,000 enlisted for service, 330,000 left our shores and only 270,000 returned, and of those over 150,000 had been physically wounded—an exacting toll on a young nation. In the parts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         that I represent, it had an even greater toll, given the size of the population in our part of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Time is always taken to pay homage to those 60,000 Australians—who fought in the Gallipoli campaign and who fought valiantly alongside our dear friends from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         —and the 9,000 who died, the 20,000 who were wounded, and the countless others who were forced to carry the dark memory of that day from that point on. It was that toll and, importantly, that sacrifice and service that continually draws out more and more people to attend Anzac dawn services.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year it was a privilege for me, as it was for all of us in this House, to attend our respective dawn services. But it was particularly a moving event for me. At
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooty_Hill" rel="nofollow">
          Rooty Hill
         </a>
         the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         had brought together people for the dawn service; it had moved the dawn service from Pinegrove at Minchinbury to the actual RSL itself
        </p>
        <p>
         They had estimated 5,000 would attend; in the end, 10,000 attended. It was the single greatest gathering of locals that I have seen—and I grew up in the area. People of all ages, from the very young to the very old, were all there to pay their respects; they may have been families of veterans, but there were many who were not. We were Australians one and all, and there for a singular purpose: to remember the toll exacted on a young nation but also to pay deep respect to the values embodied by those who have served through the years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wreaths were laid at the foot of a new war memorial at Rooty Hill RSL as decorated war veterans paid their respects. The service ended with the official opening of the club's new war memorial and cenotaph—a fitting and tasteful memorial that will serve the area very well. The memorial echoes and reflects the community's respect for the Anzac tradition. The success of the opening demonstrated how deeply the community cares that our service men and women are properly respected, and honoured the contributions of all those who have served through Australia's various military campaigns. It will be a permanent reminder of those who fought in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War" rel="nofollow">
          World War
         </a>
         I and other conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The monument traces the history of the club too, and hails the veterans who had the vision to organise the RSL as their second home in the then rural Rooty Hill. Last year Rooty Hill RSL actually celebrated 50 years of existence; there were 124 people, mainly veterans, who joined together to form the club. I want to acknowledge the great work of the sub-branch, the RSL itself, headed by chairman Ray Johns, and its management team, headed by Richard Errington. I have deep regard for the management, the sub-branch and all the members who have made this one of the great RSLs of this country. The fact that they had worked so tirelessly with so many people to put together such an incredibly moving and special event is a great credit to all of them. Our community expresses a deep gratitude for the way in which they conducted that event.
        </p>

         In the week leading into Anzac Day we also had the opportunity to recognise a number of organisations that have got together to leverage off the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. A number of members have reflected on the success of the program in the local area. In Chifley, there was a $26,000 grant for the Anzac Centenary Walk in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Druitt" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Druitt
         </a>
         Park's remembrance garden. It was established as a result of some hard work by the Mount Druitt Historical Society, Colyton
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_School" rel="nofollow">
          Public School
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Blacktown City Council
         </a>
         . Colyton Public School is over 100 years old and a historical landmark in our area; it also provides quality education today. The new principal, Greg O'Neill, was present at the event that unveiled the actual walk. Blacktown City Council championed the grant and brought everyone together. The Anzac Centenary Walk features five monuments with the stories of local soldiers who fought in Gallipoli back in 1915. Each monument complements the existing World War 1 roll of honour monument that lists the names of Mount Druitt diggers from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
          World War I
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         One of those soldiers was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weir" rel="nofollow">
          James Weir
         </a>
         , who had not been entirely up-front about his age—enlisting at the age of 11! Three years later, aged 14, he sailed to join the war effort. It was fabled that young James kept falling over when he tried to fire a rifle and was made a bugler in response to this. He survived World War I and, in 1942, his family migrated to Australia as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Pound_Poms" rel="nofollow">
          Ten Pound Poms
         </a>
         and started a new life in Mount Druitt. His youngest son, Philip, is a Mount Druitt Historical Society patron. Another local remembered was Owen Wallace Baker.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baker" rel="nofollow">
          The Baker
         </a>
         family lived on Chatsworth Road in Rooty Hill. Owen enlisted in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIF" rel="nofollow">
          AIF
         </a>
         on 8 March 1916. He eventually became a stretcher bearer, but fought alongside the diggers for a strenuous eight months. In July 1917, he was unfortunately killed in action by shellfire. Soldiers like Stephen Shadlow are also commemorated. Shadlow, a former bricklayer, landed in Gallipoli on the first night, 25 April, after serving in previous expeditions. On 29 April, during heavy shelling along the Anzac front line, he was killed by shellfire. His cousin's daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Shadlow, spoke on behalf of the family when the Anzac Centenary Walk was dedicated. She expressed the family's appreciation of the recognition given to him. She said, 'Shadlow has been a long-respected name in the area, and I am proud and honoured he hasn't been forgotten.' His sacrifice is remembered in both the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Lone Pine Memorial
         </a>
         and Colyton Public School's roll of honour. Another infamous Mount Druitt local I have spoken about previously in this place, John Barney Hines—who had developed a fearsome reputation—was also recognised on the day. He had been recognised for his courage and valour. But he passed away, on his own, in a humpy in Mount Druitt. He was eventually recognised last year by Governor Marie Bashir. His grave had been unmarked, but a tombstone was placed there in November last year in a very moving service.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were many other service men and women who served in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWI" rel="nofollow">
          WWI
         </a>
         from other parts of Chifley. Almost 900 men and women from Blacktown volunteered to participate in World War I, and 136 of them were killed in action or died of wounds, disease or accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I want to recognise the contribution of our nation's first people in World War I. There were so many from our area who served. Despite Army rules designed to prevent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Aboriginal Australians
         </a>
         from enlisting, many fought for a country that they loved. But they were given very little honour on return. Despite the barrier, a large number of Aboriginal Australians enlisted. The original estimated number of 400 has risen to more than 1,000. It is important to recognise their contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
         All in all, this war took a devastating toll on our nation. We rightly pause to remember. A few years after these terrible events,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Monash" rel="nofollow">
          Sir John Monash
         </a>
         wondered aloud whether we would remember. I believe Monash would be proud of a nation that has never forgotten. We will always remember them.
