       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate the Reynella Neighbourhood Centre on its 21st birthday. I was delighted last Sunday to be celebrating with the volunteers, community members and staff of this important centre in our local community. The centre has been providing the local community a place to gather for over 50 years; however, 21 years ago the centre was expanded and developed into the centre we know today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre’s mission statement says it is a place for people to meet, value and respect each other’s contributions, recognise strengths and differences in individuals and provide opportunities for lifelong learning, growth and fun. And when I attended the centre last Sunday this was certainly on display.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre provides a range of activities for young people through to seniors. I got to talk to people from the writers club, and their diverse talents and experience was certainly on show. Ms Jan Peck, the secretary, told me that the neighbourhood centre is all about bringing people in the community together. This neighbourhood centre would not be able to run without its volunteers, and I would like to congratulate all the volunteers and the staff for this very important centre that really does bring our community together in the southern suburbs of Adelaide.
