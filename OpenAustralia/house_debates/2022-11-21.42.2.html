       <p>
        The rural town of Rosewood is in mourning following the death of community champion Arnold George Rieck. He died on Friday 11 November, just after his 90th birthday. Social media and other forms of Ipswich local media have been full of praise for and recollections about Arnold and his life. My sincere condolences to wife, Joyce, his family and his many friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        The service of Thanksgiving was held last Friday at Rosewood Uniting Church, where Arnold worshipped. Mourners spilled out of the church onto the lawns, and I was one of them. It seemed that most of Rosewood was there. Police officers, politicians, community leaders, media personalitiesâ€”everyone seemed to be there, paying their respects and honouring Arnold.

        He was a beloved teacher of 38 years and Scout leader, environmentalist and cricket enthusiast. He was a thoroughly decent and honourable individual. A self-proclaimed Brisbane import, he came to Rosewood in 1958. He shaped that country town. He ensured that local native plant species were not lost. He created the Rosewood scrub arboretum, a museum of living trees, 150 species, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He led the special restoration of Masons Gully, where there is now a walkway proudly named Arnold Rieck Walk. A doyen of West Moreton Landcare, he was a mentor to many and an example to all. He organised local schoolchildren and local volunteers to beautify Rosewood. Vale Arnold. Well done, community champion.
