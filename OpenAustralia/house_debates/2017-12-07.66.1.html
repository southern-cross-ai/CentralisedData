        On 29 November I had the pleasure of visiting the Waggrakine Volunteer Bushfire Brigade cadet unit on their training night and watching them in action. I was proud to sponsor the Waggrakine cadet unit on their recent attendance at the Australian Fire Cadet Championships. Lauren, Cory, Jai, Ewan, Max and their captain, Sheridan, travelled from Geraldton in the mid-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        to Sydney and then up to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myuna_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to compete, travelling further than any other team in Australia. They took home the Dave Templeman award for their effort, which recognises a team who have demonstrated through action and attitude the qualities which best represent the championships. To that fabulous team, I say: you should be immensely proud of this achievement.

        Volunteer firefighters are an integral and largely underappreciated facet of life outside of the inner city. I was thrilled to see these young boys and girls, some as young as 12, carrying out the drills and learning the skills that could potentially save lives and property. I would like to conclude by thanking Darren and Lisa Cole and Jack Milby, who went across with the cadets, and Mark Teale, who, as captain of the Waggrakine brigade, assists with their training. Without your help, Mark, none of this would be possible.
       </p>

        While I'm on my feet, I would like to wish everyone in Durack a very merry Christmas and a very safe and prosperous new year. Hopefully they all get home safe off the roads.
