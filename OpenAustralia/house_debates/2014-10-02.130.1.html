        Australia has a population around 23 million, but do you realise that about four million people in this country are reported as having a disability? This is not something that is prevalent in various parts of our communities; it is pretty well distributed. To put it in perspective, as I understand it every 30 minutes someone is diagnosed with a significant disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member representing an electorate that, for various reasons, has a high proportion of families living with disability, and being a grandfather of a grandson who is on the autism spectrum, I certainly understand the challenges and difficulties that families and carers face, and also the amount of work that families need to contribute to looking after an individual with a disability, particularly at a personal level.
       </p>
       <p>
        As parents we all want the best for our children and as grandparents we want the same. We certainly do not love our children with disabilities any less. As a matter of fact, in Nathaniel's case it is probably the reverse. We do aspire to ensure that there is proper inclusion in our community. That is why I was very inspired by the International Naturally Autistic People Awards Convention and Festival, which is an absolutely fantastic initiative. This convention focuses on uniting the autistic community around the world, and it provides autistic individuals with the opportunity to showcase their various talents and skills. This convention is hosted by the

        I was first made aware of this convention through a very good friend of mine, young Ana Nguyen in my electorate. I have known her over the last four years. She is a person who has a disability. She has autism. Ana has a passion, though. She very much has a passion for singing and songwriting. She is a very strong and forthright young woman, a woman who understands her disability and one who is committed to making a difference in the community. I congratulate Ana, and I congratulate the International Naturally Autistic People Awards Convention and Festival, which is currently being held in Edinburgh, Scotland. I wish well to all the participants. Truly these organisations make it better for our community, a community which loves all individuals, particularly those with disabilities.
