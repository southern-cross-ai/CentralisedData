        If you throw your mind back to last year on 23 November, we had a BARBECURE event in the Senate quadrangle. It was a bit of a wet and miserable day, but it was a day where their staff convinced me to hold a BARBECURE in my electorate of Swan. On the Friday evening of the last sitting week, I and the state member for Belmont, Glenys Godfrey, held a BARBECURE event in Swan. BARBECURE is a fantastic fundraising initiative of Cure Cancer Australia that aims to raise awareness and vital funds to help find a cure for cancer. For 50 years, Cure Cancer Australia has been leading the way in funding cancer research and to date has funded over 483 research grants to more than 316 individual researchers.

        This year alone, 120,700 people will be diagnosed with cancer in Australia. More than 820 people lose their battle with cancer each week here in Australia. That is 117 people dying each and every day in Australia. These are devastating statistics which have seen many families and individuals in our communities greatly affected by cancer. That is why I teamed up with Glenys to host our own BARBECURE event to do our part for such an important cause. It was great to have so many of our constituents coming down and enjoying a wonderful evening on the river foreshore of

        in Ascot. I would like to thank everyone who did come along for their support. I am proud to advise the House that our BARBECURE raised over $500, all of which has gone to Cure Cancer Australia. Cure Cancer Australia, keep up the great work that you are doing.
