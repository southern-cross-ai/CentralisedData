       <p>
        The National School Chaplaincy Program has supported the wellbeing of students and school communities since its establishment in 2006. The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year. The National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in a variety of ways, adapting delivery for both the student and the school environment. Each school has bespoke arrangements, often determined by need, location and the sociodemographic make-up of the community. Types of offerings are far reaching and can include individual student support, breakfast clubs, simply checking with students during lunch breaks or even joining a game of soccer. There is indirect support as well, with services for the broader school community, teachers, support admin staff, parents, carers and families.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent review of the program found that chaplains simply being present is critical because they can create a more safe and supportive school environment; identify and respond to wellbeing issues early—for example, identifying behavioural or social issues and helping students with strategies to overcome them—empower students by providing them with encouragement, advice and strategies; build relationships with students; provide a stable and consistent adult figure or role model; and be available for students by acting as an approachable go-to person that is viewed as separate from other staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students have faced significant pressures over recent years, from natural disasters to the COVID pandemic and extended state lockdowns. We're seeing a decline in student participation in sporting activities and community events, exacerbating social isolation and loneliness. There was a report yesterday that found that—as reported on 3AW, which drew my attention to it—loneliness is a factor across our society, but the report found it was most prevalent in 14- to 24-year-olds. They had the biggest problem with loneliness, and it talks about that isolation. The number of young people experiencing mental health challenges has also risen over recent years, from one in five children to one in four. The current cost-of-living pressures being faced by families across the country only exacerbate that pressure and highlight the need for more of these trusted services like the National School Chaplaincy Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key measures in the budget for students is the student wellbeing boost, a Labor election commitment. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised that this would fund school counsellors and psychologists, with extra funding for camps and excursions, as well as sporting and social activities, that improve children's wellbeing. The total commitment of the package was $203.7 million over two years, and this included $10.8 million to develop a mental health check tool. This left $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support services to students. The department advised that there are around 4,046,000 primary and secondary students in Australia. If you deduct that $10.8 million, which is going to be used to develop a mental health check tool, this leaves around $47.67 per student. What sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 10,000 public submissions were made to the government. A high proportion of respondents—25 per cent—were parents and guardians, 14 per cent were other members of the public and 14 per cent were teachers. More than 43 per cent of respondents to the survey were based in Queensland, and 74 per cent of those were not school based stakeholders. The evaluation found that the National School Chaplaincy Program allowed a holistic approach to wellbeing, meaning chaplains could work alongside students and others to identify and respond to different wellbeing needs. This means chaplains can identify and respond to all wellbeing needs—mental, physical, social, spiritual, intellectual and economic. It's a great program.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had a chaplain at school. I went to a church based school. Our chaplain was a popular member of the staff contingent, and I remember with fondness his ability to move easily amongst the students.
       </p>
       <p>
        This program has been an excellent program, and I expect the government will continue on in support of students at this time when they've never ever needed this program more than they do today.

          <p>
           I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Forde, and following the member for Monash, and I commend the member for Forde for this motion because, at the heart of this motion is something that I think everyone in this place agrees on—a matter of paramount importance, and that is: the wellbeing of Australian schoolchildren. We know that students who are happy and supported have a greatly enhanced capacity to learn and thrive, and it sets them up for the rest of their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           We also know, thanks to the Productivity Commission's recent report, that one in five young people from 11 to 17 years of age experience a high level of psychological distress. This reality should be unacceptable to us all. But this is not confined to a single demographic. It affects youth across Australia, and particularly those in out-of-home care, those with disabilities and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           students. The upheaval brought about by COVID-19 and recent natural disasters has also exacerbated these conditions, and it has been a particularly tough time for young people in Australia over the past few years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Student attendance, as a gauge of student engagement, reflects the state of wellbeing in our educational system, and, sadly, falls in attendance have been seen in all sectors—primary and secondary, urban and rural, government and non-government schools. In 2015, nearly 78 per cent of students attended school on nine of 10 days, but, by 2019, this had dipped to 73 per cent. Following the pandemic in 2022, that rate has plummeted further to a mere 49.9 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
           To address this crisis, the government is embarking on a transformative journey, the National Student Wellbeing Program. It's not a mere change in name; it's a promise to our students and their guardians that we are committed to their welfare. This program will empower schools to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. Sixty-one million dollars has been funded annually over five years, and schools can access funding of up to $20,280, with additional support for remote areas available. These officers and chaplains will provide much-needed support for students and their families. This will include pastoral care; essential services, like breakfast clubs; excursions; and workshops for parents. Their presence will help bridge the gap not only in the education system but in the broader lives of these young Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our commitment is not solely financial, though; it is backed by passionate voices across the educational spectrum. Sally Egan, formerly of the National Catholic Education Commission, underscores the importance of these funds, saying that 'these much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff,' and that 'addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning'. Margery Evans of Independent Schools Australia has said that the measures in the budget for the wellbeing of students show that the government understands the importance of these issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           This initiative builds on a strong foundation. An independent review of the former National School Chaplaincy Program highlighted its significant role in supporting student welfare. The review recommended expanding qualifications to include mental health competencies. Consequently, the renamed program, the National Student Wellbeing Program, takes a more inclusive stance and allows schools and parents the choice to engage a secular student welfare officer as an alternative to a chaplain.
          </p>
          <p>
           But our support doesn't stop there. The Student Wellbeing Boost is an integral part of our commitment. This is a $500 million investment aimed at helping students overcome the pandemic's mental health impacts. The Assistant Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
            Mental Health
           </a>
           and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, notes:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           It's been a tough two years for students and the Albanese Government has a plan to help them bounce back from the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
           That's so important. This boost includes a voluntary mental-health-check tool, providing schools with the means to identify and assist students in need. Additionally, $192 million will be distributed to schools for mental health and wellbeing support. This can encompass hiring more psychologists and counsellors, organising activities to enhance wellbeing and implementing proven mental health initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our goal is clear: to create a better and fairer education system that caters to both academic achievement and emotional wellbeing. We envision a future where every student has the opportunity to succeed and where their wellbeing is at the heart of their educational pursuits. It is our responsibility to ensure that our schools are nurturing environments and places where our students can flourish academically and emotionally. That's exactly what we're trying to do.

            I rise in support of the member for Forde's motion and I thank him for bringing it to the attention of the chamber. I recently heard from Jack from Mooloolaba, who talked about his chaplain, Chappy Stu. Jack is a family violence survivor who entered high school with a whole array of struggles. Chappy Stu took Jack under his wing, paid for leadership training, spent lunchtimes with him and looked after him. Jack went on to graduate high school with a scholarship to study law and returned to his high school to help kids just like him. He credits his chaplain for pulling him out of a downward spiral to nowhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our chaplains don't just transform lives; they often save lives.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
             The University
            </a>
            of Western Australia's national school chaplaincy evaluation showed that 87 per cent of schoolteachers, student services and executives found that chaplains made their students feel loved and safe; 81 per cent identified that chaplains enhanced students' school participation; and a majority found they positively added to learning, health promotion, filling basic material needs and cultivating a positive sense of culture and identity. These are fantastic outcomes, which show that the chaplaincy program is working. Any good government would get behind a program with this kind of support and with these kinds of outcomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today I call on the Albanese government to continue investing in the National School Chaplaincy Program in the long term. I call on them to restore the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGR" rel="nofollow">
             DGR
            </a>
            status to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripture_Union" rel="nofollow">
             Scripture Union
            </a>
            and all other charitable organisations providing chaplaincy services to schools, institutions and local communities. If the government were fair dinkum about the welfare of young people and the importance of chaplaincy to young people, why on earth would they have removed the DGR status from Chaplaincy Queensland? It beggars belief.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scripture Union, Queensland's largest school based chaplaincy provider, estimates that chaplains have as many as 26,000 pastoral care conversations every week with students, their families and their teachers. An average chaplain working three days a week will have a weekly load of 23 students in need of pastoral care. I've heard stories of chaplains working 12-hour days just to fit all their work in. They're running breakfast programs before the sun rises and hosting community events long after the sun sets. School chappies show compassion and devotion to making our community safer, better engaged and more inclusive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to conclude by paying tribute to those school chappies in my electorate who go above and beyond. I want to say a very big thank you, from me and from your school communities, to Shane Brigg; Michelle Winser; Scott Carroll;

            I have been to many chaplaincy fundraising events. The realisation of the concept of chaplaincy, of looking after the welfare of young people in schools, wouldn't have happened but for the decision of

            all those years ago. We continued that funding over the nine years of the latest iteration of a coalition government. We are committed to looking after the welfare of young people. I am really concerned that the government would make this into a political statement by removing the DGR status of some of these organisations. What does the government have against these religious bodies? I do not know. I call upon them to return that DGR status today.

             The National Student Wellbeing Program supports over 3,000 public schools right across Australia. One of the great improvements made by the Albanese government was to enable all state schools to have choice. Communities have the choice of either a chaplain or a qualified student wellbeing officer. This flexibility is really important for schools, as it allows them to cater for their specific needs and what suits their community. It's also important for those schools situated in lower-socioeconomic communities to have choice. Many of these schools don't have the luxury of a well-funded and well-resourced church group to help pay the wages of a chaplain. The more stretched a community is, the more chance they're unable to fund a chaplain, and—let's be honest—the kids in that school probably have more challenges. So the option to employ a qualified wellbeing officer is important for such communities. Also, not all parents or communities are comfortable for their children to speak to someone who may not hold the same faith or non-faith beliefs. The ABS tells us that less than eight per cent of Australians regularly attend religious services nowadays.
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Student Wellbeing Program's officers and chaplains work in collaboration with school communities to support the wellbeing of school students through providing pastoral care, organising volunteer activities with the school community, running programs such as breakfast clubs and lunchtime activities, and coordinating school excursions and parent carer workshops. In their role working with school communities, the

             student wellbeing officers and chaplains do not provide religious instruction or religious counselling—an important reminder. They may be of any faith or of no faith. They must not proselytise in a state school; they must respect, accept and be sensitive to other views, values and beliefs; and they must promote a safe and inclusive school community. We are talking about children here. They must comply with state and territory laws and policies in relation to child protection matters, and they must have relevant and valid state and territory working with children or vulnerable people checks. They must meet the qualification requirements of the NSWP and must undertake the cyberbullying professional learning package delivered by the eSafety Commission.

             The effects they have locally can be profound. We know that. In my electorate, at Wellers Hill State School, Robyn Maxwell, besides providing pastoral care to students, parents and staff, also coordinates the Modelling Affirmation, Trust, Encouragement and Support group. At Salisbury State School, Angeline Pang works with the school student support team, including the guidance officer and welfare officer, to provide a safe place for students to talk about their struggles, such as family problems, confusing relationships, friendship issues, peer pressure, self-esteem issues, bullying, stress and anxiety. Thank you, Angeline. At

             I could go on with many other examples of schools across my electorate of Moreton, across Queensland and across Australia where they are delivering the National Student Wellbeing Program. We know that this can be an effective program with the right people. We know that the National Student Wellbeing Program can change lives and, dare I say, even save lives. But it must have the ability and flexibility to deliver for the needs of schools and their communities. As I said, if we let chaplains only operate in schools that have the resources to pay for the chaplain, the communities that are poorest and hardest up will actually miss out. That's why we made these important changes to the National Student Wellbeing Program.

              This has been a good debate. I think all in this chamber would agree that schools and education have changed since we were there. The member for Ryan; the member for Moreton, who has just left the chamber and just spoke; and the member for Tangney would agree with that. The member for Jagajaga has probably been at school in more recent years than we four have. Indeed, school has changed a lot. I was complimenting your youth there, Member for Jagajaga. I know what a worthwhile contribution you make to this place. Since its establishment in 2006 the National School Chaplaincy Program has supported the wellbeing of students and school communities. When I and others went to school these sorts of programs and people were perhaps not in place, because they did not need to be, but life has changed.

             <p>
              The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year, and this is a good motion put forward by the member for Forde. It is calling on the government to do more. And why would that be necessary? Well, you only have to look at the statistics out of recent reviews et cetera, which show that each term chaplains run 5,711 programs supporting almost a quarter of a million students.
             </p>
             <p>
              Particularly during COVID-19 we saw how tough it was for teachers—and we have many good teachers in this country—when their students weren't doing the face-to face learning. Chaplains undertook activities outside their normal duties as a result of the global pandemic, and the statistics speak for themselves. They provided care packages and food parcels—42 per cent of them were doing that. There was encouragement and morale boosting for school communities, with 46 per cent of them doing that. Just during COVID-19, the following percentages of chaplains noted somewhat more interaction online of 56 per cent; interaction via phone of 51 per cent; mental health issues of 68 per cent; family conflict issues of 57 per cent; school behaviour issues of 57 per cent; friendship and peer issues of 42 per cent; and bullying and harassment issues of 30 per cent. And they're addressing those challenges. The chaplains are very well-meaning people who have experience and expertise, and who are addressing those issues. But for the chaplains, that work may well not be done.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, I know that the total commitment to the package by this government is $203.7 million over two years. That includes a $10.8 million contribution to develop a mental health check tool, and that's important. That leaves $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support to students. The department advises that there are around 4,046,585 primary and secondary students across the nation. My concern is that if you take away the $10.8 million which is going to be used to develop the mental health check tool then it leaves only around $47.67 per student. We have to ask what sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?
             </p>
             <p>
              Mental health is such an important thing, it really is. As I said at the outset, schooling has changed. Contributions by teachers and, certainly, after-hours care have changed. In my day, often one parent went out and earned the income and the other parent, usually the mum, was at home when the kids got home. But, these days, many kids are latchkey kids. Again, that's why chaplains are important; they fill the gaps left by necessarily two-income families and they fill the gaps that are sometimes there because of family breakdown. There are all manner of reasons. But the National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in so many ways and in so many areas.
             </p>
             <p>
              Often, the problems which are seen in metropolitan areas are exacerbated in regional areas because of remoteness and the lack of available resources and personnel. Again, I commend the member for Forde for bringing this very important motion to parliament and I note the various items he has put towards it.

              <p>
               It is so important that we do all we can to support student wellbeing. We know that the pandemic and all that came with it made it hard for students, not only in how they engaged in their education but also in the many other life skills that young people get from being in a school environment. I know from travelling around my electorate at the moment, talking to students, teachers and principals, that they're still finding that they're dealing with some of the longer-term consequences of that period we spent in COVID.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I want to start by acknowledging all of the people in my community who I know spend so much time thinking about and working on helping to address student wellbeing. In particular is the work of teachers and principals in my community. The pandemic has changed the way many of them think about wellbeing, and there's plenty that's being done locally to set up new ways for students to receive wellbeing support and to feel like they have a safe place when they're at school and they're struggling—somewhere they can go for support. More broadly, in my community there are organisations which are doing great work to engage with young people. I'd like, particularly, to commend a local organisation, the Pat Cronin Foundation. It was formed by parents Matt and Robyn after their son Pat died from a coward punch—a punch in the back of the head. In the years since, Matt and Robyn have grown the foundation and they reach out to young people in schools, sporting clubs, youth groups and others to educate them about safety, respect and why violence is never the answer. I want to recognise them for the incredible work they do, and continue to do, for young people's and students' wellbeing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our government is funding a lot of work to support student wellbeing. I'll start by talking particularly about the Student Wellbeing Boost. This is a program that includes $10.8 million for a new voluntary mental health check tool to enable schools to ensure students get the support they need and $192 million in additional one-off funding to every school to support students' mental health and wellbeing. This is extra funding that principals can spend on supports such as extra psychologists and school counsellors, camps, excursions and activities that improve student wellbeing and wellbeing engagement in mental health initiatives. As I just said, it is so necessary at this time as all schools are continuing to think about how they can help students be back in the classroom and how they can help them with the socialisation that they missed out on during the period when we were in lockdown. I visited one secondary school in my community recently. The principal there said to me that he felt like some of the behaviour he was still seeing from students in year 9, the middle year of their secondary school, was more like what he'd expect from students in primary school. So there is a lot of work and support that we need to do. Our government is certainly, through this Student Wellbeing Boost and other programs, providing the support that's much needed.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are committed to providing support through the National Student Wellbeing Program. We're providing $61 million per year for a new five-year agreement. Schools that participate in the program can receive up to $20,280 in most areas, with extra for remote or very remote schools, to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. This staffing, focused on wellbeing, will be supporting students and the wider school community, delivering parcel care services and delivering support services, such as breakfast and lunch clubs, excursions and parent workshops. This funding has been widely welcomed across the community and by organisations that work with and in schools. The Australian Council of State School Organisations have said they are 'extremely pleased' by the announcement the government made. The former head of Independent Schools Australia, Margery Evans, said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The measures in the Budget for the wellbeing of students … show that the Government understands the importance of these issues.
              </p>
              <p>
               The National Catholic Education Commission said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               These much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff. Addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, we do know there is more to be done. That is why the government has tasked the Expert Panel of the Review to Inform a Better and Fairer Education System with advising on how the next schools agreement 'can contribute to improving student mental health and wellbeing'. In its work, the panel has already stated an important point:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Students with good social and emotional wellbeing are more engaged with learning and tend to have higher levels of academic achievement and attainment.
              </p>
              <p>
               So there is a recognition of the challenge we have in front of us. There is a recognition of the support that needs to go into our schools. This will continue to be a focus of work for our government, and I know how important that is to my community and to communities right across Australia.
