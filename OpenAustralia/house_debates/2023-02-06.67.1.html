        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. How is the Albanese Labor government strengthening our national security with our key allies and partners?

         I thank the member for his question. Almost immediately after we rose from question time last year, the foreign minister and I went to the United States, where we participated in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSMIN" rel="nofollow">
          AUSMIN
         </a>
         discussions, and there was a shared sense among both ourselves and the United States that the world's global rules-based order is under as much strain now as at any point since the end of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         and that this demands that Australia and the United States work even more closely together. As a result, we announced an increased tempo of activities and exercises between Australia and the United States. The following day I participated in the AUKUS defence ministers' meeting. I can report to the House that the process for establishing the optimal pathway by which Australia will acquire a nuclear-powered submarine capability is on track, and we will be making that announcement in the very near future. Despite a lost decade from those opposite, which has seen the very real potential of a capability gap opening up with our submarines, I am confident that the pathway we will announce will provide a solution to this as well as give rise to the single biggest evolution in Australia's military capability since the establishment of the

         by the Fisher government in 1913.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week the foreign minister and I were in France. I can again report to the House that, after a difficult 18 months, our relationship with France is back on, thanks very much to the leadership of the Prime Minister. France is a neighbour—a Pacific power—and it matters. Under the Albanese government, France stands in the very top tier of the most important relationships that we have.

         Last week we also participated in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKMIN" rel="nofollow">
          AUKMIN
         </a>
         with our UK counterparts. This is our oldest relationship. But through AUKUS, the free trade agreement, the work that we can now do together on climate change means this relationship is being given a contemporary and forward-looking focus which is deep and substantial. Later this week we'll be meeting in Canberra with our Indonesian counterparts. There again, the agenda is full.

         After these last two months what I can say is that the world is desperate to have Australia back at the table again. When we work with our friends and allies there is so much we can do to advance our national interest in the advance of the Australian people. Spending a decade yelling at the world got us nowhere. But despite the real challenges we face, working with our friends, I am confident that we can walk a path which will keep Australians safe.
