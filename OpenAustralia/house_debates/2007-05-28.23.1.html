       <p>
        Last Saturday, as the patron for Wests Leagues Club Campbelltown, I had the privilege of attending the ninth annual Wests sports council awards. The presentation was not only a recognition of our many fine junior and amateur athletes, but also an opportunity to recognise the contribution of many of those volunteers—coaches, managers, administrators, canteen workers and club people generally—without whose help many of our young people would simply not have a sporting opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the honour to present Australian sports achievement awards to four people who were outstanding in their contribution to their respective clubs.

        and Paul Belgre from the Magpies Cricket Club both have in excess of 20 years of service with their clubs and received life membership. Steve has also spent five years as the president of the Wests council. An award went to Narelle Cullen, who has had in excess of 15 years with the Campbelltown district’s softball club as well as the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Rugby League Football Club and is a prominent local personality. Another went to

        , a remarkable local sportswoman and noted triathlete from the Macarthur Triathlon Club, who not only successfully competed at regional and state levels and also at the national level but has represented this country on a number of occasions. It is only right that we acknowledge the contributions of people who make local sport and competition possible for the children and the youth of my area.
