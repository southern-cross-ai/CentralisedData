        The greatness of Lady Phyllis Cilento: the only female graduate of her class of medicine in 1919; a lady medical officer in the British colonial service; in 1924 had a private practice in

        ; worked in the Hospital for Sick Children from 1931; and from 1928 wrote regular columns for magazines and newspapers as 'Medical Mother' and 'Mother M.D.' promoting good nutrition and raising children, and advocating for natural childbirth, for fathers to be present at the births of their children and for the legalisation of abortion back then. Yet 30 years after her death her name is torn off

        addresses—6,000 votes from just four computers. A cybersecurity expert says there's no way they can be from anywhere else but the minister's office and Queensland ministerial offices. In the August online poll, doctors approached them wanting a name change. Since when does the Labor Party listen to doctors? They said they couldn't raise money at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. What rubbish! Why are public servants abusing their work IP addresses when they could vote from home anyway?

        What a dark day for Queensland, with Labor hatred removing a woman's name from our great hospital. It's not just the name change; it's the lying behind it. It's not telling the truth. It's giving Queenslanders a say and then ignoring it. Queenslanders wanted that name to stay, but the Premier doesn't care, and she's tearing it down.
