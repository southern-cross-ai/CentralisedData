       <p>
        It gives me great pride to stand up today and talk about a former member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        force and one of my bosses, William
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bourke" rel="nofollow">
         John Bourke
        </a>
        , who retired from the Victoria Police force as Detective Senior Sergeant 15649.
       </p>
       <p>
        First of all, I would like to go through his career. He first joined the police force on 10 July 1967. At that time, I was not even born, and he was on the beat. He worked at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Russell Street
        </a>
        police station. On 29 May 1968, he went to work at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         South Melbourne
        </a>
        police station on general duties. In 1971, he worked at Oakleigh police station on general duties. Then he moved to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda" rel="nofollow">
         St Kilda
        </a>
        , where he first became a detective—that was in 1973, in the crime car squads. He moved on to Russell Street
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIB" rel="nofollow">
         CIB
        </a>
        in 1975; Oakleigh CIB in 1976; and City West in 1977, where he took up a position as a sergeant. In 1981, he became a detective sergeant at Russell Street CIB. In 1983, he went to South Melbourne CIB, and back again to Russell Street CIB as a senior sergeant.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went to the major crime squad in 1985. To be a detective in the major crime squad at that time, you had to be a very tough and very dedicated member of the Victoria Police force. He moved on in 1987 to Ferntree Gully CIB, where he was the officer in charge; in 1991 to Knox CIB, where he was again in charge; and finally, in 1996, he was at Boronia CIB. He retired at the age of 57.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Bourke was a fantastic mentor for me personally. He was one of those guys who would go out of his way to help junior members, and I was very fortunate that he selected me to do two weeks of temporary duty at Knox CIB, which eventually ended up as 12 months. He had total respect from all colleagues and criminals alike, which is most important. That shows a person of absolute integrity within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        He served 38 wonderful years with the Victoria Police force. In 2002, he received the police service Good Conduct medal—a 35-year clasp. In retirement, he will be with his wife Carol, who has been his greatest supporter, his three children and five grandchildren. John—otherwise I call him Bourkie—I wish you all the best in your retirement. You have been the person who has done so much for me personally. In fact, in the Victoria Police force, you have no second to the efforts you have given me. Also, it was great to use you as a reference when I was preselected for the seat of Latrobe. Thank you so much, John.
