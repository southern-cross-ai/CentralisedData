        Just last week I was joined by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Townsville" rel="nofollow">
         Mayor of Townsville
        </a>
        to unveil the federal government's investment in street lighting and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras along Riverway Drive in the Upper Ross. We have been able to go all the way from the Riverway precinct and up to Gouldian Avenue. This is soft lighting which makes the walk and run along the side of the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_River" rel="nofollow">
         Ross River
        </a>
        an absolute a joy to behold. Not only that, it is safe to do morning and night as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was doing my listening post up at the Upper Ross and people were coming along and telling me what a great job it was but that they wanted it extended. I have spoken briefly with the mayor about this and she agrees with me that, wherever possible, we will be extending this facility to everyone in Townsville. We want this facility to be rolled out because it does make sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work that council has done on this has been first rate. It has been able to assist with the collection of data and to keep the film; that has also enabled us to not only make it a safe place but also stop crime from existing, because if you shine a light you remove the temptation.

        </a>
        , the Minister for Justice, has done a first-rate job on this, in being able to not only roll out this program to areas which need it, but also to enhance this part of the city. People should feel exactly the same walking along the Strand as they do along the Upper Ross, and this achieves that.
