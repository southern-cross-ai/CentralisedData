        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Integrated fit-out of new leased premises for the

       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of new leased premises at 913 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, Victoria. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        has a substantial presence in the Box Hill region and is currently located in a building at 990 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, which has a lease in place that expires on 30 June 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is expected that relocation into a new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies, and long-term viability through improvements in building infrastructure. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $36 million plus

         GST
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The developer will commence base building works on site in September 2012, with the demolition and excavation of the basement areas being the first tasks.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to proposed parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in July 2013 and be completed by 6 October 2014. The ATO is expected to commence occupancy of the building in November 2014.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney CBD
        </a>
        . This site has been used for tertiary education purposes—for a teachers college—since its development by the New South Wales government in 1969. When colleges of advanced education were amalgamated into universities it was transferred to the

       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal will involve road and civil infrastructure development, followed by the construction of 345 dwellings for an integrated residential community for the

       </p>

        The site will provide housing for families of personnel posted to

        also provides Defence families with opportunities for employment, entertainment and shopping. The project cost of $202 million, inclusive of GST and escalation, but excluding the cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA Sale and Leaseback Program.

        Defence Housing, DHA, proposes to develop an 8.3 hectare prime property at Weston Creek,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . Land is in reasonably short supply in Canberra and the rezoning of land to residential in the greater Molonglo area, of which Weston Creek is part, has opened up an opportunity for DHA to secure land and develop new housing that meets Defence standards in Canberra. The site is located approximately two kilometres from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_College" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence College
        </a>

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal is for the DHA to develop the site for residential construction consistent with the approved Weston Creek estate development plan. Following site development the proposal envisages construction of 50 dwellings for the Department of Defence over a 12-month period. The remaining sites will be sold for complementary development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Development of the site involves the provision of infrastructure of 73 single dwelling lots, of which 50 will be used by Defence families, plus three multi-unit sites that are expected to yield up to 47 dwellings. The first stage will provide this infrastructure. It involves the design and construction of roads, stormwater drainage, sewer, water, natural gas, telecommunications and electricity. Once infrastructure is completed, construction of the 50 dwellings for Defence will be undertaken. The project cost of $39 million, inclusive of GST, but excluding land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the Sale and Leaseback Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed, subject to the recommendations of the committee. DHA accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in January 2013, with dwelling construction to be completed by December 2014.
