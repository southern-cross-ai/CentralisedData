       <p>
        I rise today to celebrate a life well lived and to honour the remarkable contributions of Janette Mary Kennedy—Jan—who passed away on 26 May. Jan made not only an exceptional contribution to the Labor Party but also to women's rights and community health. She was a beacon of inspiration within the Labor Party, tirelessly advocating for the rights and empowerment of women and for all marginalised people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan recognised the importance of gender equality not only within our own ranks but also in the broader fabric of society. Her efforts have left an indelible mark on our party and have paved the way for progress in the important area of women's rights and for people like me to be involved in politics. Jan's contributions extended far beyond the party, with her involvement in community health exemplifying her deep commitment to serving those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan trained as a nurse and midwife and understood the significance of accessible and compassionate health care, particularly for the most vulnerable members of our society. Her tireless work in establishing the Waverley Community Health Centre demonstrated her dedication to those who required support, embodying the essence of community care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jan's impact on our community both within the Labor Party and beyond was so significant and was so cherished. Let her legacy be a reminder that change is possible and that each of us has the power to create a better world. I extend my sympathies to Cyril, her beloved husband, her children, her grandchildren and her extended family. Vale, Jan Kennedy.
