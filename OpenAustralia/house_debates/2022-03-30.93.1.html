       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Yesterday the minister told the House there was $96 million in the budget to clear up the backlog of veterans' compensation claims. Today can the minister tell the House in which budget paper and on what page the $96 million can be found? If he tells us the missing money is in the contingency reserve, what is the expenditure contingent upon?

          I want you to listen to this. At the end of the day, it's not about you, it's not about me and it's not about the critics; it's about the veterans out there. It's about working for veterans, serving veterans and supporting their welfare. We've secured $96 million to clear up the unacceptably high backlog of veteran compensation claims. When I said on Saturday there would be $22.8 million as a line item in the budget, that's exactly what there was. When I said that, the budget had already gone to the printers. I also said yesterday that there would be over $73 million in the contingency fund, and there is; $96 million has been secured.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have to say I have been absolutely overwhelmed by the hundreds of emails of support that I have received from veterans around Australia, both in the ministerial office and in the electorate office. Do you know what they have said? They're glad that someone has gone in to bat for them, called it like it is and stuck their neck out to get something done. So I don't resile from it. I was at a veterans' morning tea with Senator Seselja this morning, and that's exactly what the veterans were saying.
         </p>
         <p>
          It's a great opportunity to talk about the other important measures that were delivered in the budget. There was $70 million to improve the fees paid to veteran home-care providers, making sure that our vulnerable veterans can get the help and support that they need.

                Our veterans put their country above themselves, and they expect a higher form of service from the people in this House. So I appreciate all of the support that I have received from the veteran community, and I want them to know that I am with them all the way. We are determined to get them the support that they need and the support that they deserve. They deserve nothing less from you, from me and from everyone in this House. I will not be backing down from supporting them. I stand by everything I've said, and I stand by everything that I've done.
