        I too rise to acknowledge the great game of cricket that we had in the electorate of Moreton yesterday, where the Muslim community from Moreton took on the Muslim community from Rankin. For the day,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">

        and I were honorary cricketers and also, I guess, honorary Muslims. I want to put on the record that the member for Rankins' team did win by one run. I will acknowledge that. It was a day played in great spirit. I do want to correct the record. The member for Rankin did say that he got me out. However, it was on a free hit so, consequently, technically, whilst he did knock over my stumps, he did not get me out and I managed to get a few runs. It was great.

        I would particularly like to acknowledge Ali Kadri from the

        mosque who organised the players from Moreton. We went to many mosques and schools in my electorate. Next year I hope to repeat the effort and maybe get a victory, but I would also like to go to the other mosques, including the Bosnian mosque, the Indonesian mosque and the Kuraby mosque. Not that the Bosnians and Indonesians are world famous for their cricket, but I am sure they will contribute. It was also great to have
