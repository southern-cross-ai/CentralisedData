        I wish to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Anderson
        </a>
        , who passed away on 17 June. With a brilliant Scottish brogue and a very warm personality, Harry served on the Hornsby
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Club board for 15 years and was president from 2018 until his death. Harry was instrumental in guiding many of the club's recent developments, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_One" rel="nofollow">
         Level One
        </a>
        lounge, the Courtyard bistro, The Brew Bar and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Attic" rel="nofollow">
         The Attic
        </a>
        , which I opened earlier this year. Harry was a thorough gentleman, a real community person and a great exemplar of the spirit of the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Harry joined the Navy at 16 in 1953 and went on to become lieutenant commander. He later enlisted in the

         Royal Australian Naval Reserve
        </a>
        , in 1983, and served as an engineer. His postings including the

         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        naval support staff,

        and general manager of the

        dockyard. Harry was discharged in 1987 and awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Medal
        </a>
        for his 35 years in the Navy. Harry then went on to take his first civilian job with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Submarine_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Submarine Corporation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Harry's work ethic and leadership were second to none. He was also a wonderful family man, devoted to his late wife, Annette, his three children and their spouses, Yvonne and Mark, Greg and Fiona, and Annette and Julian. Harry was very proud of his five grandchildren, Natasha, James, Courtney, Ross and Lorna.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July, Harry Anderson was posthumously awarded life membership of the Hornsby RSL Club. I extend my condolences to Harry's family, friends and colleagues. Harry Anderson will be remembered as a great man, dedicated to the Hornsby RSL Club and to our community.
