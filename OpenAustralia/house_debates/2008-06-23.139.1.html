       <p>
        Tonight I would like to pay tribute to the Hackham West Community Centre. In particular, I want to draw people’s attention to one of the great projects that are run through the Hackham West Community Centre. It is called the community connections project. This program is based at two schools in my electorate—the Hackham South Primary School and the Noarlunga Downs Primary School. This program is about creating bridges, linking parents and their families to their children’s school and, thus, providing an inclusive hub in the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community centre does great work connecting these families by providing them with parenting support and also avenues for training and help to access services within their community. Often parents do not feel comfortable accessing large agencies but they do feel comfortable at the children’s schools. So having a connection point at their local school for these families and parents not only helps them but also helps their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased that this project was a three-year project and was making real headway in the community and I was very pleased that recently their funding was extended for another 12 months. It is a great outcome for the people affected by this program and a great outcome for the Hackham West Community Centre.
