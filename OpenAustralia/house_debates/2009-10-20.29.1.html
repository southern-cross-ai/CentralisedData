         I thank the member for Forde for his question, for reasons which will soon become evident. I launched the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
          Small Business
         </a>
         Support Line on 3 September to provide advisory services to small businesses during the global recession. I am pleased to advise the House that, since the support line became operational, 2,226 calls have been received from small businesses. That support line is being staffed by a team of eight advisers, each with extensive small business experience. Yet again, in criticising the support line, the member for Moncrieff has got it wrong. In a press release of 17 August, he claimed that the Small Business Support Line ‘will be staffed by bureaucrats and offer none of the tangible help which small businesses need day to day’. I can report that a survey of callers reveals a 90 per cent satisfaction rate with the Small Business Support Line. It is staffed by small business advisers with extensive small business experience, not bureaucrats, and is very, very popular—90 per cent satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked about impediments to the support line and the government’s effort to support small business. The shadow minister for small business is an impediment to the government’s policies. Is it any wonder that, in the list of the

            has identified the member for Moncrieff as an impediment. In fact, he is sinking like a stone. I can advise the House that it is now 509 days since the member for Moncrieff last asked me a question. I did thank the member for Forde for his question, and there was an especially good reason for that. I note that the member for Forde is a bullet performer in the top 100 most influential people on the Gold Coast—entering for the first time at 75 and rising fast. Do you know what the

            says about the member for Forde and his commitment to this area? It points out that the member for Forde’s office is in Beenleigh. Beenleigh is in

                 Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Clearly, the minister is not being relevant to the question. He is also making a mockery of question time, and I would ask you to ask him to sit down.
