       <p>
        I have so many amazing community groups and sports clubs in my electorate of Boothby, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenelg_Baseball_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Glenelg Baseball Club
        </a>
        is no exception. This year I've had the pleasure of visiting the club on a number of occasions, together with my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        colleague Matt Cowdrey MP, the member for Colton, to see their facilities and to spend time with President Matt Jones, life member
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bradley" rel="nofollow">

        and the many players and supporters and incredible volunteers of this fantastic local club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also delighted to attend the Glenelg Baseball Club senior presentation dinner in April to celebrate the end of a very successful 2018-19 season. The club had 10 teams playing finals this season, with seven advancing to the grand final. I congratulate the under-13 juniors, the division 3 and division 4 senior men's sides and the division 2 women's side on their premiership-winning performances.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we have seen with sports clubs throughout my community, participation in grassroots sports is growing, particularly female participation. And the Glenelg Baseball Club is, once again, no exception. That's why I was proud to secure a $100,000 federal funding grant to help upgrade the change room facilities at the club. These facilities will ensure the club can continue to support the growth in player numbers across their male, female, junior and senior sides. I would like to sincerely thank Matt and Bob for working with me to secure this funding, and I look forward to visiting the club again soon.
