       <p>
        Today I'd like to share the story of an impressive young woman from Frankston, Olivia Morley. Olivia is just 17-years-old and she recently competed with the Australian Dragon Boat Team, called the Auroras, at the World Dragon Boat Racing Championships in Thailand. At the championships Olivia and her team brought home seven bronze medals out of eight possible events, and Australia secured the fifth position amongst 22 competing countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Olivia's journey into dragon boating is somewhat unique. She got into the sport because her grandmother started dragon boating, in an unfortunately not so unique story, after a breast cancer diagnosis. Her grandmother's involvement in dragon boating has led it to it becoming a bit of a family affair. Olivia's whole family is involved. Even her older cousin competes for Australia. Olivia trains once a week during the off-season and two to three times a week during competitions. In the lead-up to Thailand, she trained four times a week with her mum driving her from my electorate all the way to the city for all of the sessions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Olivia's proud mum and grandmother accompanied her to Thailand, where they say the smile did not leave her face. Olivia has made her family and Australia proud with her hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to wish good luck to our Aussie athletes competing at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Invictus Games
        </a>
        in Germany next week. The Invictus Games are an international adaptive sporting event for serving and former defence personnel. The games use the power of sport to inspire recovery and support rehabilitation. Importantly, they generate a wider understanding and respect for wounded, injured and ill service personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the athletes from my electorate who is going is Francine from Seaford. Francine is a former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        medic who deals with chronic lower back pain. Despite her challenges, Francine focuses on how sport aids her rehabilitation. She says: 'Sport has been amazing for me and something I have done my whole life. It keeps me accountable and, more importantly, helps me form connections with other people.' Francine will be competing in powerlifting, rowing and sitting volleyball. So from all of us in Dunkley: Well done, Olivia, and good luck, Francine.
