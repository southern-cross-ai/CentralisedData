       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to refurbish 43 staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Tokyo, Japan. This proposal was referred to the Public Works Committee on 21 June 2007, but the reference lapsed when the previous committee ceased to exist with the prorogation of parliament on 15 October 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government built the existing embassy complex and has occupied it since 1990. The complex comprises the chancery, apartments and recreational facilities. The proposal is to undertake internal refurbishment of all 43 staff apartments. The works will include upgrading building services. They will ensure compliance with current standards and building codes and enhanced amenity for tenants, as well as protecting the government’s long-term commercial investment and rental value in the property. The Australian government owns the embassy complex, which was valued at $258.25 million in 2006. The estimated cost of the proposal is $22 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2009, with completion in 2010. I commend the motion to the House.

        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a redevelopment of Robertson Barracks, the home of the Army’s 1st Brigade.

        The Hardened and Networked Army initiative, which was approved by government in December 2005, greatly strengthens the Army’s protection, mobility, firepower and communications, allowing operations in more complex, dangerous and uncertain environments. This proposal was referred to the Public Works Committee on 9 August 2007, but the reference lapsed when the previous committee ceased to exist with the prorogation of parliament on 15 October 2007. The initiative will increase options for the government in terms of both the combat weight of the force that can be deployed and the duration that forces can be sustained on operations. As part of this initiative the 7th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, 7RAR, is being reraised as a mechanised infantry battalion. The battalion currently occupies temporary facilities in Darwin but will be based at Edinburgh Defence Precinct, Adelaide, along with supporting artillery, combat engineer and logistics troops.

       <p>
        The Hardened and Networked Army Facilities project at Edinburgh Defence Precinct, at an estimated outturn cost of $623.68 million plus GST, will provide working accommodation and training facilities, urban warfare training facilities, a driver training area, a vehicle wash point and common user facilities for both Army and

It will also deliver economic benefits for South Australia and provide a popular posting location for Army personnel.
