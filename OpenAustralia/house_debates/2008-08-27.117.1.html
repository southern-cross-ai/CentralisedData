        I rise today to put on the record my congratulations to the Jape family for their significant business celebrations. Last week I had the pleasure of attending the Jape Furnishing Superstore’s 30th birthday celebrations. As with so many Chinese-Timorese family businesses operating in Solomon, the history of the family and the store is fascinating. Jape
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Su" rel="nofollow">
         Kong Su

        arrived in Darwin in 1975, just after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy" rel="nofollow">
         Cyclone Tracy
        </a>
        . Although he spoke no English and knew very little about Australia, he was able to establish and successfully operate a small business supplying urgently needed accommodation in Darwin. In 1977, he embarked on a major project by building the Jape Shopping Centre. The Jape Shopping Centre was a success and had a snowballing effect, as other developments started to emerge in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy. Two sons also started a new business venture, and the Jape Furnishing Superstore was opened in October 1978 at the Jape Shopping Centre.

        In 1989, the furnishing superstore was relocated to its current address in the next big project, the Jape Homemaker Village in suburban Millner. Today the Jape Furnishing Superstore employs over 300 staff and is a leading domestic and commercial furniture supplier in the

        </a>
        . The Jape Homemaker Village has grown from strength to strength since then, to include national stores like

        provide great options for people in Darwin and Palmerston. I know the people of Solomon enjoy shopping in the precinct, which offers a wide range of largely specialty stores in a convenient location.
       </p>
       <p>
        Solomon is home to people from all corners of the globe, and this diversity has shaped our part of the world for the better, particularly in our local business community. In the business community, Territorians of Chinese origin provide profound benefits to the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Successful businesses operated by the Lai, Lee, Yap, Tchia, Mu and Lay families, to name but a few, have been significant in the development and prosperity of Darwin and Palmerston. I should also say that, just like all the Chinese-Timorese community businesses in Darwin, the Jape group not only serves Territorians in the business community but also is very active in the wider community by being involved in local community work and donating to charities, schools and social groups. Once again, I congratulate the Jape family, along with all the Chinese-Timorese family businesses, for their valued, continuing contribution to the people of Solomon.
