        I'm proud today to speak about some very talented young individuals in the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . The Local Sporting Champions program provides financial support of up to $750 for travel costs to sporting championships. I'm glad that so many young sporting stars have been awarded the opportunity to be a local sporting champion under this program. Many of them have received financial support of up to $700 to attend the 2020 international school basketball under-15 cup in Croatia. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate these sporting champions and wish them the very best of luck in the upcoming championship. Some of these very young and talented people are Lachlan Currie, 14; Luke Fennell, 13; Phoenix Windsor, 13; Hayley Letts, 13; Kaitlyn Scott, 15; Ethan Bolton, 14; Dakota Crichton, 14; Rebekah Dumont, 14; Jessica-Belle Catheray-Harvey, 14; Cedric Rault, 13;

        They all have very bright futures and are all doing exceptionally well. On behalf of the Australian government and all members of parliament, to all our young people right across the country who've received this opportunity: we acknowledge your fantastic efforts, your dedication and your commitment but, above all, your leadership to other young people in the area, because, every day you're out there training and giving it your absolute best, you're being watched by your friends and your peers. To all the parents who are always driving to various training events and championship events: we thank you very much for everything you do in supporting your children and giving them this great opportunity. As the member for La Trobe, I congratulate all those who have received this opportunity. We very much look forward to watching you in the future. Keep up the great work.
