        Last Tuesday's paper ran a story from 1964 when the mayor, Rex Pilbeam, was quoted as saying, 'Two civic projects were completed during the year â€” the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Theatre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the road to the top of Mt Archer.' Also in 1964 the council resolved to spend $5 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_River" rel="nofollow">
         Fitzroy River
        </a>
        barrage and treatment works. These are major civic infrastructure works championed and carried out by the Rockhampton council of the day. Later in the week our current mayor, Councillor Carter, delivered with much fanfare his major achievement: a new brochure. I was invited to its launch, but only as an obvious afterthought. I did, however, get a copy and when you open it there is nothing of what this council has built, unlike the case in 1964, rather every page has in bold type 'We need' and 'We want'. This is typical of the whining from the mayor directed at the Commonwealth government. Every week there is an hysterical headline from Councillor Carter: 'Rudd out of touch', 'Rudd slammed over oil spill', 'Residents let down', and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been patient, hoping the mayor would work out that he needs to start achieving something of substance himself before he can be taken seriously by other levels of government, but instead the harassment has increased. It is interesting to note that Councillor Carter was, from 1991, the regional director for state development in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He was the bureaucrat with responsibility for developing our infrastructure needs. He has had 20 years to make things happen in Rockhampton but instead spends his time as mayor looking for others to blame.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, Councillor Carter last week launched an investment brochure for Rockhampton and complained that I was not present. Well I had a lot on last week. Senator Ludwig flew into town with $2.4 million for the 2012 beef expo. On Tuesday I was in Yeppoon meeting with constituents. On Wednesday I hosted the infrastructure minister,

        </a>
        , to ensure he understands the need for a long-term solution for Rockhampton's road and rail problem, not a quick fix. On Thursday I hosted a meeting between

        and the regional Australia minister,

        , to gain his support for the innovative Central Queensland University and Central Queensland

        amalgamation. And on Friday I visited Moranbah to celebrate the opening of $3 million worth of school buildings. Meanwhile I was negotiating with the offices of various ministers on other important projects. This shows that I accept responsibility for the federal government's record of delivery in Capricornia. Ahead of next year's council election Councillor Carter needs to stop commentating on the federal government's performance and start doing something about his.

        Rockhampton was recently included in the 10 regions to receive intensive assistance to break the cycle of disadvantage that many agree contributes to the city's social problems and juvenile crime. The mayor's only comment was to complain that no-one told him that Rockhampton had been identified as having these problems. Meanwhile, the local paper has done an excellent job in keeping this issue in front of the public for the last 2 years, I have made well-reported speeches about it and you only have to talk to people in parts of our city to know how frightening some of the juvenile criminal activities have become. But again it is someone else's fault because the federal government did not tell Councillor Carter in advance about its budget plans. It is not my job to hold his hand or to put up with his campaign of whining and harassment. I understand that Councillor Carter has had problems in previous employment and has even had counselling for bullying and harassment. What he needs to understand is that, just like the feisty old ladies in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depot_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I will not be bullied or intimidated.
       </p>

        Last Friday's paper had the mayor accusing the government of neglecting the region, specifically with regard to a lack of funds for critical road and rail services. Rockhampton has a 19th century railway bridge across the Fitzroy River. The railway line runs down the main street and we have B-double trucks moving live cattle through the centre of our town to supply two of the largest meatworks in Australia. It is well past time that these issues are attended to. In the meantime, in January, Rockhampton experienced a major flood. While not as big as previous floods, it was big enough and Rockhampton was cut off from the south for a period of time. This has resulted in the mayor and, to some extent, the state government losing sight of the big picture, which is not to simply construct flood-free access but to also remove cattle trucks and trains from the centre of Rockhampton. The mayor wants a quick fix he can take to next year's election. But I will not be moved on this. I am determined to provide a plan for the city's future that will ensure we not only achieve a greater degree of flood-proofing for Rockhampton but also remove the 19th-century infrastructure and cattle trucks from our city. Let us see Councillor Carter get on with his job and see if he can be re-elected in the next four council elections as I have done in the last four federal elections.
