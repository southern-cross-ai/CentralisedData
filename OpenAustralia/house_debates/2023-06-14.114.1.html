         Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—This will be Australia's 40th bilateral extradition treaty, which reflects the importance the government places on international engagement on matters of serious and transnational crime. Bilateral extradition treaties help ensure that the extradition process is simplified and more effective.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        extradition treaty outlines the process for the surrender of an individual from one country to the other for criminal prosecution or to serve a prison sentence, and the treaty ensures the streamlining of cooperation between the two countries and their responses to extradition requests and processing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia and the Czech Republic are like-minded countries with a mutual interest in responding to crime. By working together in this area the two countries will contribute to holding those who've committed crimes accountable, whether through prosecution in a court of law or through serving a prison sentence. Key reasons for the proposed treaty action and the cooperation it enables include the general cost of serious and organised crime for Australia, which was between $24.8 and $60.1 billion in 2020-21. The crimes include the importation of illicit drugs, trafficking and other illicit commodities, and, of course, cybercrime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ratification of this treaty will also contribute to ensuring that individuals who have left Australia will not be able to avoid justice by crossing borders. Equally, Australia will be able to assist other countries in the return and prosecution of people charged with serious crimes. This treaty will strengthen the relationship between Australia and the Czech Republic as partners in law enforcement and will be particularly helpful in areas such as the manufacture and transshipment of synthetic drugs and with respect to serious cybercrime.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties held a public hearing, as part of the inquiry into this treaty, which included addressing questions about the grounds for extradition refusal, the number and cost of extradition processes in which Australia is involved, and the importance of such agreements being consistent with Australia's position with respect to both opposing and actively seeking the abolition of the death penalty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all committee members and the deputy chair for their contribution to the inquiry. On the basis of everything I've said, the committee supports the extradition treaty and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.

        <p>
         by leave—I thank the House for the opportunity to make a brief statement on this report. One of the most important duties this parliament has is to do everything we can to ensure we keep Australians safe. That's exactly what the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow">
          Czech Republic
         </a>
         aims to do. Signed by the former coalition government, this treaty strengthens the law enforcement cooperation relationship between our two countries. We have 39 such treaties with other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the national interest analysis notes, the key reason for the treaty is the general cost of serious and organised crime: up to $60 billion in 2021. Specifically, our engagement with the Czech Republic includes efforts to combat the manufacture and shipment of synthetic drugs as well as serious cybercrime. At the centre of this treaty action is the intention to create a comprehensive framework between Australia and the Czech Republic that will facilitate the surrender of a person from one country to the other country for the purposes of criminal prosecution or the imposition or service of a criminal sentence. The last thing our law enforcement authorities need when wanting to stop crime or take drugs off our streets is an uncertain process with no guarantee of an outcome. This treaty will help minimise that uncertainty. Importantly, it includes provisions for urgent cases, where a requesting country can apply for the provisional arrest of a person whose extradition will be requested at a later stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'd like to thank the chair, the committee and those who help us in the secretariat. I commend the report to the House and thank the committee for its recommendation that binding treaty action be taken.
