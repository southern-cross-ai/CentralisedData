       <p>
        This speech was written by Noah Block, 19 years old, from my electorate, as part of Raise Our Voice Australia. 'Consent: a word which has caused debate, conflict and division in recent times; a word which is so important yet so undervalued and so often misunderstood. As young people, we have had enough: enough debating, enough conflict and enough division. What we want instead are answers, so in that spirit this speech was written not to provoke problems but to invoke answers. These answers may seem hard to find, but, if you listen to the young people of today, they are a lot simpler than what may seem.
       </p>
       <p>
        'All we ask for is clear, specific and honest education when it comes to consent and sexual health. This education must be inclusive, diverse and reflective of all identities in our country. These issues won't go away unless something is done, unless nationwide consent education programs are introduced to senior schools, universities, workplaces and to all in our country who are responsible for raising the next generation of youth. The impact programs like these could have if done right would be far greater than what may initially seem. Healthy conversations around sex and consent can develop our country into a far more inclusive, accepting and safe placeâ€”a place that my generation would be proud to live in in 20 years time.'
       </p>

        Thank you, Noah.
