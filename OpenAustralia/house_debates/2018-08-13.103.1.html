        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this drought that is enveloping much of eastern Australia and particularly his electorate. This is an evolving situation and it's one in which the government will continue to be agile. We understand that it's not just farmers that hurt; it's also small communities that hurt. So it's important we understand that, under the agreements we have with the state, the state's responsibilities during the drought are to look after animal welfare—the freight and fodder—and it's the federal government's responsibility to look after human welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm proud to say that, since we've come to power, we've invested over $1.4 billion not only in concessional loans but in direct support to family households and the communities. Only in the last couple of weeks, we've increased that household support to farming families to $37,626. That's to help them put bread and butter on the table, take the household pressures off them and let them have some clear thinking. But, to complement that, we've invested another $25 million in more rural financial counselling services, and $8½ million of that is putting new boots on the ground. This is an investment in the real angels that are out there that sit around farmers' kitchen tables, that get underneath the bonnet of our farmers' businesses and help them make the tough decisions and the strategic decisions about their future. That's an investment in not only agriculture but our people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also looking towards preparedness. We're making big investments into pests and weeds, which cost agriculture around $6 billion a year. And $35 million is being spent ensuring that we increase farm productivity to ensure farmers get from one drought to the next. It's important that we've also brought the banks on this journey with them. We've brought them, kicking and screaming, in offsetting the farm management deposits—the $6.62 billion in farm management deposits that the banks have from farmers who put aside money in the good times to offset against their loans. It'll save farmers tens of thousands of dollars into the future. That's an investment in agriculture's future. We've got the banks, who are the capital providers to agriculture, to come on that journey with us. We've also made an additional $11.4 million investment into mental health. That's on top of the new investment around allowing the Medicare rebate to be given to those receiving psychological assistance online, for those farmers who are doing it tough. They'll be able to do it in the dignity and sanctity of their own home.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I say to every farming family: the story of agriculture is a good one. The story of agriculture is: just add rain. I can tell you that when the rain comes the good times will come, and your government, the Australian people, will stand shoulder to shoulder with you, because we believe not only in you and not only in agriculture but also in your communities.
