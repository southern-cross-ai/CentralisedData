         Laurie Lawrence
        </a>
        is a name that most Australians would know quite well. It is a name that would be known to all those who have a love of rugby, because, of course, he was an Australian rugby union representative; indeed, he played for the Wallabies. His name would be known also to those who have a love of swimming, because he coached Olympic and world champion Australian swimmers. His swimmers won gold medals and participated in Brisbane’s 1982

        and in Edinburgh’s 1986 Commonwealth Games, as well as at the

        in 1992. His is a name that is much admired and respected throughout Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Lawrence
        </a>
        ’s name today to pay tribute to his passion, his integrity, his authenticity and his love for Australia. Above all that is his absolute desire to save lives, his absolute love of Australian children and his desire to save their lives when they are near water. All those who are familiar with Mr Lawrence’s name would know that he is a man who has developed an incredible program with the support of federal governments, both past and present, and he has put together a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
         DVD
        </a>
        that will help parents and young toddlers to learn the techniques for being safe in and around water. As the father of a 3½-year-old I can say that my wife and I and our little 3½-year-old, Ryan, have watched the DVD on many, many occasions. Indeed, we watched it during the past weekend before my trip to Canberra for this sitting week. I want to pay tribute to Mr Laurie Lawrence because he is someone who will work with anybody. It does not matter whether you are a member of the federal parliament, a state parliament or a council, a community group or a charity—all of those stakeholders desire the same outcome: saving the lives of children to avoid tragedies in families around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will touch on some statistics that I think are important. More so, behind these figures is human tragedy; behind these figures there are the names of little children who have lost their lives and there is immense suffering in homes and families around Australia. I will put on the record that, as a member of the Australian parliament, as a local MP, as an Australian citizen and, indeed, as a father, I will do everything I can to bring mums and dads together, to conduct community events and to bring community organisations together to highlight the importance of water safety. Whether it is around pools, or dams or lakes, we simply must be vigilant as parents and as community minded citizens. It is not yet the end of February and already in Australia more than 70 lives have been lost to drowning Australia wide. In Queensland alone as of last Tuesday, 23 February, 16 Queenslanders had lost their lives to drowning including six children under the age of five. As I say, behind those figures is, of course, great suffering, great tragedy and great pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Mr Laurie Lawrence again for his time, his commitment and his passion in doing something about these tragedies. If all of us can do a little bit more then potentially that little bit more could become a lifesaver. I also want to thank him for taking the time on 25 January this year to visit the Ryan electorate and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        to show the mums and dads and their toddlers techniques that could potentially save not only the lives of their children but the lives of their neighbours’ children or others that might be around swimming pools. Tragically, only in the last few days three young Australian toddlers lost their lives. We share the pain and the grief of those families and we pray that their souls will rest in peace.
