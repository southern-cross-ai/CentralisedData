         In the other place, the government voted down Labor’s sensible suggested amendments and protections to the

         </a>
         , which were going to provide better protection for the B-party interceptions that are proposed under this regime. Labor recognises that the bill taken as a whole is an advance for privacy and for the scrutiny that will apply for these new interceptions. However, we were concerned that the B-party content of this bill was not time critical and not subject to the stored communication sunset clause which has caused this bill to be dealt with in great haste. In those circumstances, it seems to us that it would have been possible for the government to agree to our proposal to delay consideration of schedule 2, but this proposal from Labor has been refused.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even when the debate on this matter was on in the other place, we were concerned that the government had not to date brought forward its legislation to establish a commission for law enforcement integrity. That legislation has now been introduced into the House after two years of the government promising that it would deliver it. On a number of occasions when we were required and requested to support this sort of legislation, Labor noted that we were concerned that the government was going to both broaden its powers and provide new powers to a number of agencies without this integrity commission being in place. We welcome the introduction of this legislation by the government. It is detailed legislation and we will be looking more closely to ensure that the oversight body does have the powers that it needs, including any relevant powers that it needs for overseeing the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         regime and making sure that it is safe and effective from an anticorruption point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I say, the Labor Party has been concerned that the B-party interception provisions were not time critical, were not covered by the oversight of a federal anticorruption commission, were not covered by the reasonable safeguards that were recommended by an all-party Senate committee and were not covered by the safeguard amendments that Labor developed as a result of the committee recommendations and that it put forward in the other place. We are very disappointed that the government has chosen not to accept Labor’s proposals. Labor will, in government, pursue the safeguards that have been recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation committee and that were moved as amendments in the other place.
        </p>
        <p>
         At least Labor took the time to develop the amendments, which were based on those committee recommendations. We did this in less than 24 hours with the limited resources that are available to the opposition. The Attorney-General failed to even bother to develop amendments of his own to cover these matters, despite having the resources of an entire department at his disposal. I well know this, because, even in speaking on relatively minor legislation in the Main Committee, I have on a number of occasions in recent days counted seven or eight officials. But when it comes to something that is as significant as this, where detailed recommendations are made by a Senate committee, the government says that it does not have time to consider those properly and move amendments that would take account of those unanimous recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Instead of dealing with those recommendations while the bill is at hand, the government has given some sort of vague commitment that it will look at these in the future. But really, Minister, there is no excuse for having taken this amount of time. You could have looked at those recommendations when they were made on Monday. The way this chamber works to deal with matters expeditiously would have enabled the minister to move appropriate amendments, but he has taken a lazy approach and not bothered to do that. This reflects the contempt of this government, and particularly this minister, for the process in trying to get urgent legislation through. The result comes at a cost and there is a compromise: the government is not getting the best sort of legislation through, because it could improve it. It also shows a serious contempt for the minister’s own backbench members who wrote the recommendations of the Senate committee report and are after all trying to represent the Australian community and put forward the best piece of legislation possible. It is a lazy approach by the minister. He should motivate himself to actually look at the amendments that we moved in the other place and that would have fixed this weak piece of legislation. We urge the government to do so at the earliest opportunity.

            Our party room likes to be informed. It is informed by a backbench committee consideration, and they like to have the material before them as they do consider bills. I can assure the opposition that the consideration that is given is substantial and effects improvements to legislation quite frequently. That is the task that they like to undertake.

            committee took some weeks. They would say that it was an expeditious consideration of this bill. But it was some weeks, and the committee report was tabled on Monday. I want to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for their consideration and report. I have read it with interest. A number of amendments have been made to the
            <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2506" rel="nofollow">
             Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006
            </a>
            in recognition of issues that were raised by our colleagues. Those government amendments that were moved took into account matters that were raised before the committee where we had to divine whether or not they would make recommendations. Many of the amendments that we proposed and that have been accepted by the Senate reflected that consideration.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government has illustrated its commitment in this bill to ensure that security and law enforcement agencies are equipped with appropriate powers to combat and prevent serious crime, including terrorism. Specifically, the bill updates these powers to keep pace with technological developments that assist the suspects evading investigation. This bill represents the most substantial reforms to the interception regime since its inception. The bill continues to reflect the government’s consistent efforts to ensure that there are appropriate privacy provisions and protections for users of communications and that these protections are maintained alongside enhanced access powers for law enforcement and security agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The implementation of the recommendations of the Blunn report on the regulation of access to communications provides greater certainty and clarity to those agencies, to telecommunication industry participants and to users of telecommunications systems. The new stored communication warrant regime does strike a careful balance—on the one hand creating a new prima facie protection for stored communications whilst on the other hand creating a defined regime to provide law enforcement agencies with appropriate access.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bill also makes important amendments to the interception regime to assist agencies to counter measures adopted by persons suspected of serious criminal activity in evading interception. Interception under the new B-party interception provisions will only be used as an investigatory tool of last resort, it will be subject to strict controls and it will only be available for investigation of the most serious crimes. Strong safeguards which currently underpin the interception regime will continue to apply. These include restrictions on the use of any intercepted material as well as current requirements for independent oversight and annual reporting to parliament.
           </p>
           <p>
            I conclude by saying that this bill is to deal with matters that would otherwise be the subject of a sunset clause dealing with stored communications. We did not want to see those important measures come to an end, and that is why the legislation has been progressed not in haste but to ensure that these issues have been dealt with before that sunset clause comes into effect. The government will continue to consider in detail the committee report and the recommendations as part of its ongoing commitment to ensuring the regime achieves an appropriate balance. If there are further amendments that are thought to be appropriate following the consideration of the committee report, we will propose further amendments in the spring session of parliament. That is as I think it should be. I commend the amendments to the House. I think the urgency is apparent.

            <p>
             I just have to comment briefly on the extraordinary comments that the Attorney-General has just made, which essentially ask this House to accept the nonsense that the government cannot move to make improvements to their own piece of legislation following their own backbench committee, along with members of the Labor Party in the Senate making recommendations, because they have not been through his party room process. It is ridiculous to come into the parliament, the law-making body of this country, and say that improvements cannot be made to a quite radical new regime that is being set up, because the Attorney-General has not had time to take it through his party room.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course all of us in this place understand that processes need to be gone through. But we are being asked to rush through a piece of legislation that will have a significant impact—and that is what the B-party intercept in schedule 2 of the
             <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2506" rel="nofollow">
              Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006
             </a>
             will have; it will have a significant impact by changing the current regime as it applies—without improvements that have been recommended by a unanimous Senate committee. The Attorney-General is saying that the government cannot move to make improvements because he has not asked his backbench.
            </p>
            <p>
             I could not let those comments go without making the comment that we regard the parliament as the law-making body here, not his backbench committee or the party room. Those processes can be gone through and should be gone through. It is not beyond the wit of the minister to be able to organise one of those meetings if he had any particular desire to do so. Again, it is a complete nonsense to suggest that they have not had time to draft these sorts of amendments. You have incredibly good staff in the Clerk’s office both in the House and in the Senate who are able to draft amendments all the time, you have
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC" rel="nofollow">
              OPC
             </a>
             and you have your own departments. It is really just a lack of will on the part of the government to improve this system.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this is the third or fourth time now that the minister has said, ‘I am aware that this legislation could be better, but I call on this House to pass the legislation and we will improve it in the future.’ We saw that with the legislation on sedition. We have seen it with a number of other pieces of legislation in the past few months, all under this Attorney’s responsibility. We are being asked again today to accept a bill that could be improved were the minister to take the time to do it. We do accept the other changes. We accept that the latest amendments that are being moved are an improvement. But there are further improvements that could have been made if only the Attorney had taken the time to do that himself or instruct his many staff to do it for him.

                  It is a committee report in which there are recommendations that need to be the subject of detailed consideration. Of course, you might be able to draft amendments to reflect what the committee has decided—if you are not prepared to go behind and look at the policy implications of the measures that are being proposed and to involve all of those who are likely to be affected.

                      Yes, I agree that I would have to be very old—I know it is going to be a long time! But the point I make is that I am sure, in that situation, there would be examples in which she would be placed in wanting to effect very important measures that ought to be on the statute book so that the impact of a sunset clause, which would wipe out our capacity to deal with stored communications, were avoided.

                           To suggest when I said that that I was misleading the House, and then to accept the correction and substitute some other words, I think reflects just that. The point I make is that there is urgency associated with this legislation. It is in a form that was acceptable to government members. My goodwill, as evidenced in a desire to further consider matters that have been raised in a bipartisan way in the Senate, should not be made light of in the way the member for Gellibrand has. It is only more likely to serve to encourage people to become more intransigent.
