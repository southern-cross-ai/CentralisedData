       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) 14 May 2018 is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the modern state of Israel, a seminal event that occurred in 1948; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) congratulates Israel on an amazing seventy years of democracy, growth and prosperity;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that 15 July 2018 marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the fateful Évian Conference, convened by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Roosevelt" rel="nofollow">
         President Roosevelt
        </a>
        in 1938 in Évian-Jes-Bains France, with 31 countries, to discuss the issue of the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the horror of Nazi persecution;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Australian Minister for Trade and Customs in 1938, Lieutenant Colonel T.W. White, declined to further assist the Jewish people, stating 'Australia has her own particular difficulties ... migration has naturally been predominantly British, and it (is not) desired that this be largely departed from while British settlers are forthcoming. Under the circumstances Australia cannot do more, for it will be appreciated that in a young country manpower from the source from which most of its citizens have sprung is preferred, while undue privileges cannot be given to one particular class of non-British subjects without injustices to others. It will no doubt be appreciated also that as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration…I hope that the conference will find a solution of this tragic world problem';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) post Kristallnacht, when the Nazis burned Jewish synagogues, businesses and books, Australia did reassess its policy to admit 15,000 refugees over three years, compared to the previous quota of 1,800 per year;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others died during the Holocaust, exacerbated by the failure of Australia and other nations of the world to more fully protect the Jewish people; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Government of Australia
        </a>

        in Jerusalem, as a representative response for all other nations' responses of indifference at the Évian Conference;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) states that this Parliament, as representative of all political parties and the people of Australia, issues a profound apology and says 'sorry' to the Jewish people for the indifference shown by the Parliament in 1938 that worsened the impact of the Holocaust; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in doing so, we seek to honour the memory of all those who lost their lives in the Holocaust and make right, a great wrong, perpetuated by Australia on the Jewish people;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) a request will be made for this motion to be presented to Yad Vashem this 70th year asking that the parliamentary apology be displayed beside Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement of 1938 that he issued on behalf of the Government of Australia; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this motion will be provided to the Knesset this 70th year, one parliament to another.

        : Debate to be resumed on the motion of Mr Robert—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) 14 May 2018 is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the modern state of Israel, a seminal event that occurred in 1948; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) congratulates Israel on an amazing seventy years of democracy, growth and prosperity;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that 15 July 2018 marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the fateful Évian Conference, convened by President Roosevelt in 1938 in Évian-Jes-Bains France, with 31 countries, to discuss the issue of the plight of Jewish refugees fleeing the horror of Nazi persecution;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Australian Minister for Trade and Customs in 1938, Lieutenant Colonel T.W. White, declined to further assist the Jewish people, stating 'Australia has her own particular difficulties ... migration has naturally been predominantly British, and it (is not) desired that this be largely departed from while British settlers are forthcoming. Under the circumstances Australia cannot do more, for it will be appreciated that in a young country manpower from the source from which most of its citizens have sprung is preferred, while undue privileges cannot be given to one particular class of non-British subjects without injustices to others. It will no doubt be appreciated also that as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration…I hope that the conference will find a solution of this tragic world problem';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) post Kristallnacht, when the Nazis burned Jewish synagogues, businesses and books, Australia did reassess its policy to admit 15,000 refugees over three years, compared to the previous quota of 1,800 per year;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) an estimated 6 million Jews and millions of others died during the Holocaust, exacerbated by the failure of Australia and other nations of the world to more fully protect the Jewish people; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement on behalf of the Government of Australia is still visible at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem, as a representative response for all other nations' responses of indifference at the Évian Conference;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) states that this Parliament, as representative of all political parties and the people of Australia, issues a profound apology and says 'sorry' to the Jewish people for the indifference shown by the Parliament in 1938 that worsened the impact of the Holocaust; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in doing so, we seek to honour the memory of all those who lost their lives in the Holocaust and make right, a great wrong, perpetuated by Australia on the Jewish people;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) a request will be made for this motion to be presented to Yad Vashem this 70th year asking that the parliamentary apology be displayed beside Lieutenant-Colonel White's statement of 1938 that he issued on behalf of the Government of Australia; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) this motion will be provided to the Knesset this 70th year, one parliament to another.

       <p class="italic">
        (1) observes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the National Partnership on Remote Housing (NPRH) is an agreement between the Australian Government and state/territory governments to deliver new and refurbished housing for remote and Indigenous communities; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that the NPRH agreement is due to expire on 30 June 2018;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) over the last ten years, the NPRH has delivered in Queensland almost 1,150 new homes and 1,500 refurbished homes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Australian Government's independent review into the partnership has highlighted the achievements of the

        </a>

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        councils who, along with Indigenous businesses now deliver 80 per cent of housing construction and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) nationally, an additional 5,500 homes are required by 2028 to account for population growth and to continue to reduce overcrowding;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) without continued funding, loss of hundreds of local jobs and apprenticeships will occur;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) without funding, significant levels of violence—domestic and otherwise—will arise from overcrowded living conditions in some of the communities; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) secure housing is a key element of the Australian Government's priority of 'Closing the Gap' responsibilities; and

        (4) calls on the Australian Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) urgently restore commitment to this program, in order to reduce overcrowding in discrete and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, through building new dwellings and continuing to maintain and refurbish existing dwellings; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) commit to a ten-year continuation of Commonwealth funding in real terms, matching the same level as provided over the last ten years.
