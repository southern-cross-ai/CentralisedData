        On 20 May I had the honour to present three national medals to members of the

        </a>
        at Tuncurry. Neville Keith Turton is one of the founding members of the Tuncurry Rural Fire Brigade. Neville joined in 1956, holding the rank of senior deputy captain for 41 years. Neville has maintained his level of efficiency, continually being available for operational call-out and community service. Since he stood down as senior deputy captain, he has held the position of permit-issuing officer and continues to give good service to the brigade. Neville was elected to life membership of the brigade in 1990.

        I also presented a medal to Keith Edward Gleave. Keith joined Coomba Park Brigade in 1984 and was active until 2002, serving as captain from 1989 until 1998. Highlight events were fundraising to purchase a category 9 appliance in 1992 to supplement the category 1 and 2 tanker trailers. In the bad fire season of 1991 Keith was in command of the Coomba area of brigades from Bulahdelah, Bungwahl,

        and Tuncurry. Keith was active in training members of his brigade and others, being a rural training coordinator until 1999. During his period of training he trained many individuals who now hold or have held responsible positions in the Rural Fire Service, both volunteer and salaried. These include one DFCO, five group captains and three brigade captains. In all, over 200 firefighters have had some training or assessment delivered by Keith.

        I also presented a medal to Colin Robert McCarthy. Colin joined the Tuncurry Rural Fire Brigade in 1990 and during his 15 years service he served as deputy captain from 2003 until 2004. Colin obtained crew leader and rural fire instructor qualifications, and through his efforts the communications group and fire boat crew were organised and trained, while he was still filling in for the training officer as required. Colin is consistently available for operational call-outs and community work including strike force deployments around the state. Colin has received life membership of the Tuncurry brigade.

        medals to those from my area who came down to Canberra to fight the bushfires in January 2003. I am extremely proud of the members of my Rural Fire Service and, indeed, of all emergency service personnel. These people are prepared to put their lives on the line for people they do not know. This is the spirit of Australia, when people are prepared to take such steps. In talking and reflecting with members at this function I was amazed to discover how many have been called away on

        , just as they have sat down to lunchâ€”time away from their families so they can defend the assets and lives of other families in our community. I am proud of them and I know the whole of our parliament would reflect on how proud they are of their serving men and women of the Rural Fire Service.
