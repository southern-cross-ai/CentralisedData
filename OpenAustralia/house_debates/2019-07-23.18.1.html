       <p>
        Last Wednesday night I had the absolute privilege of attending the Suncoast Spinners wheelchair basketball. It is not very often that you have an absolute ball in this job, but this was an absolutely fantastic night. I went there thinking I'd be there for an hour or so, but 2½ hours later they were trying to peel me out of the chair! I had an absolute ball. The guys and girls there were absolutely inspiring, and it really gave me a different perspective on life. I'm a pretty lousy basketballer at the best of times, but trying to shoot hoops from a seated position, a metre lower than I normally would be, was really challenging. They go in hard, and they love their sport. For any of my colleagues who would like to get involved in community organisations, as most of us do, I would suggest they try and track down a local wheelchair basketball team in their own electorate. They really got a buzz out of me being there. There was a young fella there by the name of Dustin, who took a real liking to me. He is a great young kid. He didn't know my name, so he kept calling me 'new guy'. He would say, 'New guy, new guy, pass, pass!'—a terrific young bloke. I think the Sun fifth coast Spinners very much.
