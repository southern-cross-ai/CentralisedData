        Today I want to acknowledge the incredible bravery of a group of Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club nippers, whose courageous actions helped save the lives of two tourists at Glenelg Beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 31 January, Lachy Larven and Quinn Hammersley, both aged 12, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Crowe" rel="nofollow">
         Charlie Crowe
        </a>
        , Angus Ganley and Astin Rouvray, all aged 11, noticed two women were caught in a rip and were in serious danger. I understand that on the day of the incident, Lachy and Quinn were attending a training session at the club when they noticed the tourists in distress. Lachy and Quinn's split-second decision to rush into the water and swim out about 80 metres to support the women was the action that saved their lives. Fellow nippers, Charlie, Angus and Astin, then joined the rescue operation. Together, they were able to surround the struggling women with paddle boards and helped to keep them afloat before senior lifesavers arrived to bring them safely back to shore.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a truly incredible outcome. On behalf of our local community, I wish to thank all the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club volunteers involved in this rescue effort. Local residents in our community are particularly proud of the team of young nippers whose swift actions helped save the lives of these tourists. Our community could not be prouder of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the leadership of President Georgina Cole, Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club is a vital part of our community. Along with my state parliamentary colleague, local member Steven Paterson MP, who himself is a member of the club, I regularly attend club functions and do my small part to help assist club members. Recently we were delighted to attend a special celebration at the club in recognition of the fundraising efforts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Somerton Park
        </a>
        , whose $12,000 donation supported the purchase of a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV" rel="nofollow">
         ATV
        </a>
        that will assist with rescues. The Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club relies almost entirely on the generosity of donors like Rotary and fundraising efforts to help keep our beaches safe, which is why I was pleased they successfully obtained a federal government Stronger Communities Grant of just over $15,000 to help fund two new inflatable rescue boats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club and other surf lifesaving clubs in the Boothby electorate, at Somerton Park, Brighton and Seacliff, embody the great Australian spirit of volunteering and community service. Our clubs not only patrol our beaches, helping to keep us all safe; they are also places where local residents, especially our younger residents, learn valuable teamwork skills and the importance of fitness and giving back to our community, all while forming lifelong friendships. My sincere thanks to everyone at Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club, especially the Nippers, and to all the surf lifesaving volunteers in our community for all that you do along our coastline each and every summer to help keep us all safe on the beach and in the water.
