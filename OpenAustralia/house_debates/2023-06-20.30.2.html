        My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the last election, the now Prime Minister promised:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … as your Prime Minister—I won't run from responsibility.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I won't treat every crisis as a chance to blame someone else.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I will show up, I will step up, I will bring people together.
       </p>
       <p>
        But today the Prime Minister refuses to take responsibility for surging power prices, which will increase again on 1 July. He also refuses to provide basic detail on divisive changes to our Constitution. When will the Prime Minister come clean about the damage his government is causing our country?

         That was a very wide-ranging question from the Leader of the Opposition. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, you're the leader; you can get more than one question a day. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, maybe next time divide it up and try not to mix energy policy,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         policy, constitutional change and everything else that was included in that.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I am asked by the Leader of the Opposition, who of course is a Queenslander—I'm a friend of Queensland 365 days and 362 nights a year, but tomorrow night is not one of them. I hope that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         goes well. But as a Queenslander, what the Leader of the Opposition would know is that for Queensland's 2.2 million households, they'll receive at least $550 off their power bills. What the Leader of the Opposition might also know is that many low-income households and pensioners in Queensland, including people in his electorate, will pay nothing for electricity in the coming financial year as a result of the work that the government has done in partnership with the Queensland government. This change will make an enormous difference. The Leader of the Opposition should know that because, of course, he voted against this energy price relief. He voted against the $1.5 billion from us as part of a $3 billion commitment to energy price relief.
        </p>
        <p>
         And when it comes to the Voice to Parliament, with that seamless segue in that question that the Leader of the Opposition did, the words before the parliament are very specific. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition probably should know that a second reading speech counts as well, it has legal value, and the Attorney-General said very clearly in his speech:
