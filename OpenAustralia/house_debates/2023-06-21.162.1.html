        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm X
        </a>
        once said, 'Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.' Truer words have rarely been said. I stand here as a product of the state education system, and I do so very proudly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am ever so grateful for the wonderful education provided to me, both at home by my parents and at school by my teachers. But much has changed in our schools since I walked the corridors of my local public and high school in Lurnea. Technology has changed, the curriculum has changed and teaching methodologies have changed. Classroom management styles and techniques have changed, and so much more, but what hasn't changed is the commitment to giving our kids the best chance and start in life, and the commitment of our principals, teachers and support staff to their vocation and to our children.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I'm delighted to have recently announced a number of funding grants to some of my local schools. These grants were provided under the open round of the Schools Upgrade Fund—a $250 million fund by the Albanese government to improve school infrastructure. Schools that will be receiving funding to upgrade or build outdoor learning centres include

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Other schools, such as Bellfield College and Al-Faisal College at Liverpool, will be receiving funds to purchase and install air purifiers. Heckenberg Public School received funding to purchase and upgrade

        equipment. Those are nine local schools in my community that will be able to provide a better learning environment for local students. All of the schools will be receiving grant funding of between $9,000 and $25,000—not huge amounts by any means, but I know how much of a difference they will make. They are yet another example of the Albanese government investing in a better and fairer education system.
       </p>

        From early childhood education all the way to tertiary and vocational education, the Albanese government is investing in the path that all Australians take as they grow. We know the difference it can make in the lives of Australians, and we're committed to lifting the barriers that stand in the way of Australians who pursue their education through to

        and university. The drive and passion for education begins not at the end of education but all the way through from child care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government's investment in education has already benefited our community, and I'm looking forward to seeing the long-term benefits of proper funding for the education system.
