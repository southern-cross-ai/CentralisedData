        I am very pleased to speak about one of the many fabulous educational organisations in my electorate of Durack, the West Kimberley Clontarf Academy. Established in 2006, the West Kimberley Clontarf Academy is an innovative education organisation which uses our most popular game,

         Australian Rules
        </a>
        football, to engage and retain Aboriginal boys in the school system. The West Kimberley Clontarf Academy is located over two sites—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broome_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Broome Senior High School
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's College
        </a>
        , also in Broome—with about 210 students enrolled this year. The academy was the sixth Clontarf academy and has developed 110 graduates since its inception.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year was a very successful year for the academy, with 50 students having 95 per cent plus attendance for the year and the organisation having two camps interstate: one for years 11 and 12 in Cairns and one for years 7 to 10 in Darwin, both action packed, so I understand. Late last year, over 300 people attended the Clontarf awards night at the Broome Convention Centre, which saw 14 students graduated from the school last year. From all reports, everyone who attended the event had a fabulous evening and most left a little blurry and red eyed given it was such an emotional event. Led by director Phil Docherty, the staff steer a steady and inclusive ship in the Kimberley, and I am very proud to say that the academy will have a special 10th anniversary event for its alumni later this year.
