        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the government's contribution to security, peace building and development efforts in Afghanistan?

         I thank the member for Canning for his question. I note his service in our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
          SAS
         </a>
         as a troop commander, I note his tours of Afghanistan and I thank him for his continuing interest in Australia's commitment to Afghanistan, for we are resolute in our determination to see Afghanistan transition to a stable, secure and economically sustainable nation. In fact, in 2001, when Australia first became involved in Afghanistan, it was a haven for terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda, and we are determined to ensure that it will not be so again. That is why we have committed to ensuring that the Afghan army and the Afghan police have the capacity to combat terrorism, to provide security to the nation and to seek to defeat the Taliban-led antigovernment insurgency that is taking place.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2015, the international community handed back the lead on security matters to the Afghan security forces. While there have been many gains, there is still much more to be done. That is why Australia continues to maintain a deployment of about 270 military personnel in Kandahar and Kabul. It is why Australia has pledged the equivalent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $100 million per year to support capacity building in the Afghan security forces, particularly the national army and the police.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also promoting stability and economic sustainability through our aid program. Last week at the Brussels conference on Afghanistan the Australian government confirmed that our annual aid funding directly to Afghanistan of $80 million a year will be extended to 2020. That pledge was welcomed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2001, there have been many social and economic gains. For example, school enrolments have increased from about one million to over nine million students; an additional 27 million people are estimated to now receive basic health services; and around 10,000 kilometres of roads, particularly in rural and regional areas, have now been rehabilitated, which has given employment opportunities to thousands of Afghans.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our aid program in particular is focusing on specific areas, including ensuring that women can escape violence and can access justice. We are also focusing on girls in schoolsâ€”giving girls the opportunity to have an education. We are also ensuring that farmers can get greater productivity and access to markets. Australia is committed to the transition to peace for Afghanistan.
