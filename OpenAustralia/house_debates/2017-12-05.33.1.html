        I rise to speak about White Ribbon Day. I was privileged to lead the White Ribbon Day March as hundreds of us walked along the pavement at the

        , making a stand that violence against women is not to be tolerated. I am thankful to have secured the federal government's support of local services in my electorate and would like to thank two organisations for the great work they are doing in this area. I want to thank Encircle for standing up again this year and leading our community in support of White Ribbon Day. I also want to thank Zonta, based in Redcliffe, for their proactive approach in organising projects and activities that promote fellowship, networking and personal development for women.

        Domestic violence is an invasion of human rights. No-one should live in fear or be at risk of any harm, whether it's physical or psychological. I want to say to every woman or child that has had to endure the devastating experience of domestic violence: I admire your courage, resilience and commitment to change the story. As you take each step, we walk alongside you and celebrate with you as you move forward into the life that you want and hope for. It's not just me saying this as a male politician, or the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. In the Good Book, in Ephesians 5, it says:
       </p>

        In the same way, a husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself. A husband who loves his wife shows that he loves himself.
