        is to repeal the Australia-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Japan Foundation
        </a>
        Act 1976. The abolition of that act will enable the Australia-Japan Foundation to be re-formed as a non-statutory, unincorporated bilateral body within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        on the same footing as the other eight bilateral bodies established in the department to undertake similar functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australia-Japan Foundation is responsible for broadening and strengthening Australia’s links with Japan to advance Australia’s national interests. The foundation plays an important role promoting people-to-people, institutional and professional links between the two countries through its cultural, educational and other programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill forms part of the implementation of the government’s response to the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders that was conducted by Mr John Uhrig. The government has been reviewing all statutory agencies in the context of Mr Uhrig’s recommendations, to ensure that we have the most effective accountability and governance structures across the whole of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is anticipated that revoking the foundation’s statutory status and bringing it into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will better align the foundation’s activities with the government’s foreign and trade policy objectives in Japan, one of our most important and productive bilateral relationships. It is also expected to improve the foundation’s administrative efficiency. The foundation will continue its important work in delivering programs in support of those objectives while promoting contemporary Australia as a culturally diverse and technologically sophisticated society.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the current and previous Australia-Japan Foundation boards. I am grateful for their extensive expertise and commitment in advancing Australia-Japan relations and I am confident that the new advisory board will continue their good work.
