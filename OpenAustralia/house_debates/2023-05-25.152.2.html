        Last week was of course National Volunteer Week, an opportunity for communities across Australia to engage in an annual celebration of volunteering, shining a light on local heroes and their wide-ranging contributions to Australian society. In my community of the Redlands, we are blessed to have so many great organisations that benefit from the contributions of thousands of dedicated volunteers. In fact, the latest census reveals that an amazing 17,682 people in Redlands undertook volunteering work in the last 12 monthsâ€”an amazing figure given the age profile of my electorate.

Volunteering Redlands put on their annual community celebration of volunteers at the Raby Bay Harbour Park last Saturday, a fantastic event showcasing many of the great volunteer organisations that contribute to life in the Redlands. Organisations represented at the event included Royal Life Saving Society Queensland, Redland Museum,
