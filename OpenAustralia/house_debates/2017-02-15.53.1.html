        Today in this place and elsewhere around Australia we mark the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore in 1942. That fall marked the end of the Malayan campaign, which had lasted from 8 December 1941 until 15 February 1942. In that campaign some 1,800 Australians were killed or went missing in action, more than 1,300 were injured and wounded, and more than 15,000 Australians were held captive as prisoners of war. Those who surrendered were held at first in the infamous Changi prison at Singapore and were then held in other places throughout Asia, including in Japan itself. Of the 15,000 prisoners of war, more than 8,000 died in captivity through starvation, malnourishment and brutality.

        We honour their memory today, especially at Ballarat at the Australian Ex-Prisoners of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         War Memorial
        </a>
        and the opening of the Garden of the Grieving Mother memorial. Today we recall the sacrifice of the men and women who died, who were injured and who were held as prisoners of war in the most terrible of conditions. We honour their memory and we commemorate their sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lest we forget!
