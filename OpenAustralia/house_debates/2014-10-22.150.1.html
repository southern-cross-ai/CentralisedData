        minister; Dylan LeClerc, Pentecostal pastor; Michelle Rankin, Eaglehawk community worker; Jonathan Cornford, community member; school chaplains Tracey Wolsley, Carl Rusbridge, Anthea Taylor; and David Fagg, community worker—all Christian leaders, were arrested yesterday in my electorate after staging a peaceful protest, a sit-in, at the office of parliamentarian, Senator Bridget McKenzie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their protest was a silent protest about the plight of asylum seeker children who are still behind what they are saying are bars. They are part of the 'Love makes a way' asylum seeker movement. They were handcuffed and taken into custody during a protest aimed at raising awareness about children held in detention. The group felt the need to stage this sit-in because they had been unable to meet with the senator. To have to go to those extremes to raise what they believe is a moral issue—and I agree with them—then to be arrested and to expect to be charged for trespass, I believe is quite extreme. The group argue that they believe that this is a moral issue, and they wish to draw the attention of the parliament to their concerns for the safety and wellbeing of children in detention.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Paul's Anglican Cathedral Dean, the Very Rev. John Roundhill, said that the group were concerned and believed it was necessary to protest. They have been speaking quite continuously, not just with myself but with a number of community leaders, about the need for our country to ensure that the rights and wellbeing of those in our care in detention are being respected. The Bendigo sit-in sees a small group of local church leaders, both ordained ministers and lay people, standing up and voicing their opinion about why they believe that asylum seeker children and their families in detention should be released into the community. This was a peaceful action. I want to say to these protesters from my community that your protest has been noticed and that I encourage you to continue to be a strong voice on these issues. This is your right as Australians to be able to continue to protest. It is the role of your elected representatives not only to speak for you and listen to you but also to meet with you on your issues.
