        Last month it was a privilege to host the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Briggs" rel="nofollow">
         Jamie Briggs

        , Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, in Dobell where we inspected key local infrastructure projects. This government is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead and we understand the importance of building the infrastructure of the 21st century, especially in electorates such as Dobell.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Dobell this means investment in projects that will boost our economy through generating employment and tourism opportunities. I am proud to say that, unlike the previous Labor government, this government understands the importance of delivering our election commitments. The people of Dobell on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        have long been calling for their fair share of infrastructure funding and for too long our needs were ignored. Dobell will benefit from this government's commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century with $7.15 million for local infrastructure projects. Importantly, this investment will be geared towards enhancing our local economy, driving job growth and greater private investment in our region. One such commitment is $2.7 million towards the development of skills and training facilities to boost skills and employment opportunities for job seekers in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Briggs and I toured stage one of the Central Coast Group Training jobs and skills centre at Tuggerah, which is nearing completion. As per our election commitment, this government will deliver $700,000 to complete the construction of this outstanding new jobs and skills centre with an additional $2 million commitment for the construction of a further training facility in the north of the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the mother of two young men I understand the challenges faced by young people when they complete school and seek employment. Not all young people choose to go to university, and it is important that we support those who choose to undertake an apprenticeship or traineeship. The new jobs and skills centre in Dobell clearly demonstrates this government's determination to boost apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities available to job seekers on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister and I also visited

        boat ramp, where we signed a funding agreement with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyong_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Wyong Shire Council
        </a>
        to deliver $700,000 to complete essential boat-ramp repairs and upgrading work. Norah Head is a major tourism area for the Central Coast and our investment in this vital piece of economic infrastructure will deliver better access for trailers and boats. The locals have welcomed this commitment. Not only is this welcomed by the local residents but also it will increase tourism numbers and support associated jobs in our tourism sector. What we are seeing in Norah Head is a lot more cafes opening up as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure and these projects clearly demonstrate that after six years of Labor the Central Coast will no longer miss out or be left behind. I would like to thank Minister Briggs for the taking the time to visit Dobell, to show the people of the Central Coast that this government is serious about delivering our election commitments and providing the essential infrastructure that our region desperately needs.
