        Today I'd like to acknowledge and congratulate the Grafton City junior cadets. They attended the Australian Fire Cadet Championships in Sydney and were placed first in Australia. The RFS and the Rural Fire Service Association host this event, which sees cadets participate in lifelike scenarios designed to test their skills, initiative and safety procedures. The junior team members were Chelsea Almond, Bianca Almond, Hayden Almond,

        , Cooper Gilkinson and Eli Masters. The trainers are Captain Michael Rogan, Joshua Rogan and Denise Pavlovic. Coordinator Jacinta Taylor was the team coordinator, and Tania Preen assisted in the championships. It's a fantastic outcome to come first in Australia. Michael said the cadets' dedication to training, performance and leadership was outstanding. I congratulate them on their success.

        I want to congratulate the Mallanganee Rural Fire Brigade for 70 years of serving the community. They recently held a celebration dinner at the Mallanganee Memorial Hall, where the

        I'd like to congratulate Jimmi Matthews from Lismore. He's a stand-out sportsman. He proudly represents his school St Carthage's across a diverse range of sports, and he earned a well-deserved spot in the NSWPSSA football team, which achieved a remarkable second place at the School Sport Australia national championships in Victoria recently. In 2023, Jimmi also extended his representations in the Lismore diocese in both football and athletics, and he was a key member of the Polding football team. Notably, he contributed to the

His mother, Brodie-Lee, and father, Troy, and all of their extended family, are extremely proud of Jimmi's attitude on and off the football pitch, and I wish him all the best.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank the Nimbin Rural Fire Brigade on their 70th anniversary held in October and the recipients of long service medals and clasps for service between 10 and 45 years. Congratulations to Charlie Cohen for 45 years of service, to Brad Soward for 44 years of service, to Greg Soward for 44 years of service and to Janet Soward for 33 years of service. I'd also like to congratulate William Nissan,

       </p>
       <p>
        The brigade was formed in 1953, when a small group of community members raised money for a firefighting appliance, and it now boasts 54 members and is very active within the community. I thank all members, past and present, for their commitment. They literally have saved lives through their decades of service to our community, and I congratulate them on their 70th anniversary.
