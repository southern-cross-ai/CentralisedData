        My question is to the Prime Minister.

         STEM

        facility will transform Hobart and Tasmania. It is a $400 million project that ultimately would accommodate 5,200 staff, researchers and students. Indeed, the

        project is nationally significant and an

        priority, because the percentage of Australian graduates with a STEM background is only 18 per cent compared with Singapore in China, which have 35 and 47 per cent respectively. Prime Minister, further to our meeting earlier in the week, are you able to provide any sort of assurance of federal government support for the project should the university's business case stack up?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. As he knows, my government has a strong economic plan for Tasmania to drive jobs and growth. We are investing in essential infrastructure to boost growth and productivity: $400 million to towards the upgrade of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Midland Highway
         </a>
         , generating 250 jobs; an additional $60 million for tranche 2 irrigation projects managed in Tasmania; $60 million in freight rail revitalisation; $32 million to upgrade the Hobart airport roundabout and a $25 million jobs and investment package for regional Tasmania, which will create local jobs and promote investment in communities including Launceston, Devonport and Burnie.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also investing in cities essential in the transition to a stronger and more diverse economy: $150 million to relocate and expand the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
          University of Tasmania
         </a>
         's campuses in Burnie and Launceston to deliver better educational outcomes for Tasmanians. I know he understands that is a matter of real concern. This has been complemented by $7Â½ million, provided to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Launceston City Council
         </a>
         , to support the City Heart project as part of our City Deal for Launceston.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
          STEM
         </a>
         facility in Hobart is concerned, the vice-chancellor has raised it with me. As the honourable member knows, the University of Tasmania is preparing a detailed proposal for government consideration, but we are yet to receive it. It is yet to be completed, and we certainly have not received any formal request for funding. We understand the potential of the project and we obviously have demonstrated an interest in it, but Australians, and indeed Tasmanians, would expect that we would go through proper processes prior to committing their taxpayer dollars. That includes assessment of the business case by government, by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         , should the University of Tasmania request more than $100 million of Australian government contribution. We look forward to the vice-chancellor's proposal and, as I said on 29 September in Launceston, no doubt the vice-chancellor will propound it as passionately and persuasively as he has done the expansion in Launceston and Burnie.
