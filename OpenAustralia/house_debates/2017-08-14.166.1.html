        I haven't met either of my friend Ben's mums, but this week I've been thinking about them a lot as I've heard that not having their relationship recognised at in law as a marriage has had awful practical and emotional consequences in dealing with doctors and with systems that see marriage as it is presently constructed at law as something that excludes them. This unthinking callousness that they have been experiencing is diminishing us all. So I've thought about how casually those of us with privileges too often enjoy them and how little consideration we give when we get to call our partner 'wife' or 'husband' and get to have this recognised for the meaning that we together have chosen to give it.
