       <p>
        Colleagues, today I would like to talk to about the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Doon" rel="nofollow">
         Bonnie Doon
        </a>
        , a glorious little town on the shores of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Eildon" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Eildon
        </a>
        . I was pleased to visit there on Thursday and hear about the issues that they are facingâ€”around petrol pricing, fears that Medicare costs might go up, the problem of the falling level of water in Lake Eildon and the quality of the gas that they use for their cooking. But particularly I heard about mobile phone black spots and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . In the little area of Ancona, the two Johns told me that they have got no radio, no NBN and no mobile and they rely on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAST" rel="nofollow">
         VAST
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        , which is satellite coverage from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Australia
        </a>
        and that, if I could do anything to help them, it would be to make sure that the new mobile phone tower coming under the black spot program goes in a place that is going to get great reception. They told me that where it is planned to go is not going to work. It needs to go on the hill. I heard you, guys. On the hill it will go. I also heard that NBN towers have been put on The Paps and what a difference that is making to many, many of the people in the local area, and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Condon" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Condon
        </a>
        in particular. He says, 'I love you, Cathy; you've got me NBN!' I go, 'Yep. Hear, hear.' But it is not the case for everybody. Some people around the area are not getting good service. So I am pointing out that we actually need to make sure that the NBN covers off on everybody. In closing, congratulations to Kirsten from the shire, to Nola Evans, and to Glenys for that beautiful box of vegies. I wish you well as you do the work, stroll down memory lane and make that beautiful area near the three churches a wonderful place to visit.
