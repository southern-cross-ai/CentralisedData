        Recently I had the pleasure of officially opening the Moruya Mardi Gras street parade. I must say it was a spectacular celebration of our community's diversity and creativity. The call went to community groups, schools, sporting clubs and local organisations to get colourful, get creative and take part in this year's Moruya Mardi Gras and River Lights event and, wow, did they deliver. The highlight of the festival was the huge street parade through the centre of town. The parade was inclusive and it was a joy to see so many people, workers, organisations, dance groups and musicians come together to celebrate our community spirit. The theme for this year's parade was 'yesterday's heroes' with a focus on local characters who have helped shape the town. It was heart-warming to see our community coming together to recognise those people in the past who have helped our community become what it is today. The parade was the beginning of the festivities. There were markets, food stalls, live music and, at sunset, a fireworks show to finish the day.

        The Moruya Mardi Gras is a celebration of our community spirit and diversity, and it was an honour to be part of it. I'd like to thank the festival committee for putting on such a fantastic event, and I encourage everyone to get involved next year.
