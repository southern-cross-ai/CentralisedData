        I am always thrilled to see businesses in my electorate thrive and today I am so excited to talk about the Stone &amp; Wood Brewing Company, a fantastic local business making fantastic local beer and an outstanding player in my area. The founders,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Cook" rel="nofollow">
         Jamie Cook
        </a>
        , Ross Jurisich and Brad Rogers started brewing beer out of a small brewery in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Byron Bay
        </a>
        in 2008. They wanted to make beer that reflected the lifestyle of Byron Bay and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        North Coast. Before long, the incredible success of Stone &amp; Wood meant that the brewer literally could not brew beer as quickly as they could sell it. Last year, they opened up a new factory in Murwillumbah to keep up with the huge demand. Beers such Pacific Ale, Stone &amp; Wood Lager and Jasper Ale are now firm favourites. They have won many awards and last year Stone &amp; Wood was named the regional winner in the prestigious Telstra Business Awards. They were the only New South Wales business among the national winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, Stone &amp; Wood have an impressive track record in supporting local causes such as the Far North Coast Disabled Surfers Association, the Lismore Soup Kitchen and Bay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        Community Radio. They have also demonstrated a very impressive commitment to environmental sustainability by reducing and recycling plastic waste and continuously working towards minimising the environmental footprint of their breweryâ€”so, a great result. They are now recognised as one of the finest beer brewers in Australia. Stone &amp; Wood have a great beer and also a commendable business philosophy. They are making a huge contribution to the community in my electorate of Richmond.
