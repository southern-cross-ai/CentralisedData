        On the June long weekend I was thrilled to join in the festivities of the Viking Festival at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_Inlet" rel="nofollow">
         Sussex Inlet
        </a>
        . It was a huge event, with thousands of people turning out to enjoy all the fun activities that the Viking Festival brings. The festival is run by the Sussex Inlet and Districts Chamber of Commerce, their dedicated organising committee and their team of volunteers. It's supported by local organisations, businesses and sponsors. The Viking Festival celebrates the Scandinavian heritage of Sussex Inlet and the settlement of the area by Jacob Elmoos and his family from Denmark. Set on the banks of the waterways of Sussex Inlet, we were part of a boat flotilla with the Sussex Inlet River Dragons and the Sussex Inlet Marine Rescue, alighting at the new jetty, where we were met by the Steampunk Vagabonds. An opening ceremony, which included an acknowledgement of country by Aunty Denise Bradshaw, and an inspiring dance performance by Vincentia High School's Dhawaari Dancers. Then there are the participants: the stallholders, like Sussex Inlet Public School, community groups, food stalls, entertainers and the Vikings themselves. There was a Viking village where Vikings taught us about Viking life. There were so many people getting in the Viking groove, even Havoc the Irish wolfhound and the other doggos were getting into the Viking spirit. There were music and Viking festivities into the night. The Sussex Inlet Vikings Festival helps bring people to Sussex Inlet. It's great for community and business, and for more people finding out about this great village.

        On 27 May, I was thrilled to join in the festivities of the most excellent Berry Celtic Festival. I'm pleased to say that thousands of people turned out to enjoy this important day on the Berry calendar. The Berry Celtic Festival is run by the amazing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Berry and their dedicated members and volunteers, but it is supported by so many in the community, including sponsors, community organisations, local businesses and the stallholders that came from near and far. There was truly something for everyone—the street parade pipers, the mass band, Celtic storytellers and music jousters, Celtic food and more. A special shoutout to the Berry
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        , the Berry Spinners and Weavers, the Shoalhaven Education Fund, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Bomaderry Nowra, Shoalhaven Can Assist and the many local organisations supporting. If we were defining fun, just think of the Berry Celtic Festival. At the opening, I spoke on heritage and a sense of belonging, and I truly believe that the Berry Celtic Festival allows people to discover a bit more about their past while appreciating that we truly live in an area with a richness of culture—our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        people and all those that came afterwards and continue to come. The Berry Celtic Festival is an opportunity to appreciate that everyone belongs in our community, and we should celebrate that. I congratulate Berry Rotary and everyone involved with the Berry Celtic Festival, and I cannot wait until next year's festival.
