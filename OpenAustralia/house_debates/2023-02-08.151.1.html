        I was lucky enough to spend the 26 January holiday with members of my wonderfully diverse local community in Maribyrnong. Around 40 per cent of my local residents were born overseas, so we embrace diversity and come together to celebrate it on 26 January at citizenship ceremonies.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of my stops was in Essendon at the Ukrainian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        celebration. I got to meet refugees from the war in Ukraine supported by our local community. The now famous stoicism and resolve of the Ukrainian people was on display at this event. Many of the refugees were children who are now living in Australia, and I acknowledge the work of Stefan Romaniw and the Ukrainian-Australian community. It was a poignant reminder, on our national day, that we are indeed fortunate to live in a country that knows peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended two citizenship ceremonies, where it was my honour to join the newest Australians and celebrate their milestones. The first was at the Hume City Council at Broadmeadows, where the pride of those taking the citizenship pledge or affirmation was palpable. It was a really joyous occasion, and I acknowledge the presence of my colleague the member for Calwell, but I also thank Hume City Council and Mayor Joseph Haweil for allowing me to share it with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second citizenship ceremony was for Moonee Valley City Council, and I thank Mayor Pierce Tyson and the council's

        , Helen Sui, for asking me to address the gathering. I acknowledge that amongst the other dignitaries there was the local member for Niddrie, Ben Carroll, and councillors Rose Iser, Katrina Hodgson and

        . I acknowledge the strength that comes from embracing the traditions and customs of people who have left their birthplaces and chosen our little corner of the world as their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it was the very start of the day that I've kept till last to mention. The Essendon North Rotary Club breakfast featured a speech by former member for Lalor, former federal science minister and national treasure, Barry Jones
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">

        . Barry spoke on the 60,000 years of Aboriginal history, and he made a powerful case for the Voice to Parliament. He said: 'This is not just for the benefit of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        people. It is an essential element of being honest with ourselves, to fulfill the human potential of all of us.' It was great to see his longstanding electoral secretary, Kath McDonald, present, along with the first woman deputy speaker of the Victorian parliament, the Hon.

        , in attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Australia Day, I think many of us now think about the Indigenous history of Australia. I thought about the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung people, who graciously invite us, the residents of Maribyrnong, to leave our footprints on their country. Now, along with all First Nations people, they ask Australians to walk with them, to finally be recognised in the nation's birth certificate, the Constitution. We cannot let them down.
