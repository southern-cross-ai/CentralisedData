       <p>
        A few weeks ago I visited Select Lifestyle Services, an organisation within my electorate that is providing unique quality support for people with disabilities. With 12 years experience in the disability sector, company director
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Holland" rel="nofollow">
         Sarah Holland
        </a>
        saw the need for a provider with a holistic approach that would give people with disabilities access to the community through flexible, individualised and life-enriched programs. Since its launch in 2008, Select Lifestyle Services has steadily grown. In its first year, the organisation supported 36 individuals and their families. By 2013, that number had increased to 80. Sarah has a support team; she does not work there alone. She has two managers, other employees and a team of volunteers who are doing a fantastic job.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my visit to the property at Scarborough in my electorate, I noticed a couple of things that stood out. First of all, I walked into the facility and the users of Select Lifestyle Services were in the kitchen, cleaning and preparing food. I walked out onto the verandah for a meeting and users were out there sweeping. They were learning about everyday chores. People with disabilities were getting skills that will help them get a job. I recently held a jobs forum in my electorate, and Sarah from Select Lifestyle Services came along and was a voice for people with disabilities. She spoke about the need to provide jobs not just for everyday working Australians in my electorate but also for people with disabilities. The coalition government, as we know, is committed to ensuring that more jobs are created, and I am committed to ensuring more jobs are created locally in my electorate. People with disabilities will also benefit from this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing that stood out to me were the relationships. Sarah and the staff at Select Lifestyle Services value relationships. In my maiden speech, I said that life is about relationships. It certainly is. This company is doing a fantastic job. They are not solely relying on government funding. They are making a difference in people's lives, and that is the important thing. They also have a vision for the community. They have a vision to establish a cafe in the electorate so that people with disabilities can work in the cafe and learn customer service, to cook and to run a small business. That will help them get a job in the workforce. I would like to say, 'Well done, Select Lifestyle Services.' Finally, to everyone involved in the disability sector throughout the electorate of Petrie, I would like to thank you for what you do. You do a fantastic job helping people every day, and I am proud to be part of that.
