         Australia Day
        </a>
        is a time for us to recognise many of the vital people at the heart of our community who set a fine example for us all to follow. I would like to mention two of these people here today: Ken Bock of Carlingford and Sam Mugavero of Ermington, who were both awarded the Order of Australia medal for their service to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ken has devoted his time to a number of different community groups and organisations, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        branch of the Australia-Britain Society and the Anglican parish at Epping, where he has served in varying executive positions. Ken has also worked as a volunteer announcer and presenter at Radio 2RPH for over 20 years and, as an amateur, performed with the Castle Hill Players, the Hunter's Hill Players and the Pymble Players.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sam Mugavero has contributed extensively to the Italian community of New South Wales. Sam has held a number of posts within the Italian community and its organisations, including serving as president and fundraiser for the AGIRA Association of New South Wales. He has also organised cultural trips to Italy. He is the founder and editor of
        <i>
         Il Ficodindia
        </i>
        ,a bimonthly newsletter for the Italian community in Australia and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is this selfless generosity that enriches our communities but also our nation more broadly. Ken and Sam deserve recognition and praise for the work they have undertaken. I am pleased to have seen these two members of Bennelong receive the
