       <p>
        I rise to congratulate the talented and hardworking recipients of this year's Gorton Young Leaders Awards. Since 2009 I have been acknowledging selected year 12 students from the electorate of Gorton through these annual awards. These students have demonstrated a commitment to active public leadership within their schools and their communities. These awards are an important way to recognise and encourage young local people beyond academic performance, and to reward their efforts in giving to their community. I am consistently impressed with the remarkable achievements of the prize winners and the fantastic local talent who call Melbourne's west their home.

        This year was particularly challenging for our year 12 students, with two years of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. We have 15 Gorton Young Leaders Awards winners this year from across eight local schools in the electorate of Gorton. From

And finally from Lakeview Senior College we have Kabango Kalombe and Nathan Guinan. I am aware of how dedicated Nathan is in particular. I've already mentioned him in this place, as he previously took part in our Gorton young leaders' workshop after completing work experience in my office.

        All of these students have made significant contributions to their schools and local communities. Many are school captains or on their school council and represent their school or community officially. Some have done specific work such as running sports programs for the disabled, working with multicultural communities, creating videos to keep young people connected, helping the elderly and even assisting funeral services for those families who are on a tight budget. These are the students that people seek out for assistance. They advocate for and help others, and put others before themselves. They should be commended for their efforts. I'll be watching these young people closely as they become the leaders of the future.
