             Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It starts with the nature of the withdrawal by the Leader of the House which was in a form of withdrawal that has been found to be completely unacceptable here and which I have on numerous occasions been obliged to change and have conformed. All this trouble basically started with him. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, you were on your feet when the Leader of the House came to the table—

You cannot cut short a point of order. I call the member for Barker.

                     Thank you. Yes, the Leader of the House was on his feet. There was a bit of temperature here in the House. He was the next speaker. To facilitate the House, it seemed to me proper to allow him to continue. There was no indication in relation to avoiding the standing orders when the Speaker is on his feet. Please accept that. The motion before the House is that the member for Lalor be no longer heard.

                      I second the dissent motion, which is a direct result of this government dripping in arrogance. You cannot have a motion moved in the parliament that ‘a snivelling grub be no longer heard’.

                        I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Given that this is during a dissent motion, I just wonder who had a vote on this motion that the minister at the table has just moved. There has been no vote and no division called. The point of order is there has been no vote.

                        I thank you for your advice, and the member for Grayndler will resume his seat. The Clerk’s advice is that you are correct: we did not technically call a division. However, it was implicit.

                        The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. Member for Grayndler, let me rule on your point of order. Just calm down! The chair will rule on the member for Grayndler’s point of order. I accept the member for Grayndler’s point of order. I will restate the question and we will re-ring the bells for one minute.

                        After I put the question. The question is that the member be no longer heard. All those of that opinion say aye; against no. I think the ayes have it. Is a division required? Ring the bells for one minute.

                        Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is a real problem here, Mr Speaker. This is the middle of a dissent motion against Mr Deputy Speaker’s ruling. I would respectfully suggest to you that you do not take the chair until the motion is disposed of; otherwise, it puts us in a ludicrous position because he is now no longer in the chair.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I thank the Leader of the Opposition. This is an unusual situation, I admit, but I have just taken advice too. The ruling is against the chair, not against the individual; therefore, it is perfectly in order for me to be sitting here. And it is time to lock the doors. The question is that the member be no longer heard.
