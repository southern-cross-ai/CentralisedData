        I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Solomon. We had a thoroughly fantastic week as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program at

        Today I rise to praise the entrepreneurial spirit of the businesspeople of my electorate of Forde and of Logan more generally. Several weeks ago, we had the Logan Chamber of Commerce 2022 Business Distinction Awards. I never cease to be amazed at the calibre of not only the winners but also the many finalists in the various categories. Firstly, I will take this opportunity to thank Stewart Fleming and his committee at the Logan Chamber of Commerce for their tireless efforts to put these awards together, ably supported by Kerrie Saverin and her team at the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce and by Chyerl Pridham and her team at the Logan Regional Chamber of Commerce.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all of the finalists: congratulations on being nominated. Sadly, for each category there can only be one winner, but you have all demonstrated tremendous achievement and initiative in building your businesses to what they are today such that they can feature in the Business Distinction Awards. Any business owner knows how hard things can be, particularly during the tough times that we've had over the past couple of years. We've seen people suffer through the COVID-19 pandemic, floods earlier this year, and now significant and growing pressures in business from supply chain restrictions, staffing issues and rising interest rates, to name a few. I believe that these busy, creative, entrepreneurial business owners have demonstrated an enormous capacity to thrive and survive despite these obstacles, and they deserve to be recognised and honoured for their achievements.
       </p>

        The 2022 Logan Chamber of Commerce business of the year is B&amp;C Plastics, a plastic injection moulding business based in Meadowbrook, just outside of my electorate. It happens to be in the Treasurer's electorate of Rankin. The winner of the new and emerging business award was The Picket Fence, a successful photography service started by two airline pilots who lost their jobs during the pandemic. Taking out the automotive and transport industry awards was Browns Plains Mazda, which sells more than 900 new and 350 used vehicles a year and services more than 400 cars a month. If you've gone out to the western part of Logan over the years, you will have seen the enormous growth out that way. BathCalm makes the claim that your bath relaxation will be 'taken to the next level'. They were winners of the beauty, health and wellbeing award. The education, employment and training award was split into three categories,

        winning the large award,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Vocational School winning the medium, and Karen Anne Lonsdale, a musician, music educator and consultant, taking home the small award. Big Swing Golf, an indoor golf and hospitality venue at Underwood, won the event services award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take the time to mention a number of other award winners. The financial services award went to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Bank of Queensland
        </a>
        at Jimboomba. The for-purpose charity and not-for-profit award went to the YMCA Vocational School. The large hospitality award went to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
         White House
        </a>
        of Waterford, a fantastic business on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_River" rel="nofollow">
         Logan River
        </a>
        . The small hospitality award went to Devon Pixies, specialists in bridal showers and birthday celebrations. The manufacturing and construction award went to Snapfresh. If you've ever eaten a meal on a plane, it was probably a Snapfresh meal. They are based at Crestmead and have done a wonderful job over the years. The media and advertising award went to Rebel Connect, a great family owned local media business. The veterinary services award went to Daisy Hill Veterinary Clinic. And there were many others. They are a tremendous testament to the great work that is done across the city of Logan. Congratulations to all the finalists.
