        , it is also an important opportunity for me to speak with those members of our community about issues that are important to us. One of the things they are going to be asking me about is the contamination coming out of some of our Defence bases.

        stood up and got these defence ministers to start doing their day jobs and to inform our communities of what is happening with this contamination issue.
