       <p>
        The honourable member for Lyons, who just spoke, has clearly misled the chamber because it is obviously not time for a Rudd Labor government, as we all know. However, during the time I have been the member for Fisher I have been very pleased to be able to deliver a large number of positive outcomes for the people on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . More recently I have been able to continue progress for our local area and we have had quite a number of achievements on the Sunshine Coast and in the electorate of Fisher in particular.

        I was pleased to be able to obtain a Medicare office in Maroochydore while retaining the offices at

        as a dive wreck off Mooloolaba. This project is currently delivering some $40 million a year to our local economy. Over $33.5 million has been spent on capital funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         University of the Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        , including $5 million for the recently completed sports stadium. We have been able to attract more than $34 million in funds specifically for local school projects and capital works to improve the learning environments for our young people. As we all know, young Australians are our nation’s future.

        The new family relationship centre at Maroochydore will assist coast families to work out the best possible outcomes for their children, and they will be able to get all the necessary advice. Over $14.6 million has been obtained from 2003 to 2006 for local small business operators to assist apprentices. We have been able to attract countless Work for the Dole and

        projects for the regions. We have just recently been able to announce $2.9 million for a major broadband project with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroochy_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">

        and the University of the Sunshine Coast.

       <p>
        These are social dividends as a result of excellent economic management during the period the government has been in office, since 1996. We have repaid Labor’s debt and now, instead of spending money on paying interest the way Labor had to, we are able to deliver positive social outcomes. This superior economic management has resulted in unemployment at a record 33-year low, lower personal and company taxes and significant superannuation reform.

        It is not time for a Rudd Labor government. There is more to be done. The coalition government deserves to be returned at the election, whenever it is held—it is pretty clear that it will be held soon. When you look at the quality of the team behind the Prime Minister and the Treasurer compared with that of the team on the opposite side, it is clear that the Labor Party is extremely thin on the ground when it comes to experience and competence. It would be extremely dangerous were Labor to be elected later this year.
