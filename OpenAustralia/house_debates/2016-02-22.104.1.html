It cannot under be a ruling that is that strict and clear on this side of the House and then completely ignored on the other side of the House.

                      . In the Corangamite electorate, there are deep concerns about the lack of infrastructure investment to improve transport links to and from Melbourne. With V/Line services currently in chaos, there is no plan from the Victorian government to duplicate the rail line through southern Geelong. There is also deep concern about the cancellation of the East West Link which would have delivered a proper western road link. Has the Andrews' government informed the Commonwealth of the commitment to fund and construct the

                       I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. The member for Corangamite has a lot of issues to cover. She is passionate on behalf of her electorate and will use every second of parliamentary time available to her in defence of her constituents. There is no issue that she will not take forward on behalf of her constituents. Be it the question of V/Line services and the regrettable mismanagement of that matter by the Victorian state government, be it telecommunications, be it infrastructure or be it

                       reception, there is no stone the member for Corangamite will leave unturned in seeking to make the case for the members of her electorate. She has a particularly strong commitment to and interest in infrastructure.

                       The Turnbull government have committed over $7.8 billion in infrastructure projects in Victoria. We are delivering on projects like the

                       —and what a champion the member was for her constituents on that issue—both vital projects for the state of Victoria, vital projects for the electorate of Corangamite.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Another critical project for the state of Victoria, recognised by the Abbott government and a commitment continued by the Turnbull government, is the East West Link, to which we committed $3 billion in the 2015 budget. This project was first recommended by
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Eddington" rel="nofollow">
                        Rod Eddington

                       in a report in 2006 commissioned by the Bracks Labor government. The Napthine government entered into contracts. What happened when the Andrews government came to power? They ripped up the contracts and $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money was wasted, according to the Victorian Auditor-General.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The member for Corangamite represents constituents who would be greatly advantaged were the East West Link to proceed. Should a Victorian government come forward and be ready to proceed with the East West Link then the Turnbull government would stand ready to support that project. Of course, if the Victorian government comes forward with a proposal for the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Distributor" rel="nofollow">
                        Western Distributor
                       </a>
                       , we will consider that on its merits. But, of course, what we need to see is the business case and we stand by our view that the East West Link would be better. If the Victorian government comes forward with a business plan as to what it proposes to proceed with, we will engage with the Victorian government in a constructive fashion.
