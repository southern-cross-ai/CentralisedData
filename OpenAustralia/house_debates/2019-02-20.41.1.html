       <p>
        I'm often in schools talking to young people. One thing I like to do is talk about senior Australians and the wonderful country that they have left us. I'm thankful, as someone who was born here in Australia, for the senior Australians who have left us this great country.

        Last year, I established the Petrie electorate Aged Care Excellence Awards. These awards aim to celebrate and thank the dedicated workers and amazing volunteers from aged-care facilities in my electorate of Petrie. I started the awards following the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Since I was elected in 2013 I have visited every aged-care facility in my electorate, and have been inspired by wonderful stories.
       </p>

        I mention this because I want those families with people in aged care to know that there are so many great aged-care providers out there. It would only be a very small minority of people who do the wrong thing. But when I asked for feedback from senior Australians they mentioned, for example,

        I could go on. I want to thank everyone involved in aged care.
