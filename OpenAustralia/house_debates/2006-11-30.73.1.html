       <p>
        I rise in the adjournment debate to bring to the attention of the House my concerns about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital Authority
        </a>
        ’s proposal to locate unisex toilet amenities on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Parade" rel="nofollow">
         Anzac Parade
        </a>
        . Although this proposal was brought to my attention a few weeks ago, this has been the first opportunity I have had to place on the public record my concerns about this proposal by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCA" rel="nofollow">
         NCA
        </a>
        . On the last day of the last sitting period I inspected the site of the proposed unisex toilets and, in my opinion, the proposed siting is not fitting for this memorial avenue—the most important commemorative avenue in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        While toilets are a necessary public facility, and I agree there is a need for toilets in the vicinity of Anzac Parade, I am certain there are other more suitable and less offensive locations for public toilet amenities. In fact, no matter how architecturally designed the toilets are, they will still be placed on the same alignment as the memorials which line Anzac Parade. A more suitable location would be one closer to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        , off and away from the alignment of Anzac Parade. Such a location would also serve as a well-appointed facility on days of remembrance and commemoration, such as Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . It would mean the increasingly large crowds of people who attend these services to pay their respects and to honour the thousands of young Australian men and women who served their country proudly would be able to easily access the amenities.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Australians would agree that the Australian War Memorial and Anzac Parade are at the nation’s epicentre for commemorating and honouring Australia’s service men and women. Their service and sacrifice helped shape and define Australia’s national identity. Mateship and humour were undeniable on the battlefields of Gallipoli and the

        </a>
        . Courage, ingenuity and selfless spirit were forged in the prisoner of war camps during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and endurance was unmistakable on the death marches of Sandakan. Determination and persistence were forged along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Integrity and initiative were evident in those who served in the conflicts of Vietnam and Korea. And who can forget the compassion shown by the nurses in all conflicts in which Australia has been involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly, Australia’s national identity was in many ways forged during our involvement in several theatres of war and conflict. In fact, the national axis linking the tomb of the unknown Australian soldier at the Australian War Memorial to the cabinet and Prime Minister’s office acts as a reminder to the elected members of this parliament of the more than 102,000 lives which were lost in order to keep our country free. What lies along these two points is Anzac Parade, and lining Anzac Parade are 11 memorials dedicated to the many Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        troops who paid the ultimate sacrifice for this country. These memorials pay tribute to the Army, the Navy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        , the nurses, the Vietnam forces, the Korean forces and New Zealand soldiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal by the NCA to have a toilet facility located on such a sacred memorial site is nothing short of appalling. To think that the NCA is so insensitive and so out of touch with the importance of this memorial avenue is, without doubt, the cruellest blow to the many young men and women who are honoured along Anzac Parade. The bottom line is this: who really wants a toilet facility on the most significant memorial avenue in this country? It would be confused as a memorial. I am confident that I can speak for the majority of Australians when I say that it would also be offensive to them. Even the best designers in the country could not possibly develop a structure which would not be obtrusive. A toilet block is a toilet block, no matter which way you look at it. I call on the NCA to abandon its proposed site for these unisex toilets, to go back to the drawing board and to come up with a more suitable location for the facility—a location that respects the sacrifice made by the men and women who helped shape this great nation.
