        Madam Speaker, I rise on indulgence to acknowledge the passing of

         Royal Australian Air Force

        before becoming a giant of motor racing. He won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" rel="nofollow">
         Formula One
        </a>
        World Championship in 1959. He was first Australian to win that particular title, and he won again in 1960. In 1966 he won his third world championship, driving a car that he had built himself. Nobody had ever won a championship in their own car before and nobody has done it since. He also took out the Constructors Championship in 1966 and in 1967.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir Jack was always willing to have a go and was named Australian of the Year in 1966, a

       </p>
       <p>
        He was a champion driver, an engineer and, more recently, a champion for macular degeneration awareness. To his wife, Margaret, and to his sons the government extends its deepest sympathies.

         I join with the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the life of Australian sporting hero
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jack_Brabham" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Jack Brabham
         </a>
         . A flight mechanic in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         , Jack retained a lifelong love of engine design, construction and repair, and once said that driving was the relaxing part of the world of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" rel="nofollow">
          Formula One
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack began his career in racing purely as a designer and builder of so-called midget cars, because he believed drivers were all lunatics. But in 1948, as a fill-in driver—in only his third race—he won his first speedcar event, the beginning of his journey to the pinnacle of Formula One greatness. Jack won back-to-back world Formula One championships in 1959 and again in 1960. However, his most remarkable victory came in 1966 when he won the championship in a car that he had built himself, a sporting feat that will never be repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack Brabham's success became part of the collective Australian psyche. He was truly the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
          Don Bradman
         </a>
         of the racing circuit, with an iconic modesty and a wry sense of humour and none of the fist pumping and self-congratulation of modern sport. We will not see his like again. All of us in the Labor Party offer our heartfelt condolences to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Margaret" rel="nofollow">

         , Jack's sons, Geoff, Gary and David, and his grandchildren. May he rest in peace.
