         I thank the honourable member for

          Port Adelaide

         for his question. Building long-term productivity growth after years of decline is indeed a central priority of the Rudd government. Like few other areas, development of infrastructure has the capacity to boost the productive economy, to lift our living standards and to lock in our long-term prosperity. That is why infrastructure is a key element of the government’s five-point plan to fight inflation and to boost productivity. The government committed to establishing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         to coordinate nationally significant infrastructure, including transport, water, energy and communications. Infrastructure Australia will develop a strategic blueprint for our nation’s infrastructure and it will drive investment where it is needed most. It is an unprecedented overhaul of the way that we think about infrastructure development in this nation.

         This government makes no apologies for moving away from the ‘business as usual’ approach of the last 11½ years. The

             they would see the warnings from the

             about the capacity constraints and the problems that exist with skills and infrastructure. Twenty warnings on 20 separate occasions were ignored by those opposite. The Rudd Labor government is committed to putting in place structures that will fix the problem.

              The Bureau

             of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics estimates that urban congestion will cost nearly $20 billion by 2015. With the freight task set to double by 2020, the greatest impact will be in urban areas, particularly around our ports, our inner modal terminals and our distribution centres. However, a policy for moving goods will not work without a policy for moving people. It is motorists in their cars, much more than truckies in their cabs, that are clogging our cities. Whether it be road or rail carrying commuters or containers, the systems must work together to achieve the best outcomes for workers, businesses and exporters. Freight must be able to move seamlessly, not be slowed down when moving from the farm gate to the kitchen table and from the mines to the ports.

              Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that statements are usually dealt with at the end of question time and they afford a member of the opposition the chance to respond. This is the standard practice of this House. I note some reference to the new program as accommodating statements. I would request that you tell the minister to come in here and give us answers, not statements.

                Thank you, Mr Speaker. We did not get any answers to questions from the minister for infrastructure in the Howard government because they did not have one. For 12 years they did not have one. We have a plan to address these issues through
