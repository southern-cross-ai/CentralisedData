       <p>
        My question is again to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister’s statement last week regarding the many warnings the government received on the $300 million ‘wheat for weapons’ scandal. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I—
       </p>
       <p>
        that is, Mr Downer—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        have demonstrated, if I may say so, characteristic diligence in ensuring that the department followed up the issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the minister’s office received the 23 June 2003 cable warning him that all contracts—not some contracts but all contracts—had included a kickback of between 10 per cent and 19 per cent, why did the minister fail to act and allow the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        to continue to fund this extraordinary corruption scandal through corrupt contracts with Iraq for a further 16 months? Isn’t it a fact that, through this scandal, the minister’s ‘characteristic diligence’ has instead been dedicated to a sustained effort at a cover-up?

         Firstly, let me say in relation to the last part of the question that throughout all the hearings of the Cole inquiry—I do not mean the media reporting of it but the hearings of the Cole inquiry—there has been no evidence that the government has been involved in a cover-up.

          <p>
           The Leader of the Opposition interjects. The Leader of the Opposition two months ago was not saying that it was a cover-up. The Leader of the Opposition was saying that the government was corrupt—that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, other ministers and I were involved in corruption. ‘The government is corrupt’ has been abandoned and the new position is now that ‘the government is involved in a cover-up’. The simple fact of the matter is that officials from my department have been before the Cole commission and there has been no evidence from those officials that the government has been involved in a cover-up at all. No amount of assertion from the opposition will change the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here it talks about a cable that came in, and an officer of my department absolutely and quite diligently did follow up that cable—and I call on people who have but a passing interest in this issue to look at the transcript of the evidence of the Cole inquiry. Ms Zena Armstrong is a very able and very decent officer of my department—and I stand up for Zena Armstrong. She is a good woman and she is a decent woman.

                 Mr Speaker, the point I make is that Zena Armstrong did follow this up, and I think she followed it up in an appropriate way. The point here is that if the Cole commission were to find that
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
                  AWB
                 </a>
                 Ltd knowingly paid kickbacks—and we will await the results of the Cole commission—they have done so in defiance of the government, in defiance of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                  United Nations
                 </a>
                 and by all accounts—though this is yet to be fully tested in the Cole commission—in a way that was designed to obscure their actions from their very own board.
