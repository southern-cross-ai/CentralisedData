        My question is to the Prime Minister. In the recent bushfires around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_End" rel="nofollow">
         Hill End
        </a>
        area of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , homes and livelihoods have been devastated. When will a disaster declaration be announced, along with a full suite of badly needed support for residents and farmers, including fodder transport subsidies and the $75,000 special disaster grants? Bathurst
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        has kindly donated $19,000 for hay, but almost half is going into transport costs. Farmers need those special disaster grants on the double to help rebuild their lives and properties.

         I thank the member for Calare for his question. I note he went back to his local community during the last sitting week to assist in fighting the fires and to give his community the support they needed at that time, and that was an absolutely correct priority. The biggest fire, the Alpha Road fire, burned more than 18,000 hectares. I can inform the member that a disaster recovery funding assistance declaration was made just this morning. What that does is activate category A and category B assistance under the DRFA. The support the member is referring to—primary producers grants and freight and transport subsidies—would be activated by a request from the Premier, which, because of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         election being close, he would need to make in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. We have not yet received that request, but as soon as we do, if we receive that request, we will prioritise it to ensure that people get the support they need as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the member knows, when there was flooding in his community, I travelled to that community and spent time with the member, with Premier Perrottet and with the local state member there as well—the member for Orange, I think it was—and we provided significant support there. When further representation was made by the member over specific funding, we also gave additional support there.
        </p>
        <p>
         As of this morning there are still 34 bush and grass fires going across New South Wales, with two of those fires yet to be contained. More than 500 personnel are currently undertaking firefighting efforts across New South Wales and there are 21 aircraft deployed across the state. Across New South Wales these fires are having a devastating impact. They come off the back of the significant flooding events that have occurred. Disaster recovery assistance is being made available, when the request is made. That provides for freight subsidies for primary producers and it provides for concessional loans of up to $130,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the member for the work he has done representing his local community. I say to the member that if he keeps in touch with my office, we, along with the minister, Senator Watt, will do what needs to be done to defend that community.
