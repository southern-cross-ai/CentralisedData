        Would you believe a regional centre, the Hinkler electorate, has three representatives at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for 2024? I want to congratulate the three of them: Isaac Cooper for swimming, Keira Stephens as a paralympic swimmer, and Matt Hauser for triathlon. They're all incredible athletes, all very dedicated and all very hardworking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here's a little bit about their history. Isaac Cooper is just 20 years old. His hometown is Bundaberg. This is his second Olympics. He competed in the Tokyo 2020 games, and he won a bronze medal at those games as a member of the 4 x 100 metre mixed medley relay team. His junior club—and congratulations to them—is the Fairymead Swimming Club in Bundaberg, named after the sugar mill where I did my apprenticeship. Unfortunately, it's now been demolished.
       </p>

        Keira Stephens is 21. Her hometown is

        . She made her Paralympic debut at Tokyo 2020. She also won a bronze at the women's 100 metre breaststroke

       </p>
       <p>
        Matt Hauser is a 26-year-old triathlete. His hometown is Hervey Bay. He attended Xavier Catholic College. It's his second Olympics, and he's currently ranked fourth in the world—from Hervey Bay in Queensland! What a phenomenal effort! He also competed in the Commonwealth Games and won gold in 2018 at the
