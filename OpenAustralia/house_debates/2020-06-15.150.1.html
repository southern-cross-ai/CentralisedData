        from 2007 till 2008 and, following that, as deputy president until his retirement in 2011. Alan still has many friends in this place and in the other. He made friends here, not enemies, right across the parliament.

        Nyurpaya Kaika Burton was awarded an OAM for her service to Indigenous visual arts. She was born at Pukatja in 1949 and lives on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">
         APY
        </a>
        Lands about 100 kilometres down the road at Amata, where there is the very highly rated Tjala Arts centre. Her works incorporate painting, weaving and installation basket making techniques, and she's also skilled in wood carving. Her work is held in a number of public collections, including at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">

        was awarded an OAM for service to visual arts and to the community. Jeff is one of the world's great panorama painters. His gallery at Hawker has to be seen to be believed. There are two stunning panoramas, the first of

        Peter Mungkuri, who was awarded an OAM, was born near Mimili in South Australia. He is another Indigenous artist. He was a stockman across the lands and, drawing from his memories, he paints important landscapes reflecting his knowledge of land and country. He has exhibited extensively in Australia and was recently included in Tarnanthi, the inaugural festival of Aboriginal and

        was awarded an OAM for service to the community of Whyalla. Bob has served his community of Whyalla in the aged-care sector and in the Whyalla branch of the Royal Association of Justices of South Australia, a group which caters for the needs of justices of the peace in and around Whyalla to help them get together, access training and work on their craft.

        The late Mumu Mike Williams was awarded an OAM for services to Indigenous visual arts in Mimili. He was born near Kenmore Park and was a strong campaigner for the return of the lands under the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill in 1981. In his art he communicated a message about Anungu people having a connection to and standing strong in country.

        Sergeant Trevor Milne was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        . Trevor had worked in both Peterborough and Whyalla in my electorate since the 1970s and made an outstanding contribution to crime scene investigation, forensic services and systems, and police working conditions. Trevor worked as a crime scene supervisor, was leader of the

         SA Ambulance Service
        </a>
        . The ambulance service saves lives through the efforts of dedicated volunteers like John. His commitment to this vital organisation over more than two decades is a credit to his community spirit. He has demonstrated great leadership within the organisation and has earned the respect of his community and his peers.

        Last but not leastâ€”I have been clipping along at a fair rate, Mr Speakerâ€”Squadron Leader Dave Bywater was awarded the

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . I met Dave at the Anzac Day service in 2019 at Wasleys. There is a population of about 110 people, I reckon, at Wasleys. He's a very fine young member of the Australian Defence Force. He's only 36. He's a first-class person, just like so many in our defence forces, and just like the rest of the people on this list.
