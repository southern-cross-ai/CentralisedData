        For years in this place I've been one of many voices advocating for targeted sanctions on regimes committing egregious human rights abuses. Magnitsky laws were passed in 2021, with bipartisan support, and the Albanese government is putting them to use. It's imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on individuals and entities responsible for human rights abuses in Myanmar and Iran. The Australian government announced sanctions on 16 members of the Myanmar military regime's governing State Administration Council, key individuals directly responsible for the coup two years ago. Two Myanmar military controlled commercial entities, Myanma Economic Public Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation, will also be subject to targeted financial sanctions. Over the past few years Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        and international partners have repeatedly called on the Myanmar military junta to restore democracy. Despite these calls, the regime has continued its antidemocratic actions against the people of Myanmar. The military regime has killed thousands of innocent civilians. Estimates are of 3,000 people killed and 17,000 people arbitrarily arrested.

        The Australian government is also imposing Magnitsky-style sanctions on 16 Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity. This includes senior law enforcement, political and military figures in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRGC" rel="nofollow">
         IRGC
        </a>
        and the Basij Cooperative Foundation. We're joining our partners to impose additional targeted sanctions on four Iranian individuals who have been involved in the production and supply of drones to Russia. Australia stands with the people of Myanmar, the people of Iran and the people of Ukraine.
