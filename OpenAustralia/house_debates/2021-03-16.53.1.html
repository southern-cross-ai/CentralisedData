        My question is to the Prime Minister. Former Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC" rel="nofollow">
         SC
        </a>
        says the allegations against the Attorney-General should be referred to the current Solicitor-General. Why did the Prime Minister not seek the Solicitor-General's advice before he declared that the rule of law would be harmed by an independent inquiry into sexual assault allegations against the Attorney-General? Who provided the legal advice to support the Prime Minister's declaration?

         I thank the member for her question. The advice suggested by the former Solicitor-General was not advice that was tendered to me by the government. The advice that I followed and the advice that I sought came from the

          Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet

         There are established processes for dealing with all members of this House, former members of this House and any Australians: they all face one rule of law. They all face one rule of law. It's important that consistent standards are applied when it comes to such sensitive issues relating to allegations of sexual assault. I quote the member for Maribyrnong when he was the subject of such allegations—

            I'll rule that the Prime Minister is still being relevant to the question. There was a preamble and, essentially, one question was, 'Why?' and the other was, 'Who?' He's giving some context for the stance he has taken on behalf of the government. I think he is in order at this point.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker. It's a matter of consistency. As the member for Maribyrnong rightly said at the time:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             … the police have concluded their work, they have made their decision and now I think it's appropriate to draw a line under the matter and that's what I'm going to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             That position was supported by then Prime Minister Abbott, who said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Apparently it's been dealt with by the police and I don't think there's really anything more to say about it … so it seems that it is at an end.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then I quote the member for Sydney herself: 'We should now be able to draw a line under it.' On this matter, the police have concluded their dealings with this matter. As a result, I have applied exactly the same approach to this matter as was applied to the member for Maribyrnong.
            </p>
            <p>
             The double standards that the Labor Party is seeking to apply here are simply quite galling. The member for Maribyrnong was right to say that then, but the member for Sydney says that it's not right for others to say it now. This is a clear demonstration that the Labor Party is not engaging with this issue in good faith; the Labor Party is simply trying to exact political opportunity from the terrible trauma and circumstances that staff face in this office. Even now, the Labor Party knows that there are allegations—
