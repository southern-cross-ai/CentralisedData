        I rise to bring to the attention of the House the fact that 'Where's William?' walks are being held all around Australia and the world this Saturday, 12 September. This date marks one year since William Tyrell disappeared from his grandmother's garden in the sleepy hamlet of Kendall. The Bravehearts Camden Haven committee, led by chairperson Dale Symons, has organised a 'Walk 4 William' day this Saturday, commencing at 10.30 am. The walk will go from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hotel" rel="nofollow">

        in Kew to the Kendall Memorial Park. This will be followed by a fundraising afternoon tea at Kendall showgrounds, hosted by Kendall's Where's William? committee. William's parents want to thank everyone who has helped in the search for William Tyrell so far.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bravehearts is a wonderful organisation, which I have been an active supporter of since 2013 when we formed the mid-north coast Bravehearts committee. The committee members, the volunteers, have been very active in supporting the Where's William? campaign. Not only have they been distributing Where's William? merchandise, including T-shirts, caps and ribbons; they have also been sending kit overseas because of the interest in child protection that has been highlighted by the unfortunate circumstance of William Tyrell.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate founding members Malcolm Neale, Erica Nelson, Louise Wycowski, Janette Hyde, Sue Tylman and Trudy Tracey, as well as Kylie Biltrisson and Bix Johansson who have moved on to other areas of the country and other pursuits. Bravehearts is doing a fantastic job with the Where's William? campaign. Somebody must know something. Any bit of information is really worthwhile. Give any information that you have to the local police and support Bravehearts in any shape or form, because they are Australia-wide and they are educating, empowering and protecting children.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the mid-north coast we have set up a Ditto suite of education programs. Videos have been distributed to many schools and preschools so that our youngest and dearest can be educated, empowered and protected. It is such a simple thing to teach children what is inappropriate. The Ditto program, with the big, cuddly Ditto bear and the

        presentation in song and dance, teaches children what is appropriate and how to seek help from those who are in positions that can protect them. I highly commend this committee's work, and I highly commend the Where's William? campaign. If anyone has any information, no matter how small or trivial it might seem, please get onto
