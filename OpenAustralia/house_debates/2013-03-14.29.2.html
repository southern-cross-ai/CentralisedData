        On the 28 November 2012, the Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard MP, made a number of remarks about me which I wish to refute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister asserted “He [Michael Smith] is the man who was sacked for wanting to defame me, basing that defamation on an affidavit drawn up by John Pasquarelli of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">

        It is untrue that I was sacked. I resigned from

        (radio 2UE). It also is false that I wanted to defame the Prime Minister. Finally, I have never read an affidavit drawn up by John Pasquarelli.

        That the report be agreed to.

       <p>
        The report that I present concerns an application from a person for the publication of a response to references made about him in the House. The committee has recommended to the House that the response in the terms included in the report be incorporated in the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . In recommending that the response be incorporated in the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , the committee emphasises that, as required by the right of reply resolution, it has not considered or judged the truth of any statements made by the member in the House or by the person seeking a response.

        Question agreed to.
