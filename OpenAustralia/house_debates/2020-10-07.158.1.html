        I'd like to recognise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         John McDonald
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ" rel="nofollow">
         JJ
        </a>
        , from Casino. John recently passed away and will be sadly missed by his family and, indeed, the whole community. Just before he passed, John had an oval at Casino's Queen Elizabeth Reserve officially named after him. It's great recognition for the achievements and contribution he made to local cricket over 65 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        His first game of cricket was for Tatham in 1948, and his cricket career spanned 55 years. During this time, he scored 11 centuries. JJ was also heavily involved in the administration of Casino District Cricket Association. He spent 30 years as the treasurer and 12 years as the vice president. He has received many accolades—life membership of the Casino District Cricket Association, Far North Coast Cricket Council and Casino Bowling Club, and he was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Sports Medal
        </a>
        in 2000 and a volunteer services award in 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        John and his wife, Maxine, raised six kids at their farm in Tatham—Colleen, John, Catherine, Alison, Tanya and Susanne. JJ and Maxine also had 13 grandchildren—Andrew, Amanda, Sarah, Ashley, Thomas, James, Samantha, David, Matthew, Rachael, Ryan, Hailey and Gus. We have lost, in our community, a true gentleman and a man who was dedicated to our community. Rest in peace, JJ.

        I'd like to recognise Peter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkins" rel="nofollow">
         Perkins
        </a>
        from Grafton. Peter has recently retired after 39 years as a bus driver with Busways. He's one of the valley's longest-serving bus drivers. He worked at the Grafton depot for his entire career as a school and long-term charter driver. Peter met his wife Sandra when they were 17 at a dance at the pavilion. They have two daughters, Carolyn and Susanne. Sandra says it was always Peter's dream to be a bus driver. He never complained or had any problems with the kids, although he was strict and made sure they were always seated. He also worked and inherited his father's butcher shop, Perkins Butchery in South Grafton, which was famous for its toys in the windows. Thank you, Peter, and congratulations on your retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to congratulate Glenda
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogan" rel="nofollow">
         Rogan
        </a>
        and her dog Buddy from Copmanhurst: they have just won the 2020 Cobber Challenge. This is a competition for top working dogs across the country. The dogs are given a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" rel="nofollow">
         GPS
        </a>
        collar that tracks their distance, working duration and speed over a three-week period. Glenda and Buddy set a new Cobber Challenge record on their beef cattle property, Cinnabar, at Copmanhurst. Buddy did 835 kilometres over a three-week period, worked 98 hours and recorded an average speed of 8½ kilometres per hour. Glenda said after the win that Buddy got two juicy bones, a comfy bed and a big cuddle. Congratulations Glenda and Buddy!
