        The minister and I have agreed to act as gentlemen and not waste time but actually ask questions and seek answers, and I thank the minister for his agreement to that. Minister, can you inform the Federation Chamber when the decision was made to cut $5.4 billion from the defence budget?

             I am happy to do that. Minister, the budget reveals cuts of $1.6 billion in equipment acquisitions in the Defence Capability Plan. Can you outline—or, if you cannot, can you take it on notice—what these cuts are, the strategic rationale for those cuts, why those and not others, and what the impact of those cuts will be? Likewise, there is $1.3 billion in cuts from the approved major capital acquisition program. Again, what are the cuts, what was the strategic rationale for those as opposed to others and what will the impact be? There is $400 million that has been taken from ADF housing over the forward estimates. Can you outline exactly where those cuts are coming from and the impact in terms of housing? There is $1.2 billion in cuts from the major capital facilities program. Again, what are these cuts and what impact will these cuts have on personnel?

               I have a question to the minister, but I will make a few comments first. The commitment by the government to commit 12 future submarines to be assembled in

                South Australia
               </a>
               is welcome news for my local constituents. I have to commend the former Premier,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann" rel="nofollow">
                Mike Rann
               </a>
               , and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Foley" rel="nofollow">
                Kevin Foley
               </a>
               , the former defence industries minister, for having the foresight to make South Australia a defence state. It is their foresight that has led to a situation where in South Australia we clearly have—I will let the minister and the Federation Chamber know—the capacity to complete this project. As a very proud South Australian I say that there have been a lot of defence projects which have been very successfully delivered in South Australia and that this one will be no exception.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was also very pleased with the government's recent decision, which was announced in May, to commit $214 million on the first stage of the Future Submarine Project. This was certainly welcome news. There has been discussion about this for a long time, and it was very pleasing for my local electorate to be given the certainty about it from this government. Unfortunately, no such commitment has been made by the opposition. I know it is not the member on the other side; I know he would love to build the submarines in South Australia. Unfortunately, the member for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                North Sydney
               </a>
               and the Leader of the Opposition will not commit to that. That is very concerning and, I think, does put some uncertainty in the project.
              </p>
              <p>
               From the government's point of view I am pleased to see that there is the commitment for this. It builds on, I note, the 2009 white paper, which outlined the government's commitment to acquire 12 new future submarines to be assembled in South Australia. I am very pleased that that commitment has been forthcoming with the announcement of the first stage. I think that is really important.
              </p>
              <p>
               The opportunity for South Australia in this project cannot be underestimated. Discussions I have had with the defence industry and with the minister indicate that we are talking about not 10 years or 20 years of investment and economic activity as a result of this project in South Australia but 50 years to 100 years of exciting economic activity.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have seen with the air warfare destroyer project that certainly South Australia has the capacity in Techport to be able to bring expertise together to deliver on defence projects. In terms of bringing industry together, I think that area in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
                Port Adelaide
               </a>
               has really come of age and is ready to deliver. They are very pleased, and, in the conversations that I have had, people have welcomed this commitment by the government.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is very concerning that the opposition will not commit to this project. It is very concerning that we do not have bipartisan support for it. That fact does cause a lot of uncertainty for people in South Australia and for businesses in South Australia.

               I would call on the opposition to look at it very carefully. As I said, I know the member on the other side's commitment. It is a pity that the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition does not share his commitment to this. It is very concerning. It would be good if the opposition could come on board with us and make it bipartisan. Certainly that is what people in South Australia want. Unfortunately this is symptomatic of the opposition's neglecting South Australia. Whether on water, on defence spending or on Holdens, really what the opposition leader has been clearly saying to South Australians is that he has no interest in them. But back to the issue at hand. My question to the minister is: can the minister update the chamber on the government's commitment to the future submarine capacity?

                <p>
                 Let me first go to the general issues which were raised and the specific questions which were raised by the shadow minister. Obviously the decisions were made in the budget process through the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC" rel="nofollow">
                  ERC
                 </a>
                 process in a timely fashion prior to the budget. As he rightly pointed out, there is $4.45 million worth of savings across the forward estimates, including a contribution of $971 million in 2012-13.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do want to make a couple of points just so that we understand the nature of these cuts. The contribution will have no adverse effect on operations in Afghanistan,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                  East Timor
                 </a>
                 or the Solomons, and I think that is commonly understood. It will not have any impact on the provision of defence equipment, defence personnel and operations. They will not be adversely affected, as you would expect. There will be no adverse impact on the number of ADF personnel engaged within the services. What we are doing is looking at the impacts of some of the reform—the strategically reform processes—and making sure that the impacts on entitlements to ADF personnel are being minimised. I understand that would be an issue which you will probably raise. I am happy to talk about that in more detail later.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think I need to make the observation and the point that there has been no fundamental change to our defence budget from a strategic perspective. That is vitally important if we are to understand where we are going here. In 2009-10, the budget for the government for the first time was over $100 million for defence. That was across the forward estimates. In the 2011-12 portfolio additional estimates, the defence budget across the four-year forward estimates period was $103.4 billion. The budget this year is $103.3 billion. This level of funding will maintain Australia's status in the top 15 nations in the world of defence expenditure. We will continue to be the second on the list of military expenditure per capita, with only the United States spending more. So we need to understand that perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The opposition spokesman has asked me about savings through the Defence Capability Plan since the 2009 white paper. I just want to preface this. I do not necessarily want to have a political dialogue which is about animus, but I do still want to make a couple of observations. This is a $5.4 billion save over the forward estimates. It is for a particular reason which is well known to the parliament and the people of Australia: to get us into surplus. We were asked to make a contribution. We are making a contribution, but the significant question—and this is something which I know the opposition spokesperson will take on board, and I would like to think he could tell us what is happening—is: are the opposition committed to these savings? The real question, apart from the dialogue we will have about the capability development plan, is whether or not the opposition are committed to these sort of savings—or are they going to say they are not going to proceed? If they are going to say that, they have got to tell us where the money is coming from. We already know there is a $70 billion black hole. What they need to be able to tell us now is: if they do not want to support these savings measures, where will the money come from? It is a very simple but very important question which needs to be asked. Let me go to the issue of the Defence Capability Plan.

                 There were 180 capability projects in the 2009-2019 defence capability plan that underpin the 2009 defence white paper. Fewer than 10 projects have been scrapped as a result of revisions the

                 Since the 2009 white paper, government has approved over 100 first or second pass and other approvals, including studies, risk reduction activities, capability technology demonstrations and project development funding with a total value of nearly $13.5 billion. This includes the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 naval combat helicopters, over 900 additional G-wagon trucks, seven CH-47F new Chinook helicopters and two more D model Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter

The government has also allocated funding for essential new capabilities not envisaged in the 2009 defence white paper, including the new amphibious heavy lift ship

                 , two additional C17 heavy lift aircraft for a total of six, and 101 more bushmasters with further orders likely. We remain committed through this budget, and this is apparent in the budget papers, to the core capabilities as outlined in the 2009 defence white paper, including 12 future submarines—I will come to those more specifically in a moment—the joint strike fighter and the replacement for the caribou aircraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will respond to my colleague's questions about the submarines. Earlier this month the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for Defence Materiel,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Clare" rel="nofollow">
                  Jason Clare
                 </a>
                 , announced that the government would provide $214 million—and I am sure this will be supported by the opposition—for the next stage of the future submarine project. The funding will go towards further detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarine. The future submarine project is the biggest and most complex defence project Australia has ever embarked upon. It means work for hundreds of Australian companies and thousands of Australian workers, including boilermakers, welders, electricians, naval architects, engineers and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have a question again for the opposition. Are they committed to this project? Are they committed to having these vessels built in Australia? We know that the shadow treasurer on Channel 7 during the week of the budget said that they want to see what the benefit is in building the submarines here in Australia rather than getting cheaper versions from overseas. I think it is quite important that we understand, through this discussion we are having here, what the government is committed to and what the opposition is committed to. We have announced these savings, which are big, but at the same time we have made our commitment to the future development of Australian defence capability—including submarines—very clear. Clearly we want to see them built here in Australia, and we have maintained our commitment all along. I ask the opposition, if they can, to tell us what their position is.

                    <p>
                     I will just go to the question of the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASPI" rel="nofollow">
                      ASPI
                     </a>
                     paper, which has been referred to by the shadow minister. Let us be very clear: the defence appropriation for 2012-13 is $24.2 billion. In the 2009-10 budget, the government for the first time budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. In this budget, the government has again budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. This includes $21 billion in total capital investment. The level of funding is expected to maintain Australia's status, as I referred to earlier, as number 13 in defence expenditure. I referred also to our per capita contribution, which is second only to the United States. In real dollar terms, we spend far more than any regional neighbour. Also, with the appreciation of the foreign exchange rate, we have been able to purchase the same equipment from overseas for less. Thus, whilst announced savings will be difficult, the defence budget—as you well know—remains at historically high levels. Reprioritisation with defence expenditure has been designed to have minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I note that the opposition seems to support the views expressed in the ASPI paper, which asserts that the government has manifestly placed a higher priority on delivering a surplus than on delivering a stronger Defence Force. It is not an either-or situation. The government remains committed to delivering the core capabilities identified in the 2009 white paper and to delivering one of the most capable defence forces in our region, but global and domestic economic circumstances have changed significantly since that white paper, which I am sure is well understood by the shadow minister but perhaps not so well understood by some of his colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The effects of the global financial crisis have continued to unfold with unexpected severity and duration since the 2009 defence white paper. In response to this, as we have maintained from the get-go, this government is committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. As was made clear before the budget, Defence had to expect to make a contribution. That contribution has been made. The reprioritisation of defence expenditure has been designed to have a minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Another part of that ASPI report says that clearly it is the government's priority for defence that has fallen rather than its absolute ability to pay. That is simply not the case. The 2009 defence white paper noted that the global financial crisis was the most serious global economic and financial crisis in decades and that its strategic impacts were still unfolding. Since the

                     has continued to have a significant impact on the global economy, following the GFC the defence forces of major developed countries have increased efficiencies and reduced their budgets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Of course, the other

Australia's 2009 defence white paper was completed before the unfolding of these events and the financial circumstances clearly represent a real challenge to the 2013 white paper. In terms of core capabilities, there are some 180 capability projects in the 2009-10 Defence Capability Plan that underpin the 2009 white paper. As I said previously, the vast majority of these remain, with 10 being removed. Most of those 10 have either had their scope reduced or were subsumed by other, related projects or replaced by newer technologies. I said before our commitments in this budget are for the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 new Navy helicopters, 900 additional G-Wagen trucks, additional Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter-

                     equipment assistance, towed artillery systems and, of course, communication equipment. In 2011 the government approved a record 49 capability projects. The previous record was 37 in 2006.

                       The decisions the opposition is requesting have been taken to address changes that have occurred in the department's resources position over the last year which include a range of new cost pressures across the portfolio, including the following priority areas for investment: $700 million for additional investment in Collins-class submarine sustainment, $550 million for information technology remediation activities across Defence, $400 million for improved housing for

                       personnel, $330 million for relocation of defence units from Moorebank to Holsworthy to allow development of the intermodal transport hub, $270 million in additional funding for Navy fleet sustainment, $220 million for investment in maintenance and upgrades of the Defence estate, $160 million for fringe benefit tax liabilities, $150 million for enhanced garrison support services and $70 million for further investment and international engagement under the Defence Cooperation Program.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       To manage these internal cost pressures Defence has reallocated and reprioritised $2.9 billion. The majority of that $2.9 billion was reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the approved major capital investment program, with further savings, predominantly in 2012-13, from across the general department operating budget. These savings from across the general department operating budget include Navy reprioritising its operating activities and reviewing all non-operational activities, including Navy's international program, and Army reducing the use of

                       Abrams tanks. That some of these vehicles will be placed in temporary storage is well known now. Army will continue to review these fleets to ensure a viable mechanised capability is maintained.

                      <p>
                       These budget initiatives build on the efficiencies and savings gained through the Strategic Reform Program, including in the areas of capability development, procurement and acquisition, and the strengthening of personnel and institutional capabilities. The reform will be further considered during the development of the 2013 Defence white paper to ensure that, as you would expect, defence spending, in light of the forced posture review, revised Defence Capability Plan and the savings that have already been identified, is calibrated against an up-to-date assessment of our circumstances in both the short and longer terms. It is important that we acknowledge that some hard decisions have been taken in this budget, and we do not shy away from those decisions. I think it is very important also to say that there is no question about us not accepting the need to make changes in the way we do our business, and we are doing that. We have made it very clear that the allocation across the department was being, as I said earlier, reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the Approved Major Capital Investment Program with further savings, predominately in 2012-13, from across the general departmental operating budget. It is very clear to us that we have a job to do here to make sure that we operate more efficiently and that we get better outcomes for the dollar we expend, and that has to happen right across the organisation. I do want to commend the organisation for being part of the decision making and for understanding what these responsibilities mean in terms of providing advice to government as to what we might best do to achieve our targets.

                        In a place that often focuses on the differences between the parties, I think both sides of the chamber agree on one thing and that is that one of the pre-eminent objectives for us in Afghanistan is the protection of our troops and of their wellbeing in Afghanistan. One of the things that I did want to focus on this morning in my question to the minister is what we are doing to protect troops there. I am led to believe that we have undertaken a number of measures in the course of the last year. There is new lighter combat body armour and a new combat uniform, longer range machine guns and upgrades to the Bushmasters. I understand that in the course of the last year we have let out a contract for the manufacture of over 100 new Bushmasters in Victoria and the upgrades to the ones in Afghanistan are designed to make them even more secure. I also see that we have put in place a counter-rocket system in
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
                         Tarin Kowt
                        </a>
                        to provide additional protection of troops there. Clearly these measures are critical.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In addition to this, a

                         MultiCam
                        </a>
                        camouflage uniform is being trialled to provide troops with even greater levels of concealment across the various terrains within Afghanistan. Obviously that is critical for them there. The new uniform, with its new elbow and knee pads, is designed to reduce soft tissue injuries. The uniform is cooler, it is designed to be worn under the body armour, and it has a padded waistband to make it even more comfortable under webbing or a field pack. And it has more pockets and stretch fabric at the joints.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I said earlier that the upgrade of the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles will make them even safer. The upgrade will include the installation of protected weapons stations to reduce the exposure of crew operating vehicle-fitted weapons; internal spall liners that provide vehicle occupants with better protection from direct fire and side blasts; and new seating and flooring, giving troops in the vehicle better protection against spinal and lower limb injuries from the blast effects of

                        </a>
                        s. I want to ask, Minister: is there any other research being undertaken to further build on this commitment in terms of protecting our troops? I am wondering if you can outline that to the chamber.

                               just say that the measures you have outlined are in fact all accurate. We have, under Colonel Jason Blaine, Diggerworks—which I am sure the shadow minister is aware of—which is a program designed to ensure that we have got the best possible equipment for our men and women who are on deployment doing the business for us in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It has proven to be a very successful program which has led to changes, which largely you have outlined.

Whilst I am not at liberty to talk about the sorts of developments that have been produced directly as a result of their research into looking after our troops in Afghanistan, you can rest assured that as a result of the work which is being done by

You mentioned the Bushmasters; they are a case in point. A lot of the work which has led to the changes in the way we actually provide these vehicles is a result of research which has been done in the first instance through DSTO. It is very important work.

                               I just want to come back to the opposition shadow minister's question on strategic reform. As you know, the strategic reform program was announced as part of the defence white paper in 2009. It is an ambitious reform program that aims to find $20.6 billion in cost reductions across the decade, 2009-2019, for reinvestment in defence capability. We expect to meet our $1.284 billion target for the 2011-12 financial year. This comes on top of our meeting the $797 million target in 2009-10 and the $1.016 billion target in 2010-11.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               But I do want to make clear and have it really understood that the
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRP" rel="nofollow">
                                SRP

                               is not just a cost reduction program. It is a decade-long program of reform that is driving a greater understanding of defence business. Its cost drivers have started a culture shift in the organisation. Now the SRP is three years old, and the substance underpinning that program of course change and as a result of changes to the defence-funding profile and further detailed examination of proposed reform activities over the intervening years. The SRP, although achieving its targets, does face challenges. When it was agreed, it was the only major reform initiative within defence. Circumstances have evolved dramatically since. The effects of the global financial crisis, as I said earlier, have been a significant driver for us. At the time of the 2011-12 budget it was determined there would be a $1.6 billion underspend for 2010-11 and $1.3 billion of capital funding to be reprogrammed. This represented significant failure in defence's planning and advising process.

                               In addition, the defence reform agenda has been expanded to include a number of new and important reforms, including the review of the Defence Accountability Framework, the Black review—as a result of that defence is strengthening its personnel and institutional accountability arrangements; expansion of the use of shared services in defence to increase efficiency; the plan to reform ship repair and maintenance, the Rizzo review; the review into Collins class submarines, the Coles review; the Pathway to Cultural Change, which is enhancing defence culture; and a range of important procurement and capability reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the acquisition of new equipment for the

                               have also been implemented. These include reforming defence planning, decision-making processes and performance management; substantially reducing the number of committees in defence; increasing the rigour, contestability and expertise within capability development; and strengthening the Projects of Concern process. We remain committed to the SRP, notwithstanding the $1.9 billion target in 2012-13. We will continue with the strategic reform program activities underway in the lead-up to the 2013 white paper. Defence reform, including how the range of existing reform initiatives will be integrated, will be a major theme of the Defence white paper which was announced by the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence on 3 May. This is something that we are looking at right now. Further details of future strategic reform in defence and how the range of initiatives will be integrated will form part of the 2013 white paper.

                               I think that adequately deals with the issue of the SRP, and I hope that the opposition understand that we remain committed. I am not sure about you—and that is the question. I go back to what I said originally. We need to understand whether or not the opposition are committed to the savings which we have identified. If not, why not? What are they going to change and how are they going to get the money if they are not? I ask whether or not you are committed to the strategic reform program, as we are, and if not, why not?

Twenty Army major capital facility projects have been delayed by up to three years, Minister, including the construction of Kapooka's working accommodation. I understand that general running expenses at the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka have been, as a result, reduced by a quarter. Last year, 4,000 recruits went through the base—2,300 regular soldiers and 1,700 Army reserve. The cutbacks mean such things as the commandant, instead of travelling to other bases for important face-to-face talks with other colonels and military chiefs, is now forced to do this by telephone. Is this satisfactory for a base which is so important to our defence capabilities?

This 22.6 hectares of land has been combined with the 143 hectares already owned by the Queensland government. That will see the transfer of aerospace and defence support industries and companies such as Boeing, currently located at the RAAF base, which will make sure that there are thousands of jobs and the viability of that sector. Over the years, the RAAF base at Amberley has seen a dramatic increase in operational capacity and the number of personnel.

                                  I have noticed some media commentary in relation to the cutbacks. My questions relate to the RAAF base at Amberley, particularly the operational capacity of the RAAF base. I know that the government has made a decision to buy the fifth and sixth C17 Globemasters to be based at the RAAF base at Amberley. We welcome that and the military personnel. Ipswich has had military personnel since 1861, when we were not flying planes. I note the cutbacks are mainly in civilian and administrative capacities. Minister, will the cutbacks have any adverse operational impact on the RAAF base at Amberley? Is the government's commitment to the RAAF base at Amberley undiminished? Please update the chamber on the procurement of battlefield airlift aircraft to replace the retired Caribou.

The loss of the Caribou was quite a loss in terms of short take-off and landing. The C-27J will add significant capability to our arsenal.

The response from Senator Johnston then was that there were merits in both C27 and C295 but at $1.4 billion the C27 would cost the taxpayer more than twice as much as the C295. That is untrue. The cost of the C27J and the C295 aircraft are roughly comparable.

                                           What Senator Johnston fails to understand and acknowledge is that the $1.4 billion includes not only the acquisition cost of the aircraft but also the modifications to the aircraft for equipment needed for specific ADF roles, including initial logistics support, testing and certification. These costs would apply to any aircraft platform chosen, including the C295. Senator Johnston said, 'In the eyes of just about every other air force around the world the C295 is not only considered to be the best value for money but also the most effective battlefield airlifter.' Unfortunately, those are not views shared by the

                                             I will be brief. How many single soldiers, sailors and airmen over the age of 21 will be impacted by the cancelling of the ostensibly one free flight home a year? How much money is the military saving as a result of this change, and what other areas of entitlements is the government looking to cancel for soldiers, sailors and airmen?

Recreation leave travel was previously provided to single ADF members and consisted of annual Commonwealth funded return travel from the member's posting location to the location of their nominated next of kin. Defence has assessed that the policy is decreasing in relevance in the contemporary ADF and it should come as no surprise that Defence, as it should, continually assesses its personnel policies for relevance and appropriateness in order to implement and fund newer, better or more relevant policies in place of older, more outdated policies that needed review.

                                              Major General Fogarty, head of People and Capability, said on 25 May that, unlike in previous years where single soldiers had to live on base, in the confined barracks environment, many members of the military are now based in communities outside the barracks, and that the benefit has become outdated. He said: 'It has become redundant, and the cost of travel within Australia is a totally different environment today to what it was 40 years ago.'
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chief" rel="nofollow">

                                              of Defence Force also stated on 25 May that 'the free airfare for older single people was outdated' and that it was in place when he joined the Army 40 years ago, when salaries were low and airfares were very expensive from such places as Townsville. He said: 'The world has changed since that was introduced. You get cheaper airfares, communications are different and the town is not so isolated anymore.' And, importantly, of course, this measure will have no impact on single members who are posted to remote localities such as Darwin and Cairns, because they will still have an entitlement to remote locality leave travel. There will remain an entitlement of three trips a year for trainees and ADF members under the age of 21 will continue to get the entitlement.

                                              Sometimes we make these decisions, and they are difficult decisions, but they need to be made. In this context it is very clear that we want to continue to continually monitor the entitlements that we provide to our Defence Force members. I am particularly pleased, frankly, that the overall package is such that it attracts such large numbers of people to our defence community. And whilst we have had retention issues previously—that is, people not wanting to leave; retention levels have been very good—we are seeing a bit of a change. I do not expect this particular policy item, this new change, to have any impact on our recruitment of new personnel.

                                                Sorry, can I just respond to the member for Blair. My apologies for not responding to you earlier. I will get you some more detail about the cost impacts on your community. I suspect they will be minimal. In fact, I got a bit of work done, which we are doing again at the moment, on what the investment has been in defence communities across the country over the last decade. I am trying to get it now for the current financial year, which will help you. When I have it, I will make it available to you. In terms of catafalque parties, that is a matter for the defence forces themselves.

                                                  I am not looking at any particular areas of entitlements to cut. I only have a minute to go, and I would be very pleased if you could actually respond to the question I asked of the shadow minister about whether or not the opposition are committed to this $5.4 billion worth of savings. If not, which of those savings will they not proceed with? He has indicated, on his own level, that the leave travel entitlement will not be proceeded with—that is, I think, $15 million over the forward estimates. If that is not being proceeded with, what other measures that we have announced will not be proceeded with? You have an obligation to front the Australian community and tell us precisely what you intend to do in terms of the budget and in terms of these savings which have been proposed. And I am hoping that, in the last minute, you might actually respond by telling us what the opposition's position is.

The current budget has a 10 per cent decline in real terms. Minister, can you inform the House of what guarantees or promises can be believed at all from this government with respect to defence?

                                                     I will just respond very quickly. I think it is a bit cute. We hear constantly in the parliament from the Leader of the Opposition and from all the shadow ministers—in a chorus, really—a negative tirade around what government is doing or not doing. They have rubbished the budget. They have a $70 billion black hole, but they cannot tell us, or will not tell us, whether or not they are committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings in the defence budget. If you are not committed to these savings, you have an obligation to tell the Australian community what it is you are committed to. If you are not committed to these savings which we have identified, what do you intend to do? How will you fill the $70 billion black hole—to which, if you are not committed to these savings, we can add another $5.4 billion? You have an obligation not only to the Australian community but to the

                                                     to tell them what your intention is. What we do know is that there is confusion, because there are different words coming out of the mouths of the shadow minister for defence and the shadow minister for defence science and personnel. I just say to them: get your act together. Ask the shadow Treasurer—although he will have a conflicting view, it is clear. He wants to buy the submarines from overseas, costing Australian workers' jobs.

                                                     We are committed in this budget to extending the purchases that we have outlined in terms of our capability development, and we have invested in excess of $200 million for the further development of the submarines, which we want built in Australia—12 of them, to be built in Adelaide. You would think we would hear from the opposition whether they are committed to that process or not. To this point, we have heard nothing apart from confusion and dissembling. Tell us the truth: are you committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings we are proposing in this budget or not? If not, itemise which of these items you are not prepared to support and tell us where the savings are coming from.

We are committed to the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB pensions. We took it to the 2010 election. In response to that, we then put a private member's bill in, which of course the Labor Party voted against. Then the Leader of the Opposition,

You asked what we are committed to, Minister. That is what we are committed to. My question to you, Minister, is: are you committed? You have asked for the coalition to say upfront right now what we are committed to, and I have just told you what we are going to do. We are committed to it. We will do it in the first year of an Abbott government. Minister, are you committed to the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB pensions? Will you commit right now in the House, as you have asked the opposition to do—today, now—to index the DFRDB and DFRB pensions in the same way as the age pension, as you led the veteran community to believe that you would do prior to the 2007 election?

                                                            All you have said is you do not support the leave travel entitlement. That is all you have said. That leaves another $5.4 billion, and you still have to find the $15 million to pay for it. There is an obligation on the opposition: come clean with the Australian community. Here is the opposition's opportunity to say to us whether or not it supports the government's direction on these savings in the defence budget of $5.4 billion. It is simple: yes or no. And if it does not support them then it should tell us where it is going to get the money from—simple. Not too hard. Very simple. Just do it.

                                                            In terms of the military superannuation, let me say to you that the opposition, as we have just heard, have said—and there may be something which they do not quite understand here—that they would index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments in the same way as the age pension. Keep that in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition want to equate a superannuation benefit payment for work with an income support. They are trying to equate superannuation—a benefit paid to an employee as a result of their working life—with an income support measure such as the age pension.

                                                            Let me go through some detail. Over the 11 years of the previous Howard government, what did they do on the question of the indexation of military superannuation? It is a simple question, and the answer is zero, nought, nothing. They put in place the Podger review to review superannuation. From memory the Podger review gave its report to the then government in March or April of 2007. The government did not release it; they just refused to release the report. They thought, 'Just do the report, give people an idea that we are actually going to try to do something but, in fact, do nothing.'
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            What we did was proceed to release the review and then go on and do more work, and we have come to the conclusion that it is not appropriate for us to index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments and treat them the same as the age pension. We know it is very costly. What is more, the opposition know they cannot afford it. Despite statements by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow minister for veterans affairs and by this shadow minister they know it cannot be afforded. Their former finance minister

A warrant officer who retired in 2010 after 35 years service is estimated to receive a payment without commutation of approximately $54,000 per year. If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment—and 99.5 per cent of members have commuted the annual payment—then the lump sum would be around $270,000, in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $40,000 per year. What we are being asked to do here is equate that superannuation payment to the age pension. Are you serious?

If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment, then the lump sum would be around $390,000 in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $59,000 per year. Again, are you serious? Are you seriously expecting us, this government, the community, to equate a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year, indexed to

                                                            You know, as I know, that those people whose income falls below the threshold can get access, if they meet the appropriate service requirements, to the service pension at age 60 and to the age pension at age 65. Should any of these people, over time, find that their incomes have dropped or that they have made decisions around their lives which mean that their incomes have dropped, then they will get access to the age pension or the service pension, depending on their individual circumstances. I was not aware of this until recently but, in addition, since 1988, DFRDB members have been entitled to a nine per cent productivity benefit, which is available as a lump sum on retirement. So not only can they do the commutation but they also get a nine per cent lump sum productivity benefit on retirement.

                                                              But you are not upfront with the Australian community about how you are going to identify the savings to pay for it or how you are going to identify the savings to pay for the $5.4 billion worth of defence expenditure cuts which we have put into this budget. You have not explained that to us either. You have an obligation, when you go to these meetings, to be straight. The problem is that you are not. People are not silly. They are not going to be confused forever. There will come a day when they will ask you the vital questions and you will not be able to respond to them because you do not have an answer. It is very clear to me that, despite your protestations, in your heart of hearts and indeed, I bet, in the shadow finance minister's heart of hearts, the shadow Treasurer's heart of hearts and, I suspect, in the Leader of the Opposition's heart of hearts, you all agree with Senator Minchin. They agreed with him when they were in the Howard government as members of the cabinet and they agree with him today. Of that I have no doubt. It is just a proposition which is not sustainable.

The only commitment we have received out of you this morning is a commitment not about what you are going to do about the $5.4 billion worth of defence savings but a commitment—two commitments really—on leave travel entitlements and superannuation indexation for the DFRDB recipients. That is it. I say to you that you need to do a lot more to tell the Australian community about what you intend to do in both the Defence portfolio and the Veterans' Affairs portfolio.

I will just update that for the record. On budget night, the minister made much of the government's $17.4 million package to respond to the findings of the Campbell Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The review's recommendations were tabled by the minister in the House on Wednesday, 23 May. In that statement the minister indicated that 96 of the 108 recommendations were adopted. What he did not say was that the government has delayed the implementation of the major findings of the review until a later date, principally to save money.

                                                               confirmed that recommendations implementing compensation-offsetting reform and major changes to the review and appeal methodology have been delayed by a government decision not to spend any of the announced funding for a further two years. This means that a returned soldier, sailor or airman, or airwoman, will be forced to wait another two years for the government to implement findings fully endorsed by the ex-service community. Minister, why have these been delayed, why wasn't this announced earlier and what are the implications of this delay?

                                                                Further to the issue of superannuation, let me make it clear what the opposition has signed up to: $175 million over the forward estimates; a $1.7 billion fiscal cost over the forward estimates; and $6.2 billion in unfunded liabilities. Those opposite have not seen the connection, or are failing to recognise the connection, between this superannuation scheme and the scheme that other Commonwealth superannuation beneficiaries are on—that is, Commonwealth public servants. If there were to be a change to the indexation in the way in which the opposition subscribes to, as former Senator Minchin pointed out, there will inevitably be a flow-on to all Commonwealth public servants. The costs would be horrendous. It is something that I know the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer will have deep in their thoughts. This is a commitment that I do not think will be met.

The opposition is in no position to criticise the government on our commitment to review MRCA, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which was a Labor Party 2007 election commitment. We have implemented 96 of the 108 recommendations. It is worth pointing out again that, like on the indexation issue, when the opposition were in government they refused to commit to any review of MRCA to ensure it was meeting the needs of our service men and women. They refused to do it. They did virtually nothing for the veterans community in 11 years of government, and their words are not backed up. Now, I am afraid, they are simply playing the politics of it.
                                                                   </p>

The majority of the veterans affected by the methodology will benefit financially from the new methodology being applied rather than the current one. Any veteran to whom the current methodology applies between now and 1 July 2013 may still benefit from the new methodology when their case is reviewed. The retrospective reviews will commence six months after 1 July 2013—that is, from January 2014. No-one will be disadvantaged by the reviews. Indeed, the majority are expected to benefit by a retrospective adjustment to their compensation for the MRCA accepted conditions. Where the new methodologies apply retrospectively and produce a lower outcome, the current methodology, the existing MRCA compensation, will continue.
                                                                   </p>

                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">

The number of retrospective reviews required to be done will not increase after 1 July 2013, because the new methodologies apply to new decisions from that date. As of 1 July 2013, there will be about 1,600 to 1,800 decisions to be reviewed. Many of these reviews, as one would expect, will be complex—they will involve multiple assessments dating to 1 July 2004. Each assessment will have to be recalculated using the new methodology, and it is expected that it will take 2½ years to review all cases. It is not expected that there will be any need for additional medical reviews to allow the new methodology to be applied. The government provided funding to DVA for the conduct of these assessments.
                                                                   </p>

I make it clear that considerable preparatory work is necessary before DVA can implement the accepted recommendations with an implementation date of 1 July 2013 or later. For some initiatives, system changes are required. There are 20 recommendations that require legislative amendment, instruments and determinations. Implementation of the 53 recommendations involving improvements to benefits systems or processes is a substantial body of work for the department.
                                                                   </p>

The government has asked that further work be done and presented back to government in the 2014 budget, with a view to implementation from 1 July 2014. This is a significant and complex change associated with the appeals process. It is very important that enough time be allowed for consideration of all the issues so that the best possible process is available to those who need to have a primary decision review.
                                                                   </p>

It did not provide a solution to these issues. This work now needs to be done. It would not have been sensible to begin work until the government had made a decision in the 2012 budget to support recommendations 17.1 and 17.2. Do you want me to proceed with the advocacy model?

They are there to provide assistance to men and women in uniform who are currently serving personnel on what we can do for them: what their entitlements are; what they need to do if they are proposing to leave the Defence Force. We are also acutely aware of those people who have been wounded or are ill as a result of action or their service. We are most particularly aware of those people in rehabilitation and what we need to do to make sure that we maintain the requirements for them post their service life. This is all happening on bases around the country.

I did some work on this and it is something that I think the shadow minister would be interested in; it is something I have been talking about at

These are not people who have DFRDB or any entitlement to superannuation; these are people in uniform who, the bulk of them, are leaving the Australian Defence Force by the time they are 27. They are the people I am most concerned about.

But if you are a member of the Defence Force and you retire out of the Defence Force after two or three tours in Afghanistan, at age 25 or 26 or 27 or 28, then there is a real chance that you might disappear from us. We need to try to inculcate in these serving members the need to stay connected through the Defence Force associations and ex-service organisations such as the RSL so that we can make sure, should something go awry somewhere down the track, that we are looking after them. That is our commitment. I know it is a commitment that is shared by the opposition. Despite the differences we have, and I say this while the shadow minister for veterans' affairs adviser is here—he's a good bloke; he's all right—over issues such as DFRDB and DFRDB superannuation, we are aligned in making sure that we are supporting our veterans and our veterans' community. In conclusion, what I am concerned about is whether or not you support us, whether or not you support the government's proposed savings in this budget. At some time I expect you to tell us.

Whilst it is a long time coming, the government response to one particular initiative is of deep and growing concern. On 18 April the Prime Minister announced $6.5 million for the construction of the Anzac Interpretive Centre to ensure the new centre was up and running by November 2014. The Anzac centre is fully supported by the coalition and, I gather, by the government.

In its council meeting of 15 May this year it passed a resolution calling for funding security. The council's minutes state that presently the cost estimates for the planning, design and construction of the centre, based on the scoping advice of consultants, is potentially $9 million plus. To date the only confirmed funding for the project is $6.55 million, leaving $5.8 million for construction. A quantity surveyor has estimated the cost of construction at $8 million. The council advises that the construction of this building, from a project management perspective, is a risk. The government funding appears to be $2 million short of what is needed for the Prime Minister's 18 April 2012 commitment to be sustained. We also learned on Tuesday night that the scoping study into the project is yet to be completed and the government's final commitment is based on an old estimate of construction costs. Minister, can you give the community of Albany any commitment that the city will not be left saddled with the cost of completing the Anzac Interpretive Centre?

He works in native title and Josh and I have talked about this issue on a number of occasions. He talks about the challenges in relation to native title. Minister, I would like to ask a question in relation to this. I understand that back in 2008 it was estimated that, given the rate of resolution, it would take about 30 years to resolve the current and anticipated native title claims. In about 2009 I think the government made a number of reforms to actually promote a speedy resolution of those types of cases. I understand that in the budget there were some announcements in relation to institutional reform to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the judicial system, particularly native title claims. Can you provide information about that particular measure, the anticipated impact and the resolution of those claims? I am happy to relate that back to Josh and his organisation in Queensland.

I did understand the member for Blair was asking a question on a similar topic and thought it might be easiest to take both of them together. Absolutely, the government is confident that it can fully reconcile its support and recognition for the 20-year anniversary which comes this Sunday in celebration of the High Court decision in the Mabo case and then, of course, the Labor government's action to introduce the native title system—mind you we met with enormous opposition from those opposite. I did think that the very brief and fairly churlish comments in the House today indicated that some in the opposition still have an antipathy to native title. That is a shame, when 20 years on we can see that the system is working quite well.

That amount of money has been invested many, many times over in other Indigenous programs, which are also in this budget but which I have not yet been asked about—for example, the night patrols that are occurring across many communities in the Territory, and the investments in other justice programs which apply across all the country. The reason that this decision was taken is that we had a recommendation from the Skehill review looking at a range of matters in our courts. We had many, many representations from those involved in the native title system, and we have clear evidence in front of us that this system is working. We know how long it would take if we kept on the same trajectory that we were on—with the Native Title Tribunal itself estimating that the current cases could take at least another 30 years to be completed.

Why was the AFP forced to undertake this task and not Border Protection Command, as is obviously appropriate? What risk assessment has been done for illegal arrivals coming to Cocos Island, both for the Australian officers involved and for the asylum seekers themselves?

Where are the people being detained on Cocos Island and in what conditions are they being detained?

I think it is one that is supported by the shadow minister and by the shadow minister for immigration. I have had conversations with the shadow minister for immigration about that matter specifically. The AFP provides health and safety information and training to its employees. It provides AFP members with an understanding of potential health effects and the skills and knowledge that enable them to work safely. The Indian Ocean Territories Health Service services the community of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and is responsible for initial screening of irregular maritime arrivals.

I know that in his press release yesterday he said that it is disgraceful that this situation has been allowed to happen more than once. I should inform him that it happened more than once under the Howard government; it happened twice under the Howard government within a short period of time, so he should reflect upon that when making remarks like that. The Australian Federal Police had responsibility then at Cocos (Keeling) Island, as they do now.

Since 2009 the committee has been very interested in the application of unexplained wealth as a technique for targeting serious and organised crime. Unexplained wealth represents a relatively new form of criminal asset confiscation where serious and organised criminals who cannot account for their wealth could be held liable to forfeit it. The value of unexplained wealth provisions lies in its ability to undermine the business model of serious and organised crime. The effect is that it removes incentive for participation and puts in doubt the profits that could be otherwise recommitted into furthering other criminal endeavour.
                                                                                                  </p>

But during the bill's rather tortuous passage through the parliament it was so amended that the resulting piece of legislation providing for unexplained wealth became, in our opinion, seriously unworkable—unworkable certainly to the extent of law enforcement. With these provisions being established, which was very much at the vanguard of attacking serious and organised crime, not one prosecution has been mounted since the passage of this legislation. My committee has more recently conducted a review of the legislation, which I know you are aware of. For the purpose of these proceedings, I would like you to explain why you believe it is absolutely essential that we have national unexplained wealth laws and how you see that combating serious and organised crime.

The work that he and his committee did in the area of unexplained wealth is very important, and if we can get the support of the states and territories for some of the recommendations in that report to create a national unexplained wealth regime then its impact will be very significant. It will mean that we will seize more money off criminals, which will mean more money in the Proceeds of Crime Fund, which ultimately means more money for the budget, which is a good thing. As the member rightly points out, in March his committee released its report into its inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. It recommended a national approach to unexplained wealth laws to make it more effective than the current regime. That ultimately would require the referral of powers from state and territory jurisdictions. By way of background, the federal government enacted its own unexplained wealth legislation in 2010.

As the committee's report points out, there are significant differences and limitations in the way the state laws operate. There are also significant constitutional limitations on what the Commonwealth laws can achieve. They can only be used for offences against the Commonwealth. I agree—and I know that the Attorney-General agrees—that there are improvements that can be made in this area.

National laws will help the federal government and the states and territories. National laws would give organised crime nowhere to hide their assets. Why is this important? It is important, as the member knows, because organised crime is ultimately driven by money, and because it costs the Australian economy more than $15 billion a year. Take away their profits and it reduces the incentive to commit crime. Organised criminals are more afraid of having their wealth seized than they are of spending time in jail. That is why we need these powerful unexplained wealth laws.
                                                                                                   </p>

It effectively reverses the onus of proof. It means that people have to prove their wealth was obtained through legitimate sources rather than law enforcement being forced to prove that it was not. Over the past two years we have more than doubled the value of the assets seized, from about $18 million to more than $40 million. So far this year we have almost doubled it again, seizing $75 million. We are taking mansions, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, yachts and so forth, which takes away the incentive for criminals to commit crimes. Just like in the story of

It means the Mr Bigs have to prove their wealth was obtained legally, which makes it easier to confiscate their assets. This makes it one of the most effective ways to tackle organised crime. That is why we will be pursuing this issue with the states and territories with a view to creating national laws. To tackle organised crime we have to hit criminals on the street and at the border, but we also have to do it at the hip pocket. These new laws will help to hit criminals where it really hurts—in their hip pocket.

In relation to the budget cuts, from previous budgets, of $58.1 million and the fact that air cargo is going to increase by almost 45 per cent over the forward estimates in this budget, I am wondering if the minister can inform the House what percentage of air and sea cargo is screened and what percentage is physically examined. Has the reduction in air cargo screening resulted in more illegal contraband being smuggled undetected through customs? Referring to the Attorney's media statement this morning on tobacco smuggling, will the minister be able to outline whether this measure will come with additional funding for Customs to screen cargo so they can stop illegal tobacco being smuggled through our borders?

Can the minister also confirm whether the $4½ million in funding that the government has committed to Task Force Polaris is additional funding, or are the agencies involved expected to find this money in their existing budgets? If that is additional funding, could he point out where in the budget that funding is to be found?

I cannot provide to the House additional information on this at this time because it is before the courts, but I ask the shadow minister to reflect very seriously and very carefully on the information that I have just provided.
                                                                                                     </p>

When they seized the weapons they found information at the scenes in

The advice of Customs is that indeed the weapons that were linked to these documents were illegally imported. They were illegally imported under the Howard government. So it is to put that information into perspective when understanding this issue. This was at a time when 100 per cent of international mail was X-rayed. It shows the limitations of X-raying. In both these cases of the Glocks and military rifles, X-raying was done. That is why I have said that finding metal gun parts in a box of metal machinery is very difficult. You need to know what you are looking for. That is why I asked for advice from law enforcement agencies. Their advice was that intelligence is the key to seizing drugs or to seizing guns. That is proven by the facts.
                                                                                                     </p>

I have got for him the following information that he might find instructive. In 2007, the last year of the Howard government, Customs inspected six million air parcels and detected 870 parcels that contained drugs or other prohibited items. In 2011, Customs inspected 1½ million parcels and, by using profiling and intelligence to target the right parcels, they seized 1,741 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items. In other words, Customs are now seizing double what they were in air cargo under the Howard government. They are seizing double the amount of illegal goods that they were when the member was in government, and that is because of the use of intelligence and targeting. The more intelligence that law enforcement agencies have the more drugs and the more guns they seize, whether it is on the street or at the border. That is why I then asked officials that report to me whether in the budget we should be increasing investment in screening, as the shadow minister proposes, or investing in intelligence. They all said we should be investing in intelligence. That is why I have established an intelligence and targeting team inside Customs, because that is the way to seize guns. It is the same model that we have applied to drugs and it comes with a Customs officer who is now embedded inside the

We are, of course, concerned when any illicit product is coming across our borders. I need to put on the record that we do not share the view that the tobacco industry has that this is a huge problem in Australia, but any amount of illegal product coming in is obviously a concern. It is a concern both on the health front because people smoke this product and because it is essentially defrauding Australian taxpayers of money that would otherwise be paid as excise to the government and be provided for in the budget.

The question went directly to whether or not there are any additional resources being provided. No, there are not for this particular initiative. The same work that is done in detecting illicit tobacco will continue but we will be able to enforce a much stricter regime and harsher penalties, including that those involved in this illicit trade could end up in jail for up to 10 years. It is about having a proper disincentive and us tackling tobacco across all fronts.

I have been through Customs warehouses and they all smell of tobacco as you go through. There was mention of the report that had been prepared. It was paid for by the tobacco industry but it was done by an independent body. If the Attorney does not believe the scope of the activity as outlined within that report then would she care to outline to the House how serious she believes this problem is. How serious is this crime in Australia and what are the costs to the Australian community? If they do differ from what is contained in that report, could she let us know how.

I do not have the table in front of me, but I can provide the details that have been made public in the past—and we are happy to make them public—of Customs seizures. They do continue to identify tobacco that is being brought illegally into Australia and we, of course, prosecute people for doing that. The changes that have been announced go to what penalties apply when that happens.
                                                                                                        </p>

It may well be a dispute that is inevitably going to continue. By its nature, illicit trade means that you cannot always perfectly measure how much is being brought in, but we have a range of different things for measuring it. We have Customs material and household drug surveys. All of them show a far smaller incidence of this than the tobacco industry's own reports. I have said on the record many times before, and I am not ashamed to say it again, that the tobacco industry do not have a good record when it comes to the way they use data and research. In fact, they have a shameful record. So it is fair enough, I think, for me, the government and the public to take with a grain of salt this sort of data that they rely on.
                                                                                                        </p>

It is in their interests and in the Commonwealth's interests to make sure that, if tobacco is going to be bought and consumed in Australia, the proper taxes are paid and that the proper health warnings are in place. Our government is determined to do everything it can to reduce the number of people who want to participate in that activity.

You are also 24 times more likely to be in jail before you turn 17 and almost 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care. It found that, of the 105,000 homeless people in Australia, 50,000 are under the age of 24, and our out-of-home care system established to look after our most vulnerable children is not in good repair. Children in out-of-home care have increased by 51.5 per cent since 2005. We are not sure why this is happening in Australia, because Australia collects no comprehensive data on these children.

An appropriately resourced National Children's Commissioner will give Australian kids a voice at the national level and bring attention to issues of neglect, abuse and discrimination. An effectively resourced national advocate for children will offer a powerful focus for hearing children's voices, especially on the subjects of youth justice, child protection, Indigenous health outcomes and homelessness.

It will be able to assist in and drive law reform and policy development and develop consultation mechanisms that encourage the participation of children. An effective commissioner will collaborate and coordinate with the community and business sectors to develop and strengthen community understanding of the issues and experiences of children, and have the power to intervene in court proceedings involving the rights of children and young people.

In the past there have been too many instances where a lack of coordinated response by governments and their departments have allowed children and young people to suffer. Youth homelessness and the health and education of Indigenous young people are two obvious examples. We really need bipartisan support for the role of National Children's Commissioner to ensure that the outcomes for children are effective. The commissioner will, of course, have guaranteed independence from government and it should be a matter of common ground to support a properly resourced commission.

                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                           As the member mentioned, it is something that I also have a strong and long personal attachment to from my position as the shadow minister for children and youth many years ago. More than 10 years ago, in fact, we first announced a policy proposing a National Children's Commissioner, and it gives me great pleasure that, in the budget, we have now dedicated finances to be able to make this a reality. It is an unusual situation to have an extra, separate budget line item rather than simply an increase to the Human Rights Commission's budget. That is because we are conscious of the issues that the member has raised: to make sure that we have sufficient resources and dedicated resources. I know the commission is very excited about this additional formal responsibility being added to its remit.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           We have proposed the legislation that will be able to establish this, and though we have not yet had an indication we hope that we will have an indication of support from the opposition. We will make it clear that a National Children's Commissioner has certain responsibilities and does not have others. Those certain responsibilities are to make sure that there is a particular focus on those who, as the member for Fremantle has mentioned, are vulnerable and disadvantaged. Many, many children in Australia have wonderful lives. When you look around the world, Australia is one of the best countries for a child to be born in; however, there are children in Australia who do not get the benefits of that. This commissioner will have particular responsibilities to make sure that those disadvantaged groups in particular are focused on.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           I also flag that, unlike other proposals that have been floating around—for example, the proposal by the Greens party—our proposal is that the commissioner will not have a complaint-handling role dealing with individual children, nor will the commissioner take on child protection matters or family law matters for individuals, nor act as a legal guardian. It is important to emphasise that there are other bodies that fulfil those roles. We want this to be an opportunity to advocate for systematic reforms and improvements for children across disadvantaged groups. It is very important that we match the responsibilities to the resources available. An undertaking which required the National Children's Commissioner take on those additional roles would, of course, need to be resourced well above the current proposal, and would duplicate many of the responsibilities for children that lie with other agencies.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           I am very excited that this is in the budget. I think it is an important step forward for children. I look forward to having an indication—hopefully sometime soon—from the opposition that is something that they will support. There will, of course, be a debate in the parliament when the legislation is introduced and, after that, an opportunity for us to recruit and employ the first ever National Children's Commissioner.

That information told us that Customs reports a boat arrival to the minister's office within about six hours, on average, and that the average time it took the minister's office to issue a publicity release was just over 15 hours—about double that time.
                                                                                                           </p>

Has Customs ever formally requested that the minister's office not issue a public media release until the boat has been intercepted, or is it up to the minister's office as to when this release is issued?
                                                                                                           </p>

I want an explanation as to why that would happen.
                                                                                                           </p>

Who is notified? What is the chain of communication and, ultimately, who gives final approval for the release? Is it the minister who gives this final approval?

The release is not issued until the boat has been intercepted and the information in that release can be confirmed. From time to time, we will be told that a boat has been detected, and that from the air it can be determined that there might be 30 or 40 people on the boat, but the release is not issued until an interception has occurred and we can confirm those numbers to provide the information that you receive in the press release. That is, I think, the appropriate course of action to make sure that the information that is provided to you and to the media is as accurate as it could possibly be.

It is my name at the top and it is my obligation to make sure that the information is accurate. I cannot speak for previous ministers, but I am assuming that that is the practice that they adopted in the past: to make sure that a statement is issued only once the boat has been intercepted and all of that information can be properly and accurately provided.

I know the minister is very familiar with my electorate, having himself grown up there. In fact, his mother and father are still constituents of mine; hopefully happy constituents. Apart from being the most multicultural electorate in the whole country, one of the things that really distinguishes my electorate is the number of families. The minister will no doubt recall some 12 years ago areas at the centre of my electorate, particularly around Cabramatta, were very much the destination or the distribution points for drugs and illegal firearms. As a matter of fact, the communities were terrorised in those days by organised crime gangs as they ran these illegal operations around the streets of south-west Sydney.

I have a fair understanding about what our police are doing out there. I am wondering whether the minister could outline to the House how these weapons are coming onto our streets? The fact is that there have been 24 shootings and it is having such an effect on local families, who want to bring up their children in safety. Having these headlines appear out there is something which is certainly deleterious for the whole community. Minister, if you would outline to the House your view about where these weapons are coming from?

A lot of these guns are 10, 20 or 30 years old and they do not have a use-by date. Two of the guns that have been seized in the last year were more than 100 years old and are still working.

The most recent example of this came just yesterday. New South Wales police reported eight pistols and eight rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, stolen from a property near Baradine in the electorate of the member for Parkes.

Australia already has some of the toughest gun laws in the world, but there are a number of areas where we can improve upon them. I am working very closely with

IBIS does ballistics analysis of firearms that are seized from criminals. It is the sort of testing that can link firearms to previous crimes. At the moment New South Wales and the Federal Police have the system, but it does not exist across the rest of the country. I believe, and Mike Gallacher believes, in the need to roll it out nationwide. There is a lot more we need to do. Police need intelligence on who the shooters are, where the weapons are and what they are being used for. That means breaking down the wall of silence, the fear that exists in our communities of dobbing somebody in, the fear of retribution. It means making weapons harder to steal and easier for them to be seized by law enforcement. It also means tougher firearms laws and the rollout across the country of tracing technology like IBIS. Delivering these reforms will require us to all work together, and I am determined to get it done. Over the next few weeks, I will be travelling the country and meeting with police ministers to make sure that we deliver the reforms that we have to when we meet in June. That is what the people of Western Sydney expect of us and that is what we must deliver.
