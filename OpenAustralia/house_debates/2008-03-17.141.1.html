       <p>
        I wish to speak about the policing crisis on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        and to speak in support of District Inspector Gordon Charteris. Very recently, there was an important meeting on the Mornington Peninsula of police from throughout that area and the community. The message from these very brave police was: ‘We believe in our community, we support our community but we need the support of additional resources.’ They do a fantastic job, but what is most important is that they were faced with a policing crisis. They dealt with that issue: they stood up in public, they declared the need for support and they did so at the risk of losing their careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, District Inspector Gordon Charteris stood up and laid out the case for more policing on the peninsula. He is correct, he is courageous and he needs to be supported. There is a very real chance that he will be subject to retribution from the Victorian government. This cannot stand and it will not be allowed to happen. We will fight it and work with the local police on every front to ensure that somebody as courageous as Gordon Charteris is protected, that his message is listened to and that additional police resources for Hastings, Mornington and Rosebud are provided. Above all else, if our democracy means anything at a local level it means that courageous people such as Gordon Charteris should be supported and protected. The Victorian government must guarantee that his career is safe.
