        I rise today to congratulate our latest young star from the

        , Fletcher Pilon, a 14-year-old singer-songwriter from Wamberal in my electorate who, this week, won
        <i>

        <i>

        <i>

        </i>
        . Fletcher's story is truly inspirational, not only because of his incredible achievement in clinching the $250,000 price, not even because of his obvious amazing voice or the beautiful melodies of his songs, but because of Fletcher's courage in telling his story of how he tragically lost his brother, Banjo, after he was struck by a car while skateboarding with friends. The track
        <i>

        from the Banjo
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        was dedicated to his much loved brother. Fletcher reprised this tune on
        <i>

        <i>

        <i>

        </i>
        , and he had the judges in tears and the audiences on their feet. I know that his success has struck a chord right across our community, and the Central Coast has come together in a show of great strength to support Fletcher, his sister, Gabbi, and his parents, Jilly and Mic. This includes working on a project to help build a skate park in Banjo's honour in Wamberal.

        government have already done some great work on this initiative which is expected to cost between $200,000 and $500,000. There is also a community-driven fundraising page that is building more support every day. I know that, together as a community and together with the member for Dobell, we will keep working to find ways to make his become a reality. In the meantime, let's celebrate this extraordinary achievement by Fletcher Pilon. He is an extraordinary talent and a young man with an incredible future.
