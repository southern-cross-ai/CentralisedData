        I rise to once again bring to the attention of the House something that I found very interesting. In today's

        </i>
        senior journalist Nigel Adlam uncovered new interruptions that threaten to create further delays to the delivery of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        in Darwin and Palmerston. Mr Adlam reported that: 'The roll-out of the National Broadband Network in the Territory could be delayed for several months.' He further claimed that the National Secretary of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, Peter Tighe, warned that, due to the skills shortage, the rollout of the National Broadband Network in Darwin could be delayed. Mr Tighe said that he expected that, due to the inability of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        contractors to compete with mining companies for skilled workers, households across Darwin and Palmerston would not be connected to the NBN until at least February 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable member: After the election.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the election. This is despite construction allegedly commencing in my electorate over 18 months ago, in September 2011. The average time for construction to connection estimated by the Labor government's own figures is meant to be 12 months. Something is wrong with these figures here. The delays that Mr Tighe forecasted would remain unless NBN Co. were to provide the rollout contracts to contractors that have the ability to 'bring in workers from overseas'.
       </p>
       <p>
        What Mr Adlam has exposed today is only further chaos and instability plaguing the Gillard Labor government and the broader labour movement. It beggars belief that, in the same week the Prime Minister is parading a crackdown on 457s and the skilled migration program, the national secretary of one of her own unions is campaigning for skilled workers to be brought in from overseas. Go figure! I would be interested to know whether Minister Snowdon, a fellow Territorian, agrees with the calls for more 457 visas to roll out the NBNâ€”or does he agree with the Prime Minister? The Gillard Labor government are in chaos. They cannot even agree with their own unions and their skilled migration policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Darwin and Palmerston tell me that the instability and uncertainty wreaking havoc through the Gillard Labor government are resonating throughout the Solomon community. For the people of my electorate, 14 September cannot come soon enough. It is not fair that the mums and dads feel so insecure about their children's future because of the Gillard Labor government's instability and inability to govern. So, on 14 September, the people of my electorate have a clear choice: a vote for Labor will ensure that the Gillard Labor government will be returned, ensuring more waste, more debt and more deficit, or they have the choice of a coalition government, which will provide hope, reward and opportunity.
