        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what is fair about giving very high income earners a tax cut in tonight's budget, with someone earning $300,000 receiving $2,600 in tax cuts every year while a typical family loses $5,000 a year?

           How fair is it to make promises to the Australian people without having the funds to pay for them? How fair is it to deny ordinary working Australians the ability to buy an investment property and claim a net rental loss against their income?

           And they are scoffing. They are all scoffing, including the ones who own investment properties—they are also scoffing. They are scoffing at the people who, after the first year of a Labor government, will not be able to do what they have done.

             What their policy does is slam the door shut on aspiration. Let us talk about fairness and their negative gearing proposal. Under their proposal, a person earning $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000 a year—average earnings are $80,000 a year—will not be able to deduct a net rental loss against their personal income. They will not be able to deduct the net loss of an investment in shares or in a business they have started to get going to stop being an employee and to be independent. They might have wanted to go into the trucking business. They might have wanted to be an owner-driver. Of course, the Labor Party has other ways of putting owner-drivers out of business.

             They had put 50,000 of them out of business until the coalition put them back into business. That is what Labor wants to do: slam the door shut on that aspiration. That is the absolute, inevitable effect of their policy. But if somebody has $50,000 or $100,000 of investment income from dividends, from interest or from rents, they will be able to negatively gear. Under the Labor Party's policy—
