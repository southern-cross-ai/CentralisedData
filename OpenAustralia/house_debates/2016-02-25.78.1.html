        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on how the government's defence white paper will reinforce the vital role that the defence forces play in the communities and economies of rural and regional Australia, and especially in electorates like Durack?

         I thank the member for Durack and I thank her for her interest in defence matters. I know this is a very exciting day for her community—for the communities of Derby and Exmouth, where there will be great benefits from the defence white paper. I know she has already spoken to a couple of her local mayors, who are very excited by today's announcement and how it will play out in her community.

           <p>
            I am sure members opposite, like members on this side, appreciate the extraordinary long and proud history that regional Australia has with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            . If you travel anywhere in regional Australia, you will find avenues of honour. If you travel to our small country towns, you will see the memorial boards in our halls. You will see active
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
             RSL
            </a>
            clubs. The regions right throughout Australia have played an extraordinarily important role and have paid a very heavy price in the defence of our nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as our regional communities remember that service of the past, they are also looking to the future and are very proud to play a role in meeting our nation's future security needs. And the Turnbull-Joyce government is delivering a real plan for our nation's security, and it is backed by real funding. As the Prime Minister himself has indicated here today, although it is not the primary purpose of the Australian Defence Force to be a major driver of economic prosperity and jobs growth, it certainly is. Our communities are very proud to host the men and women in uniform, and we look forward to further social and economic benefits which will flow from the defence white paper announced today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding some of the key announcements included in the white paper, if you look around

             New South Wales
            </a>
            and some of the regional areas, I know the member for Gilmore is very proud of the role that her community plays with the

            90 troop-lift helicopters based at Nowra. They will be supported by new facilities, including new training platforms for Navy and Army aircrew. The member for Paterson is also a very strong advocate for the Defence Force, and he is also going to be pleased with

            , the member for Solomon is an outspoken advocate for defence resources in her community. In the decade to 2025-26, around $8 billion will be spent upgrading defence facilities in the Northern Territory. In

            , in the member for Grey's electorate, there will be upgrades to the Cultana Training Area and the Woomera Range Complex. In Tasmania, from now until 2025-26, around $300 million will be invested in upgrading defence facilities. In Queensland, we are very pleased with upgrades to
