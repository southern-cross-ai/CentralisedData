        Earlier in this chamber I had the opportunity to reflect on the appropriation bills in the second reading debate. I want to add something very important to that contribution—specifically something that was announced in the budget two weeks ago. The Treasurer joined me in Adelaide last week to announce that the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and Andrew Steiner Education Centre would receive a $2½ million capital grant from the Commonwealth to assist with the very important work that they do in Holocaust awareness education and remembrance.

        Andrew Steiner is the great pioneer of this institution. He's a constituent of mine. He is 87 years old. He was born in 1933—a

        boy—the year that Hitler came to power under the Nazi regime in Germany. He obviously didn't have a childhood like we understand a childhood to be. It was one of fear, terror and murder. Thankfully, he is a survivor, but of course he and many other people lost six million relatives—their fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles—and friends in that most disgraceful and disgusting period of history. It's beyond question that this is the most appalling event in the history of humanity. Nonetheless, as we say, those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it. As much as it's such a disgusting chapter, it's vitally important that young people in particular are aware of what happened in Europe during that regime.

        The Adelaide Holocaust Museum is about to open on 9 November. Nine November is the commemoration of Kristallnacht, which was the awful terror that occurred throughout many major cities in Germany when Jewish businesses and Jewish people were attacked. Part of that commemoration will be the opening of this museum and centre.

        The Catholic archdioceses in Adelaide have been very good to donate the building where the museum is located. We had the archbishop with us last week. I put on the record the support of the archdioceses of Adelaide in providing that space. This was very much an initiative that initially was quite underresourced financially. There was a lot of passion from those associated with it. We have a very small Jewish community in

        , probably numbering about 1,200. Obviously in cities like Melbourne and Sydney numerically it's much larger. Of course, the Adelaide Jewish community has the same passion as any Jewish community. They have done a fantastic job in getting the museum to the point it is at now.
       </p>
       <p>
        This $2½ million commitment from the Commonwealth will be transformative of their ability to engage with students and bring student groups in. The state government has agreed to put Holocaust education into the year 10 curriculum in South Australia. That will mean that schools have the ability to deliver that education program as part of year 10. Of course we want to see that culminate in a visit to the museum.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not many survivors left now. Mr Steiner is now 87 years old, having been born in 1933. We don't have much time left with people who actually witnessed what occurred and can explain in their own words to the next generation what happened. For as long as he has breath in his lungs, he will be engaging in that. He's so passionate about ensuring that there is an awareness of what happened and that it contributes to our humanity. Even after he is gone we will have an asset in Adelaide that means that for a long time into the future—hopefully, in perpetuity—we will be educating our young people about the most horrendous chapter of human history and in so doing ensure that it is never repeated.
