        I rise today to speak of the devastation to crops, orchards and vineyards in the Riverland that occurred recently. On the afternoon and evening of Friday, 11 November, a severe supercell thunderstorm passed through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Victoria, producing damaging winds, golf-ball-sized hailstones and heavy rain. Whilst there was damage to property across both states, one of the worst-hit regions was the Riverland, and there was extensive damage, causing harm to growers' livelihoods. Reports indicate there could be up to $200 million worth of crop losses and property damage across the region, with wine grapes, stone fruit, almonds and citrus crops particularly hard-hit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The damage scar from the thunderstorm extended from Taylorville, near Waikerie, through Woolpunda, Barmera, Monash, Berri, Lyrup,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and out to Yamba. People in these areas have lived through the millennium drought and are dealing with low commodity prices. Many growers were looking forward to bumper crops but are now faced with almost complete economic loss. I visited the region following the weather event, and it is simply devastating. Ripe fruit is rotting on the ground. Vines have been stripped. Others are on the ground. A recovery centre has been established, and counsellors at the Rural Financial Counselling Service are facilitating damage assessments for farmers. This is a resilient community. It was tested during the millennium drought and it is being tested again.
