        I rise today to talk about the importance of Defence Force cadets in our local community but especially 40 Army Cadet Unit based at Noarlunga. On 31 October this year I had the privilege to attend their special dinner, which I was invited to by the president of the mess committee, Ryan Lindenberger. He was a lovely young man who was a great host indeed. That night was about showing some of the young people involved in the Army cadets exactly what it is like to attend a formal dinner in the Defence Force. They were all dressed up and looked very smart indeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also gave me the opportunity to speak to a number of the young people who were part of it and hear about the wider activities that they do as part of the Army cadets. These young people I spoke to before and after dinner were incredibly impressive young people. I would like to congratulate Paul Langtry, who is the captain and who puts in a lot of effort, along with his team, including Lieutenant Renee Groffen, Mr Robert Byrne, Mr Andrew Ware, Mr Desman Dalton, Mrs Leanne Ware, Mr Michael Jarrett, Madeline Jarrett-Graham,

        and, as I mentioned, Ryan Lindenberger, who all did a lot of work for this dinner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Broadly, the Army Cadet Corps is about developing an interest in the Army and its traditions. I did hear from some of these young people an interest in joining the Army. The statistics say that a large proportion of people that are involved in Army cadets, Navy cadets and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        cadets, because their passion is ignited while being involved as young people, do go on to serve in the Defence Force. This is really important. The corps encourage cadets to continue to do military service; develop a foundation of knowledge and discipline; develop qualities of leadership, self-discipline, self-reliance and initiative; and provide training that may contribute to the Army common induction training.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I saw there was an impressive group of young people who were developing exactly those things: leadership skills, self-discipline, self-reliance and initiative. Even if they do not go on to serve in the

        , those skills, the skills they are developing there as part of being an Army cadet, will serve them very well into the future. I commend the work done by all the Army and Defence Force cadets, the volunteers, the captain and the students.
