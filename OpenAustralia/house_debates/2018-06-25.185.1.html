        Last week, Kunyung Primary School in

        , in my electorate, hosted Healthy Tuckshop Day. Healthy Tuckshop Day is a national day which is in its second year. It's an initiative of My School Connect, who run the Tuckshop Revolution, and it is aimed at encouraging schools to get involved with the healthy tuckshop movement and celebrating those that do. My state counterpart, the Hon.

        , and I joined the students, Principal Kim Jackson, Julia from My School Connect, Tanya from Funch and Rosa from Aumra Yoga to discuss health and wellbeing, but, particularly, healthy eating habits. I am extremely proud of Kunyung Primary School for being a Healthy Tuckshop Day host this year and certainly saw a difference in the attitudes of the students towards eating healthily from when I was at school. For example, when I was at school all you got was Sunny Boys, lollies and all the other good things like pies and sausage rolls. What you get in canteens these days is a lot better compared to what I got at school. Mandy, from the tuckshop, signed the Healthy Tuckshop Day pledge. We know that healthy eating can make a difference with a child's education, attention span and so forth, so it's important to promote healthy eating at schools. I was very pleased to take part in Healthy Tuckshop Day with Kunyung Primary School, who are playing a leading role in promoting healthy eating initiatives, bringing an increased focus on health and wellbeing into Dunkley.
