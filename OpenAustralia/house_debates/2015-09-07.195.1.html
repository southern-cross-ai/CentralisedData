        I would like to pay tribute to one of Tasmania's most notable educators and advocates for women's rights, Mollie Campbell-Smith, who died on 7 July at the age of 98. Mrs Campbell-Smith was educated in Devonport and Launceston before attending the University of Melbourne, where she graduated with a bachelor of science. She then graduated with a diploma of education from the

         Methodist Ladies' College
        </a>
        in Launceston in the early 1950s and continued to teach and mentor at the school until her retirement in 1986.
       </p>
