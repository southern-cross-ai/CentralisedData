        This week is not only the last sitting week for parliamentarians but, for Queensland students, the last week of term 1, which can only mean one thing: Easter is now just a few days away. To celebrate Easter this year, I was proud to launch the first Oxley Easter colouring-in competition. The competition was open to early childhood centres in Goodna,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redbank_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Redbank Plains
        </a>
        and the Centenary suburbs, with over 100 entries received. I was amazed to see just how enthusiastically children, early childhood centres and their early childhood educators embraced the competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        With many fantastic and colourful entries received, the judging of this competition could have been done only by certified experts, and my special thanks go to Ann Egan and Mrs Anne O'Shea, from the Inala Pensioners League; Mrs Margaret Mullins, from the South West Progress Association; and Marilyn Thurtell, from the

        The talents of young people in Oxley don't stop there. At the beginning of this month I was thrilled to launch the 2018 Oxley Electorate Spirit of Anzac Award at host school

        </a>
        , alongside hardworking principal Mr Tom Beck, student leaders, President of the Redbank Plains
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-Branch Mrs Florence Scott and Secretary of the Redbank RSL Sub-Branch Mr Gary Gibson. Now in its second year, this competition is open to students in year 11 throughout the Oxley electorate, who are invited to submit a short essay, a poem or a piece of artwork on what the spirit of Anzac means to them. After feedback from students last year, the person judged to be awarded first prize will receive a new Apple iPad.
       </p>
       <p>
        A selection committee consisting of representatives from the hardworking local RSL sub-branches will select the most worthy recipient to be awarded first place, along with five other highly commended awards. Entry for students is now open, and the closing date for entries has now been extended to Tuesday, 17 April. The recipient, along with five other highly commended entries, will be announced in the lead-up to Anzac Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that Anzac Day holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians as we pay our respects to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country. This is clear to see from some of the entries already received and also from last year's competition, where the entries were amazing in their detail and commitment. Here is a small excerpt from last year's recipient, Mr Sam Wallace, from
