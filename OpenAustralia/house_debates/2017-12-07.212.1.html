        On 14 November I attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day" rel="nofollow">
         A Day
        </a>
        for Shay at

         Panania North Public School
        </a>
        . In March this year Shayanne Ashcroft, a student at Panania North Public School, tragically lost her life to type 1 diabetes. Demonstrating extraordinary strength and stoicism, her family have established an annual charity day in her honour, with two main objectives: firstly, to assist and support parents and visitors who make use of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU" rel="nofollow">
         ICU
        </a>
        hostel at the Sydney's Children's Hospital; and secondly, to create awareness and educate children and parents of schools on diabetes and its symptoms. The day involved children from the school wearing purple and donating an item that will be used to stock and replenish the cupboards at the ICU hostel, and also the opening of the outdoor library in Shay's honour in the grounds of Panania North Public School. I acknowledge Louise Anthony and all of Shay's family for their incredible efforts after suffering through such an extraordinarily tragic year. I also acknowledge the principal of Panania North Public School, Samantha Loveridge, for her ongoing leadership.

        On 14 November I attended the Clubs New South Wales southern region meeting at Masos in my electorate. Scores of clubs from around southern Sydney were represented, and there was a very interesting discussion about the role of clubs in our community and how much clubs put back by supporting our local sporting teams, charitable endeavours and so on. It was great to see my friend Ian Manley, the president of Masos, there hosting so many people from all around Sydney, and also Michael Free, who is both the president of Club Rivers, one of the largest clubs in the Banks electorate, and also president of the southern districts region of ClubsNSW. Our local clubs contribute a great deal in supporting grassroots activity and I certainly thank them for that contribution.

        On 19 September, I attended the St Joseph's Riverwood Sports Club presentation. The club participates in a wide range of sports, including cricket, netball, tee-ball, Oztag and touch football. I was able to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards to Christian Callen, for cricket, to

        , for Oztag, to Madison Jarvis, for netball, and to Isabella Bottaro, for tee-ball. It was great to be able to provide those certificates on the day. I would like to congratulate the players, coaches and managers on a very successful yearâ€”in particular club president Matt Carr, who has been involved for many years in St Joseph's Riverwood. It is a very tight-knit and close group of people who are involved in the St Joseph's Riverwood Sports Club and I thank them for their contribution to our community.
