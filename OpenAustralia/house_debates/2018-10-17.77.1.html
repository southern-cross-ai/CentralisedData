        My question is for the Minister for the Environment. I refer to reports that last night, when the minister was told that the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Kiribati" rel="nofollow">
         President of Kiribati
        </a>
        was in Australia to deliver a message on climate change, the environment minister told the former president:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know why you’re here. It is for the cash. For the Pacific it’s always about the cash. I have my chequebook here. How much do you want?
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister deny saying those words to the former President of one of Australia's Pacific neighbours and one of the nations most affected by climate change and sea level rise in the world?

        <p>
         Today I received a letter from Senator Dodson with his recollection of a conversation. I was very concerned that President Tong, who was in that meeting—actually it was a gathering at a restaurant where I stumbled across this group and went over to introduce myself to Senator Dodson, who I classify as a friend of mine. Some friend, I have to say. I'm very concerned that President Tong has been offended in any way; I believe he's not here anymore. I have spoken to Senator Dodson and asked him if he was able to provide me with a contact member for President Tong, because I 100 per cent disagree with what he has said was the conversation. What I did say is that the Pacific is a very good friend and neighbour to Australia. In fact, that's exactly what I said to President Tong last night.
