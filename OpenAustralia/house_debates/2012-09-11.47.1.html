        . What has the government done to help vulnerable people access housing and to reduce homelessness in Australia? How has the government partnered with states and territories to deliver real reform to housing and are there any impediments to this partnership in the future?

         I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her ongoing interest in this very important area of social policy. The government knows that there are too many Australians who are homeless, there are too many people sleeping rough, too many mums and their kids sleeping in cars and too many teenagers couch surfing. That is why the Labor government has been reducing homelessness and has made reducing homelessness a national priority. It is why we have invested an unprecedented $5 billion into support for homeless services and programs since 2008. We also invested $20 billion in making housing more affordable, including $6 billion in social housing. This has meant that construction workers and small businesses could stay afloat and, indeed, thrive during the global financial crisis. But just as importantly it has meant that we had 20,000 new homes for those people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. It was a very important investment. Through our efforts we have made a direct financial contribution since 2008 into one in every 20 homes constructed in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         In tough fiscal times, we are still committed. We are still committed to making a difference. We are still committed to cutting homelessness. However, this partnership is with states and territories and they must do their part.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked if there are any impediments to cutting the rate of homelessness in this country. This is not helped by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government increasing rents on pensioners and veterans in public housing. It is not helped by the Victorian government cutting funding to social housing advocacy and support programs. Indeed, it is not helped by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
          Campbell Newman
         </a>
         and the Queensland government axing the Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service and cutting front-line jobs which provide valuable assistance to more than 80,000 households annually in Queensland. Sadly, this valuable community service will close its doors in 24 locations around Queensland next month. Removing these services will, indeed, increase the risk of homelessness for thousands of Queenslanders.
        </p>

         The member for

         </a>
         has said that Campbell Newman's decision was courageous. Campbell Newman himself has said he has the support of the Leader of the Opposition,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , in his approach to cutting services and cutting front-line staff. Make no mistake, these essential services are needed. These jobs being cut will hinder our most vulnerable. This is just a dress rehearsal. This is just a warm-up act for if ever Tony Abbott became Prime Minister of this country.
