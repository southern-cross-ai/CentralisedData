        In December last year I sent out a community survey to my constituents to give them an opportunity to raise the issues that matter to them. The results highlight the stark reality of what we already know: people of the outer western suburbs of Sydney are being let down and forgotten by state and federal Liberal governments. Despite people winding down for Christmas, hundreds of people filled in the survey, and I'd like to thank them for their feedback. The issue that was highlighted most was, not unsurprisingly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . Just today I was contacted by Mrs Polglase, who raised concerns about the connection of her landline under the NBN. It has not worked properly for over a month. She's concerned about her 90-year-old husband and how quickly she could contact emergency services if they are needed. I've spoken multiple times in this chamber about the problems that the people in my electorate have faced with the NBN, but the comments of Mrs Polglase and many, many survey respondents really drive home the level of dissatisfaction that's felt in my electorate. It is beyond well overdue that the government finally listens to the people, admits its failings and fixes the mess.

        Another matter raised is the planning and building of the Western Sydney Airport at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgerys_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Badgerys Creek
        </a>
        . Ninety-eight per cent of survey respondents said the airport should be serviced by a train line when it opens, despite the reticence of state and federal governments to make any commitment to fund such infrastructure. The same numbers agreed that the road and other infrastructure should be built now and 96 per cent wanted local people to have a percentage of the jobs at the airport. The government must immediately show that it has a plan for how it can operate the airport in a way that actually benefits our community. The residents of Sydney's outer suburbs are fed up with being left behind. My office is regularly contacted by commuters who find it impossible to obtain legal parking spots within a reasonable distance of train stations like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmondson_Park" rel="nofollow">

        and Glenfield, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        , a station which has no lift, little parking and few regular bus services. When it's impossible to find an appropriate parking spot after 7 am, the only option is to drive to work, putting further strain on clogged roads in my electorate and beyond, not to mention the strain on family time.

        I would like to close by paying tribute to Mr Stan Knowles, the former state member for Ingleburn and for Macquarie Fields, who passed away on 30 December last year. Mr Knowles also served on the Liverpool council from 1976 to 1982, including a period as deputy mayor. Stan was a stalwart of the local
