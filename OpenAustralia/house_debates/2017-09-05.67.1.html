        My question is to the Minister for Human Services. Will the minister please update the House on the results of the independent evaluation of the cashless welfare card and the government's plans to expand the operation into new regions. How has the government's approach been received by local communities, including in my electorate of

         I thank the member for

         for his question. As members would be aware, we've been operating trials of a cashless welfare card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley for 18 months now. The aim is to reduce the very significant welfare fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug abuse that, unfortunately, operates in these communities. Indeed, as the initial conditions reports said, these communities were at crisis point and had faced a steady decline over the last five to 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday, we released the final evaluation of the trials. It showed that the card was making a considerable positive impact and turning these communities around. In relation to alcohol abuse, for example, 41 per cent of people were drinking less. There was a decrease in the alcohol related hospital presentations of 37 per cent in Ceduna. There was a 14 per cent reduction in apprehensions for public drunkenness and there were fewer referrals to the sobering up centres. There was evidence of a decrease in the number of women who were drinking while pregnant. Half of all people said they were gambling less. Half of all drug takers said they were taking fewer drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were also other broader benefits which were documented in the final evaluation. It included that people were reporting that they were better able to look after their children. Indeed, 45 per cent of people said they were better able to save money. There was also a decrease in requests for emergency relief. There were reports of more baby and children's products being bought at the stores. The local senior sergeant said of one prominent park: 'You can now see children playing and families sitting down, whereas previously we would be attending there virtually every afternoon for brawls.' These are incredible results. East Kimberley leader Ian Trust, who led the advocacy of the card, said that he hoped in 20 years time we would look back and say that this was the defining moment when things started to change for the better. Every indication is that he may be proved right.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, the Prime Minister and I announced the Western Australian Goldfields, in the member for O'Connor's electorate, as the next site for the card. The Goldfields, like other regions, has extensive problems with alcohol and drug abuse paid for by the welfare dollar. And I commend the member for O'Connor's advocacy of this card and for bringing together his community around it. It was welcomed very widely by community leaders. Perhaps the most powerful comment of support came from Betty Logan, an Indigenous woman and local councillor, and I'll finish with this point. She said: 'We know it will help make a difference to young kids' lives. Kids are neglected and parents are out of control because of excessive drinking. We can't stop that unless we have something like this.'
