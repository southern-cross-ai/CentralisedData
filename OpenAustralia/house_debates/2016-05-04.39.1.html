       <p>
        Canberrans feared the worst from the Abbott-Turnbull government's budget last night, because we know what Liberal government budgets mean for Canberra. We saw it under former Prime Minister Howard. We saw it under former Prime Minister Abbott. Last night, we saw it on show again with Prime Minister Turnbull: more Liberal cuts to Canberra; cuts to Canberra's economy; cuts to our community; cuts to Canberra's public service; and cuts to our national institutions. These are cuts we should not be asked to absorb.
       </p>
       <p>
        We found out last night that the Abbott-Turnbull government is cutting a further $1.9 billion from the Public Service. What do we get in return? Three hundred thousand dollars of investment in this city. It is absolutely outrageous. Those opposite say this budget is about jobs—which is true. It is about cutting thousands of jobs here in Canberra. That comes on top of thousands of public service jobs that have already been cut. It is about ripping thousands of pay packets out of the Canberra economy. It is about sacking the customers of Canberra's retailers and tradies. The

        <p>
         The 2016 budget is a real game changer for employment and the small businesses that drive our local economy in the Lyne electorate. A one per cent tax cut was announced, lowering the small business tax rate to 27½ per cent, and the accelerated depreciation threshold for small businesses has been increased to include those businesses with up to $10 million in turnover. This will improve their bottom line and drive growth in employment and the local economy. We also have an $840 million youth employment package. This will deliver a new youth jobs pathway involving internships in real jobs for 15 to 25 hours a week, jobs skills training and then $6,000 to $10,000 in employment subsidies to the boss if he takes you on at the end. That is real jobs for youth.

         Aged care has already received $15 million in the last 2½ years in the Lyne electorate, but there is another $249 million to support extra aged care in rural and remote Australia. Infrastructure spending continues. Accelerated delivery of the

         upgrade continues, as well as the Bridges Renewal, Roads to Recovery and the Black Spots programs. That is over another $500 million by 2019. This budget is really great news for jobs and growth in the economy.

          I can say one thing about the budget that was handed down last night, and that is that this government is delivering on the shocking cuts that were in the 2014 budget. Delivered last night were cuts of $240 million in emergency food relief for organisations that help our most vulnerable and $12 million for volunteer support programs. Another cut delivered last night was $45 million from the ABC. There were cuts to community legal aid centres and billions of dollars in cuts to health and education. This government is delivering on it cuts in the shocking 2014 budget. But that is okay. It comes back to priorities. What the government said last night is that they prioritise tax cuts for millionaires. Last night they delivered a tax cut for millionaires of $16,000. Meanwhile, those on the smallest incomes will get nothing. The member for Petrie said in the Federation Chamber today: 'That's is okay. We give it to the people on $80,000. For those on $50,000, $60,000 and $70,000—don't worry. When you earn $80,000 you'll get the tax cut.' How are they going to earn an extra $30,000 to get the tax cut? When is the bill coming forward to suggest that we will increase wages by an extra $30,000 for those on $50,000? We have negative wage growth in this country. Wages are not going up by $30,000, as some would like to suggest; they are going backwards. This government is delivering for one end of town and hurting the rest of us.

           <p>
            Unlike the member for Moore, I stand today to say what was not in yesterday's budget. Yesterday's budget was a very disappointing budget for the people of Lalor. It has been a week of contrasts. Last week in communities across Lalor we opened up the state budget to find that our communities were going to be supported, that roads were going to be delivered, that there was congestion-busting funding; but, in the federal budget, we find nothing. In fact, we have found less than nothing for the communities that I represent.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Treasurer came in last night full of bluster about his tax cuts; but, really, it was cheap-trick Tuesday, because a cheap trick was delivered in here last night. Families in my electorate will be worse off under this government. Four in five of the people working in Lalor—almost 80 per cent—will get no tax relief from this government because they earn under $80,000 a year. This is set against millionaires, who will get a $16,000-a-year tax cut. This is completely and utterly unfair. We did learn one other thing yesterday, and that is that

            is definitely a Prime Minister no different to the member for Warringah, who preceded him. One would have thought that he might have brought back the Office for Women, to have a look at this budget to see how it travels for women, but no.
