       <p>
        This morning, Ovarian Cancer Australia put on the Teal Ribbon Breakfast here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . It was very pleasing to see members from all parties attend that really important event where the Ovarian Cancer Australia friends talked about their national action plan for ovarian cancer research.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute in particular to someone who was a great friend of mine and to this side of the House—and, indeed, to the member for Reid—Bridget Whelan. She wrote the introduction to this policy document—an introduction that was read out to the group. I still remember when Bridget was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Today her message as a survivor of this dreadful disease was shared with the room. Bridget wrote: 'What women want is a cure. To us, it's that simple.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Improving awareness among policymakers and also among the general community is vital to achieving that goal. That is why the work of people like Bridget and other survivors, like Paula Benson, the chair of Ovarian Cancer Australia, and all her colleagues is so important and so meaningful. The same goes for all the medical researchers who are involved in this crucial field.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister was there and the Leader of the Opposition; the health minister and the shadow health minister; and a whole range of colleagues. We all spare a thought for the brave sufferers and survivors of ovarian cancer and their families, and for the families of the thousand women who die from this disease each year in Australia.
