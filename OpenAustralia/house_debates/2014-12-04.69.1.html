        I have a question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask the minister to advise the House on the steps that the government is taking to prevent extremists from leaving Australia to fight in Syria and in the Iraqi conflict and to keep Australians safe from the threat of terrorism.

        <p>
         I thank the member for Berowra for his very important question. The government places the highest priority on national security and that includes the threat posed by extremists who are supporting or joining terrorist organisations. Despite some recent gains against ISIL, or Daesh, in Syria and Iraq, the threat posed by foreign fighters remains. We estimate that about 15,000 foreign terrorist fighters from over 80 countries are fighting with terrorist groups in various conflicts in Syria and Iraq.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          The United Nations
         </a>
         estimates that about 200 foreign fighters are joining ISIL every monthâ€”so the threat is growing. Since January of this year, ISIL has focused on capturing and consolidating control over large areas of Iraq and Syria, with the Syrian province of Al-Raqqa serving as its de facto capital from where much of its operations are being directed. ISIL uses terrorist attacks extensively against civilians. This includes frequent mass casualty attacks and mass executions, including beheadings. ISIL boasts of these atrocities through social media and magazines that depict these violent acts. Five of these videos have featured American or British citizens and have included statements intended to threaten or intimidate western audiences. In recent months, ISIL atrocities in Al-Raqqa have included the beheading of 50 Syrian soldiers, with their heads being mounted on stakes, the kidnapping of thousands of women with them being sold as sex slaves and the routine raping by ISIL fighters in Syria of girls as young as nine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the provisions of our foreign fighters legislation I have today declared Al-Raqqa province an area where a listed terrorist organisation is engaging in hostile activity. This now makes it an offence under Australian law to enter or remain in the province of Al-Raqqa without a legitimate purpose. Anyone who enters or remains in Al-Raqqa faces a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment. This does not prevent people travelling to the area for legitimate purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It might be useful to the House if I table the maps depicting Al-Raqqa. I will pass one over to the Leader of the Opposition, as I briefed him earlier today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's listing will help law enforcement agencies bring to justice those who have committed serious offences, including associating with or fighting for terrorist organisations overseas. There is more to do. I have also cancelled around 75 passports and refused to issue around 10, to stop extremists leaving Australia to fight in conflicts. This government is committed to taking whatever steps are necessary at home and abroad to keep Australia safe from terrorism.

           <p>
            The opposition, like the government, has been extremely concerned about the reports of human rights violations in Al-Raqqa. There have been reports from the United Nations and from citizen journalists who have been active on the ground there to get information out about what ISILâ€”Daeshâ€”has been doing. We also know that this area is the capitalâ€”the headquarters, the centre of gravityâ€”for this organisation. It is from this area that attacks on Kobani and other parts of Syria and Iraq are being launched, driven and resourced.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also know, sadly, that there are Australians in senior positions in this organisation in this area. And there is no good reason for any Australian to be on this ground in this area, particularly not in the positions that we see in this organisation. So we are pleased to support, in a bipartisan way, what really is an extraordinary measureâ€”to declare a whole area a no-go zone, as we are doing today.
           </p>
           <p>
            We think it is very important that when this parliament has extraordinary new powers, that with those powers go transparency and accountability measures, and we will continue to engage in those. We are also very willing to assist the government. We are very concerned about the increasing numbers of Australians who are going to this region and the broader region to fight in what is a terrible conflict. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for that indulgence.
