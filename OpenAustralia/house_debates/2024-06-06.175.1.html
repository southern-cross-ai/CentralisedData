        On a cold, rainy night in April, I laced up my boots and trained with the De La Salle Football Club senior women's team, the Guns. As a rank novice, my intimidation melted away with the warmth and encouraging words from the girls. Students, nurses and engineers turn up after a long day at work to learn some skills, have a workout and have some fun. Despite a long day and the inclement weather, I ended up with more energy after training. The mood was buoyant because this team plays like a team and opens its heart to anyone willing to have a go. Under the watchful eye of coach Johnno, the girls hone their skills and tactics. This game is no spectator sport; it is demanding both mentally and physically.

        De La Salle Football Club is a community icon. It is 70 years old and led by the indefatigable Phil Proy and a team of legends, from coaches and physios to sponsors. Their partnership with

        creates an entry into this sport, ironing out the hesitancy girls experience, when boys look like they were born for it. I look forward to seeing these young women in action at a game, and I'll be cheering them on in colours and in life.

        For a shot of joy, you can't go past toy libraries. Perhaps that is the reason all three toy libraries I visited in Higgins were packed with parents and littlies. Carnegie, Malvern and

        in Ahsburton have a diverse array of toys and something for everyone, parents and kids alike. At a time when the cost of living is challenging and we are trying to live sustainably, borrowing developmentally appropriate toys makes great sense. These toy libraries have a focus on quality and repair, making them terrific examples of the circular economy. The toy libraries of Higgins operate through a low-cost model with low-cost membership fees, volunteer shifts and volunteer committees. They are also a place for connecting and for forging bonds. It's wonderful to see that Stonington has opened a branch in Prahran catering for families settling into the newly developed social and affordable housing. My sincere thanks to the people who make these toy libraries tick. You are what education sustainability and connection are all about.

        I had the opportunity to visit a Lighthouse home in my electorate and to hear about their Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program. This home came about thanks to the determination of Higgins parent Amy Eade and her colleagues at the Lighthouse Foundation. Amy partnered with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulfield_Grammar" rel="nofollow">
         Caulfield Grammar
        </a>
        , who, in an extraordinary act of generosity, donated a house to the Lighthouse Foundation. With a focus on youth homelessness and keeping young women out of harm's way, whether that be from family violence, human trafficking or forced marriage, the Lighthouse Foundation does vital work that resonates with community, especially young people. The Lighthouse Foundation, now 30 years old, is about creating the village when the familial one is either absent or has broken down. Trained youth workers are a constant presence, helping young people stabilise their lives and find a pathway. This is the difference between a life spiralling out of control and one that finds meaning. Homes are set up in strong communities like mine. It means that clients can access that critical infrastructure that makes a life sing. They also benefit from living in a stable, safe and productive community; in short, the environment itself has that therapeutic effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government's national plan released in October of 2022 sets out a vision to end gender based violence in one generation. This worthy ambition demands a whole-of-society effort, including place based interventions in partnership with strong organisations and communities. Government alone cannot do this. I commend Amy and the team at the Lighthouse Foundation, as well as lion-hearted schools like Caulfield Grammar, and I would encourage other organisations to pay it forward.
