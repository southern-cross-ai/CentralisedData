         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I made a public statement regarding these matters on 3 March 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government has undertaken a comprehensive compliance and fraud investigation through a forensic audit of the program. Those investigations resulted in the actions taken by my Department and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         ) on 2 March 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My Department has established a team to investigate these matters internally and they have received assistance from the AFP in pursuing those matters.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At this time it would be inappropriate to make any further comment on matters currently being investigated.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The information that I have previously announced will no doubt provide an assurance to the people of Australia that this Government is committed to pursuing those unscrupulous operators that chose to take advantage of the Home Insulation Program.
