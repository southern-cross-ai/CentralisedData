       <p>
        I thank the opposition for their cooperation in this matter. This will ensure, as a result of changes to the sitting timetable this morning between 10 o'clock and 12 noon, that the member for Melbourne is still able to move his private member's bill. I wanted to ensure also that the Leader of the Opposition was not disadvantaged by not being able to speak in this chamber as is appropriate for the Leader of the Opposition. He and the first speaker on behalf of the government for his private member's business relating to Fair Work Australia will be able to debate in this chamber. The rest of business that was set down for the main chamber and the Federation Chamber will be debated in the Federation Chamber tomorrow afternoon. I again thank the opposition for their cooperation in this matter.
