       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009 concerning a petition requesting the creation of a medal recognising the work of Australian Defence Force Cadets.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Please find below the submission that addresses specific components of the petitions terms of reference that relate to Defence’s position on this matter. A copy has also been submitted by e-mail to:

       Petitions Regal Ding The Creation Of Recognition Medal For ADF Cadets
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Government Submission
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Defence does not support the establishment of a new award to recognise the participation of young Australians in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Cadets. Consistent with the strong tradition and principles underpinning the Australian system of honours and awards, medals are issued to members of the ADF to recognise gallantry in operations, distinguished or long and effective service, and service in specific military operations.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The ADF Cadets is a community-based youth development organisation focused on Defence customs, traditions and values. The cadets are taught leadership, team building and survival skills. As stated in legislation, ADF Cadets are not members of the Australian Defence Force and are not part of any operational plan to provide for the defence of Australia. Specifically ADF Cadets do not undergo military training and are not ‘basically prepared for military service in the unfortunate circumstance that this becomes necessary’, as stated in the petition.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Also, the Committee may recall, that in 1993-94, the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA) took evidence from different groups that advocated the establishment of an award to recognise service by ADF Cadets. In its deliberations, the Committee was conscious of other worthy forms of youth leadership involving the commitment of long hours including service in the scouting and police citizens’ movements. In comparison, CIDA was not persuaded to recommend that ADF Cadets service required recognition through the award of a medal.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) has also advised that it would not support the creation of a civil medal to recognise service in youth development organisations, including ADF Cadets. Under the national honours system, awards to civilians are reserved for outstanding or exceptional achievements, or for service in hazardous or particularly merit-worthy occupations. The worthiness of the activities of the ADF Cadets is not readily differentiated from that of other youth development organisations, and recognition for achievement or service particular to those organisations is most appropriately provided by the organisations themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The ADF Cadets already have appropriate forms of recognition for its members. These include individual and group citations, parade acknowledgements, certificates, accredited proficiency awards, achievement of vocational certificates, and promotion. Additionally, various organisations make awards to cadet organisations, for example the NSW RSL Navy Cadet of the Year Award.
