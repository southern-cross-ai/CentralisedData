       <p>
        When a fisherman throws in a line and catches very few fish, they wonder: is it because there are hardly any fish or is it because they're fishing with the wrong tackle or the wrong line? The same applies when it comes to detecting, exposing and prosecuting corruption. Just because our institutions give the overall appearance that they are free from corruption, we need to ask: are they really? Or do we need better tools to expose it? This is why I called upon the government to establish a new comprehensive organisation to fight and prevent corruption at the federal level. Protecting and preserving the integrity of our institutions that are fundamental to our democracy must be our priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        The public needs confidence that public money is not being misused and that decisions being made across government are free from unlawful influence. The public also needs certainty that government services and programs are delivered efficiently and effectively, without compromise and free of corruption. To ensure we achieve this, I believe government needs to apply the right tools, provide the right resources and build the right organisational structure to create an independent institution that is capable of scrutinising our institutions to detect and expose corruption.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the moment there are over 11 fragmented agencies spread across government that are responsible for investigating allegations of corruption and misconduct by the Public Service, public officials, parliamentary and ministerial staff and political parties. I believe that we need a single, independent body, overseen by a bipartisan parliamentary committee, which has the power to investigate those suspected of acting corruptly.
       </p>

        As a former Queensland police officer, I've seen the environment created by the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Justice Commission
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Misconduct_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Crime and Misconduct Commission
        </a>
        and now the Crime and Corruption Commission. The Fitzgerald inquiry and the robust anticorruption legislation machinery and policies that were implemented in its wake have dramatically changed the culture, nature and landscape of public administration in Queensland for the better.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the government's commitment to develop legislation to establish a federal anticorruption body. It needs to be done thoroughly and without delay. If an appropriate bill is presented to the parliament, which will give the public full confidence that corruption will be exposed, I will vote for it. Unlike the states, as it stands today the bulk of our constituents have no idea who fights corruption at a federal level and whether they are doing an effective job. To restore confidence in our federal system, this must change.
