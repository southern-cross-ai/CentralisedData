        Lismore Speedway is renowned Australia wide as the track of champions, and this was highlighted again recently when local junior drivers Josh Boyd, Brock Youngberry and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Reeves" rel="nofollow">
         Connor Reeves
        </a>
        finished first, second and third respectively in the Australian Junior Sedan Championship. The trio travelled to Cullen Bullen speedway near Lithgow last week to secure their top three placings. These young men have had great success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to congratulate their families for supporting and encouraging their children's endeavours: Josh's parents, Trevor and Karen; Brock's parents, Paul and Janet; and Connor's mum, Tania, and grandfather Trevor. This outstanding result also moves the tally of Australian titleholders from the Lismore track of champions to 18 in its history. Congratulations to you all.

        Robbie Preston recently competed in the Australasian qualifier for the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation Academy World Cup, where he finished second. Placing second in his first qualifier event has allowed Robbie to qualify for the world cup being held in Egypt in just a few weeks. Robbie will be the only representative from Australia and indeed he is the first ever Australian to qualify for the world cup. Several years ago, at the age of 18, he suffered a serious case of glandular fever. Being unable to eat for three weeks, his body weight dropped to a low of just 45 kilograms. Soon after recovering he joined a gym and found calisthenics, and the journey began. I wish Robbie all the best.

        Candy Fitness from Alstonville's Candylane Fashion Boutique has for the past seven years organised an annual fundraiser—Tickled Pink High Tea—at the Alstonville Plateau Bowls and

        . It's to promote local awareness and raise money for local cancer charities. Some of the people helping this year included

        Sarah Moore, Deborah Marks from Deborah Marks Weddings and Occasions, and Felicity Jay from Black Tie Photobooths. For the past couple of years the money has gone to the local cancer charity Jody's Inspiration, with nearly $5,000 handed over to Jessie and Kym last Saturday. The event, with more than 150 tickets sold, was also attended by my wife, Karen, who always says how wonderful the afternoon is, with loads of fun and committed local women raising money for others. Many local businesses support this great cause by donating prizes for raffles and games, and I thank them. Congratulations to Candy and everyone involved for a great effort.
