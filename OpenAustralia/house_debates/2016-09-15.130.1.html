        Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, this is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate you on your election to your position, and I am sure it is one you will adorn with great grace—well done!

       <p>
        Mr Harness, who has just celebrated his 91st birthday, was 18 years of age when he was part of the first assault wave that landed on

        </a>
        on the morning of 6 June 1944. Standing on the bridge of his landing craft with his captain, he was subjected to direct fire while witnessing the carnage on the beach. He was lucky to survive the first wave of the assault and risked his life assisting in clearing the beaches for the second-wave assault. As a signalman, he communicated with incoming craft on where best to beach. His vehicle was severely disabled by a

        Mr Harness stayed in Normandy from D-day until his return to Portsmouth in October 1944. He later served in a

        His son Chris approached my office in late 2014 requesting I support his father's application for the Legion of Honour medal, and I was happy to oblige. As a British citizen, the necessary paperwork required much toing and froing between the British and French embassies in Australia and abroad. Finally, on Saturday 20 August, I had the great pleasure of attending the official presentation of France's highest military honour, the Legion of Honour medal, to Jim Harness—a decorated British serviceman and much-loved father, grandfather and great-grandfather—in front of his gathered family and friends at the National Anzac Centre in Albany.
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding the Legion of Honour, the French government acknowledges the sacrifices made by veterans like Jim who participated in the liberation of France. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Jim and his family for ensuring that his efforts for his country were justly recognised.
