        Last weekend, 25 March marked Greek Independence Day. Greek communities all over Australia celebrated with events, wreath laying ceremonies and church services in every major capital, including here in Canberra. The member for Bean and I attended a wreath laying ceremony, and I know that in Darwin the member for Solomon also attended events, because he kept on sending me selfies with different members of the Greek community for most of the day! In my own electorate in Adelaide, commemorative church services were held and then a wreath laying ceremony was held at the North Terrace
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         War Memorial
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, I was extremely honoured here in Canberra to be invited by the Greek community, together with the Member for bean,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to attend the Canberra events. These included a church service at the

        </a>
        at Kingston in the morning, followed by a wreath laying ceremony at the Greek war memorial near the War Memorial, and that was then followed by a lunch at the Hellenic Club. That was attended by a lot of people, including John Loukadellis, a tireless worker for the Greek community; Father Petros from St Nicholas Church; Bishop Bartholomew; Ambassador George Papacostas, the Ambassador of Greece; and the

        </a>
        for Cyprus.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a very special day for the Greek community not just in Australia but all around the world. All I can say is, 'Zito i Ellas!' That means, 'Long live Greece!'
