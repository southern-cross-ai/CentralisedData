       <p>
        It is my pleasure to rise today to speak of one of the most hardworking and community minded couples in my electorate of Macarthur, Ray—also known as Jesse—and Pauline James. Ray served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        for over 20 years from 1965 to 1985, including several tours in Vietnam during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . Then he spent 20 years working in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        . He has been a longstanding member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returned_and_Services_League" rel="nofollow">
         Returned and Services League
        </a>
        , and he is now president of the Ingleburn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . He is also president of the Macarthur branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association. Ray has just been elected vice-president of the New South Wales RSL and is part of the new broom changing the RSL for the better. Pauline has also just been elected as the president of the women's auxiliary of the New South Wales RSL.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Ray and Pauline have been tireless workers for my community's good for many years. As well as raising their two children in Macarthur, Ray and Pauline have been tireless advocates for Macarthur and longstanding supports for me. They have strongly supported our veterans community and have consistently looked for ways to address the issues affecting Vietnam veterans in particular. They are concerned about the high rates of mental illness, suicide and homelessness in veterans, particularly amongst our Vietnam veterans, and they have sought ways through state and federal parliament and local councils to help our Vietnam veterans and other veterans. They are passionate, compassionate people who lead by example and have done everything they can to support our community. They lead the dawn service on Anzac Day every year at Ingleburn RSL and have been very diligent in involving our local schools and our local young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know the future of the RSL is in good hands with the help of Ray and Pauline and their leadership. I am very grateful for everything they have done and I really look forward to helping them promote the needs of our veterans in the future. Last year on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        they also helped organise a celebration of the life of Kevin 'Dasher' Wheatley, Macarthur's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        winner from the Vietnam War, and I know this was very comforting for the family. Ray and Pauline had a longstanding friendship with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        , and some years ago they introduced me to him. Gough clearly respected them and respected the support they had given our community. Ray and Pauline are tireless workers for veterans and for the RSL. I see a very positive future for the RSL, and I look forward to helping them and the RSL with the great community work they do in the Macarthur area through the Camden, Campbelltown and Ingleburn RSL clubs.
