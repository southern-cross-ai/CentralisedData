       <p>
        Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bateau Bay
        </a>
        Neighbourhood Centre. This local community organisation is spearheaded by a dedicated and passionate team of staff and volunteers, who are truly making a difference to the lives of people in Dobell. In particular, the centre runs a popular Grandparents Raising Grandchildren group, who were kind enough to share with me their experiences and valuable feedback. The group was established to create a friendly, non-judgemental environment where grandparents who are responsible for raising their grandchildren can come along for a cuppa, support and a laugh.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group provides information on services available to help support those grandparents who take on the difficult role of physically, emotionally and financially supporting their grandchildren. The centre also provides a tool loan library, where home and garden maintenance tools are loaned out to community members who require tools to help maintain their homes. When you add in a kids' disco, a computer hub, a book library, a food store, an op shop, a homework group and a self-esteem team, this is a very busy centre that continually makes a positive difference to the people of the Bateau Bay community.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of this would be possible without Sheryl, the community development worker, and Ellen, Kelly, Peter, Danny, Wendy and the other volunteers, who dedicate their time to making a positive difference in the Bateau Bay community. This is a community that does it pretty tough and these kids go without a lot. So I congratulate this community group for all the great work that they do.
