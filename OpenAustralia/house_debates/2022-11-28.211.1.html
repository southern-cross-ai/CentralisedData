       <p>
        I count myself extremely lucky to have had many wonderful and generous mentors and friends that have helped me navigate and succeed as a representative of my community. Unfortunately, last week, our community lost one such passionate advocate.

         Alison Megarrity
        </a>
        was the member for Menai for 12 years, from 1999 to 2011. Before that, she served as a Liverpool councillor from 1994 to 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison was passionate about her family, her community and the Labor Party. Even after she left the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        parliament, she continued to help, support and campaign for our community and the Labor Party. She was instrumental in setting up Liverpool Labor. I don't think she ever stopped thinking about how to improve the lives of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison, unfortunately, has been unwell for some time, but that never stopped her emails to me of encouragement, advice and support. She was in Japan when the news of the Albanese government's May election victory reached her. I received an email at 1.38 am, congratulating us all on the election victory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Graham described Alison during the service as having a certain gentleness. She was generous with her time and support for anyone who graced her path. While it's hard for the rest of us, I acknowledge Alison's family, especially Robert, Liam and Glyn, and send them our love, thoughts and condolences.
