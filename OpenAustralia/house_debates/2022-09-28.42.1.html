       <p>
        There is widespread global condemnation regarding the killing in Iran of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini. We're all distraught over the deadly and disproportionate measures Iranian authorities have implemented to crack down on the ongoing protests. We're deeply alarmed by reports that dozens of people have been killed and many more injured, including children, due to the heavy handed measures Iranian authorities have implemented to crack down on protests against oppression and tyranny.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand with the courageous and patriotic Iranians who not only aspire to live in a country where everyone's rights are honoured fully and equally but also are keen to work through a peaceful process to get to that goal. We strongly support Iranian women and girls in their struggle for equality and empowerment, and we call on Iran to cease the oppression of women. Iran's people deserve a free and fair society, the freedom to practise their faith without hindrance and the opportunity to build their life on security offered by a functioning government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran, including the use of the death penalty, in particular for juvenile offenders; violations of political and media freedoms; and discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. We call on the Iranian authorities to exercise restraint in response to demonstrations and support a prompt, impartial investigation into Mahsa Amini's death by an independent body which ensures her family has access to truth and justice, with those responsible held to account. No Sheikh, no Shah.
