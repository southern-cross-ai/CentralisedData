        Recently I had my eyes opened, literally. I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Vision Australia
        </a>
        , which has its headquarters in the suburb of Kooyong in my electorate. The work they do is nothing short of life-changing. If you doubt for a minute how important Vision Australia is, I suggest you tie a tea towel around your head and try to walk around this chamber. Failing vision does not cause just blindness; there are many other flow-on effects, from falls to depression, loss of independence, medication mistakes, difficulty with personal care and social isolation, for both children and adults. Vision Australia provides practical and emotional support for all these problems and more.
       </p>

        During my visit I met Stella the working dog, who is really stellar. Vision Australia has its own in-house breeding program that ensures its puppies both are amenable to trading and work till the age of at least six or seven, and sometimes up to 11. I felt an alphabet book, where A is something with sharp spikes and even sharper teeth. Felix packs containing these tactile books are mailed out to children all over Australia and are put together by kind-hearted volunteers. I saw gadgets that actually make a difference—how about glasses that tell you where you are going or a headset that sends images to the part of your retina that has functioning receptors! I found out that the most requested aids for daily living are colour coded bump dots for appliances, bump dots for the power button on a remote control, a talking microwave that you can talk to to get it to defrost your food, a suction travel mug, magnifiers and a talking clock.

        Finally, I'd like to share Suzanne's story with you. Suzanne says: 'I have diabetic eye disease. I have lost all the peripheral vision in my eyes. I used to walk directly into walls and gates. I have broken my ribs and wrists from falls. My son said, "Enough. We've got to go and get you some help."' Through Vision Australia, Suzanne received her cane, which she loves to bits. It is such a simple thing, and so life-changing. Suzanne is now on the

        and is hoping to be able to use public transport for herself. She wants to start painting as a hobby and she's sure that Vision Australia will be able to help her. Her favourite game to play with her granddaughter is—wait for it!—peek-a-boo.
       </p>
       <p>
        'It's all about working with what you have.' That was a phrase said by one of the occupational therapists at Vision Australia. I believe that that's an admirable way to live as well.
