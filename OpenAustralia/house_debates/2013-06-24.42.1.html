        I rise today to acknowledge and pay tribute to the career of

         Ricky Ponting
        </a>
        , who announced his retirement from cricket last Thursday. From humble beginnings in Mowbray in my electorate, Ricky rose all the way to the top, becoming Australia's most prolific batsman of all time. He is also one of Australia's greatest captains. But his achievements are not confined to the cricket field. Ricky should also be commended for his charitable work, notably the establishment of the Ponting Foundation with his wife Rianna, which raises funds for young Australians with cancer and their families. He also helped out with the footy club where he played in his junior days

I know Ricky would not be happy with

        club is to move to Tasmania, I know he will be happy. He is now moving to Victoria, which is only 45 minutes from his beloved Tassie and so close to his North Melbourne. Just as you love cricket and North Melbourne, Ricky, you will always have a special place in the hearts of Tasmanians.
