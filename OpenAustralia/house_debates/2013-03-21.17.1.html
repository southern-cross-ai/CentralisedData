A comprehensive strategic planning study undertaken from the National Archives on the existing record storage capacity and capability against projected future requirements confirmed that repositories were operating at close to full capacity. Current estimation is that the National Archives will be full by 2015. A 2010 survey of Commonwealth agencies identified a backlog of 165 shelf kilometres of archives that will, in time, be transferred to the National Archives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Archives preservation facility was developed under the two-stage capital works budget approvals process. The new National Archives preservation facility at Mitchell, together with the proposed refurbishment of the existing Mitchell facility and an internally funded upgrade of the Archives' Sydney facility, will provide growth space until 2031.

        facility in the ACT will be relinquished. The new facility will enable the National Archives to partly address the 165-shelf-kilometre backlog, provide sufficient storage for growth until 2031, provide a greater capacity and capability for a digital repository and provide improved preservation and conservation work areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, a multistage procurement process will commence in 2013. The successful developer will commence work on construction of the new facility and the integrated fit-out in 2015, with occupancy planned for late 2016. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and commend the motion to the House.

        ) nuclear medicine project.

        The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, or ANSTO, proposes the construction of a new nuclear medicine facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Lucas Heights
        </a>
        , New South Wales. ANSTO is Australia's national nuclear research organisation and the centre of Australia's nuclear expertise. ANSTO operates the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPAL" rel="nofollow">
         OPAL
        </a>
        research reactor, used in medical isotope production and groundbreaking research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, each week, OPAL produces 10,000 doses of potentially lifesaving radiopharmaceuticals. In their lifetime, one in two Australians will require the nuclear medicines produced at ANSTO. These medicines are used in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous heart, liver, bone and kidney conditions as well as cancers. ANSTO's landmark infrastructure and nuclear expertise is also used to conduct research into areas of key national importance, such as climate change, water resource management and better ways to diagnose skin cancer. This new nuclear medicine facility has two components: a new nuclear medicine manufacturing facility and a co-located Synroc waste treatment plant. The export-scale nuclear medicine manufacturing facility will guarantee the future supply of molybdenum-99, or Mo-99, to Australians. Mo-99 is one of the world's most important nuclear medicines and allows the detection of life-threatening diseases and the opportunity to treat patients before a critical stage is reached. In Australia each year, 550,000 people receive a diagnosis using Mo-99. The new facility will also allow Australia to meet a significant proportion of the world's increasing demand for Mo-99, which currently totals around 45 million doses a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a facility that will produce medicines from low-enriched uranium. The project will position Australia at the forefront of a global movement to eradicate the use of highly enriched uranium and the military risks associated with it. The Synroc facility is based upon ANSTO's proprietary technology and is the world's first facility of its kind, able to treat a variety of wastes. It will provide a viable economic solution to consolidating waste that is a legacy of 50 years of Australian nuclear medicine production. The estimated out-turn costs of the proposed works is $168 million plus
