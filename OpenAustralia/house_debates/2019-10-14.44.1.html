        It's been another outstanding weekend in Darwin, so I just wanted to share with the chamber and the nation that we had the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Symphony_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
         Darwin Symphony Orchestra
        </a>
        playing heroic Beethoven, celebrating the human spirit. Some people don't think Darwin has culture, but there's an example right there, ladies and gentlemen. It was an uplifting performance. It was fantastic. I really want to congratulate everyone involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The symphony is not for everyone, so after that I journeyed down to the Darwin Surf Life Saving Club and to Pee Wee's by the beach, where Regurgitator was playing. Wasn't that a cracking concert! There were some colleagues about my age who perhaps hadn't been in a mosh pit for some time, and there were a couple of sore people the next day, I'm sure. But it just goes to show just a little bit of the complexity of the culture in the

        The following morning, it was great to join all the absolute intellectual powerhouses of solar energy from around the world who came to Darwin for the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge. They started on Sunday morning, and already they've gone over 600 kilometres south towards Adelaide. It's a great event. It's been going for 30 years. We've been supporting solar car challenges, and it just shows what's possible for the future.
