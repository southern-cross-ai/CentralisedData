        The Grand Gateway section of the Gateway WA project, Western Australia's largest ever road project, has been completed, four months ahead of schedule and reportedly under budget, under the Liberal state and federal governments. Many people deserve credit—the construction workers, the project managers and the state government, just to name a few—for bringing the spectacular set of new interchanges in under budget and ahead of time. But one person who does not deserve the credit he is claiming is the member for Grayndler, who almost sabotaged this whole project when he was minister for infrastructure by insisting it be linked to the funds raised by the mining tax. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the mining tax raised no money at all.

        So, when the coalition came to government in 2013, we had to work out how to fund this project and save it. Thanks to the current minister for infrastructure, we achieved this, and now the motorists, businesses and residents of Perth will benefit, along with our economy. The entire Gateway WA project has created 7,000 jobs. To date, Gateway WA has invested more than $500 million in third-party suppliers and subcontractors. The vast majority of this work has been delivered by more than 600

        I thank Prime Minister Abbott for opening the new stretch of road on Sunday. It was his sixth visit to Swan since being elected in 2013. Also attending the opening was the Premier,
