       <p>
        Thirty-six days, 520 kilometres and about 40 towns and villages, and hundreds of terrific yarns—the Kangaroo March re-enactment arrived in Campbelltown on 10 October, after more than a month tracking through the back roads and country lanes of my electorate. With my trusty stock steed Whiskey, I joined the marchers in Wallendbeen and Goulburn, having a great day riding. I also had the pleasure in attending the Breadalbane, Bundanoon and Thirlmere events—all with a great sense of pride. I know from speaking to many people who came to watch or take part in this event that this pride was shared right across the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is 100 years since the original Kangaroo March took place. The re-enactment was not about glorifying war; it was about remembering those sacrifices, to learn from them, to help new generations learn of their history and to help them to understand the issues that shaped us as the nation we are today. Importantly, residents along the route learned something more of their collective past.

        story is well known, of course. Less well known are the stories of the men who signed up after Gallipoli, who, as much as the ANZACs, helped forge the Australian spirit to be what it is today.

        On behalf of my electorate, thank you and congratulations to the committee:
