        This week is National Volunteer Week, when we acknowledge the important work of our volunteers and their organisations in building stronger communities. The spirit of volunteering is in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Australians and it is always supported by the Turnbull government. This, of course, includes our support for and protection of the 60,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

        volunteers, whose volunteer spirit was threatened by the Daniel Andrews Victorian Labor government, with threats to unionise them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers who continue to do wonderful work in Chisholm include all the mums, dads, grandparents and carers who volunteer to support the tradition of the great Australian pastime of weekend and after-school sport for our children. There is so much goodwill from and supportive activity done by volunteers in Chisholm, including by those in the

        and at Crossway LifeCare, who, as their company manager says, help those in tough places flourish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, as recently as last week I visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERA" rel="nofollow">
         MERA
        </a>
        group, the Melbourne Eastern Residents Association, which is a newly incorporated community group established by a few enthusiastic and passionate volunteers just in January this year but which has now had more than 540 families join who are predominantly of Chinese heritage and who live in the suburbs of Chisholm and surrounding areas. MERA aims to support and serve the eastern suburban neighbourhood, especially to assist migrants from different countries settle into Australia and the Australian way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers in Chisholm are among nearly 100,000 volunteers across Australia benefiting from $10 million in Turnbull government grants to support community organisations. Almost 2,700 community organisations will benefit from a grant to support the work of volunteers. I am so proud that the Turnbull government's investment in our communities is delivering vital support to small community organisations which would not be the same were it not for the people within them. Volunteer grants will assist a range of local groups, including the following, to name just a few: the Chinese Health Foundation of Australia; the Greek Seniors and Pensioners Association Clayton and District; the Victorian Vision Impaired Tenpin Bowling Association; the Burwood Neighbourhood House; and the Dixon House Neighbourhood Centre. The grants of between $1,000 and $5,000 enable all these organisations to better support their volunteers by purchasing much-needed equipment, training and transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        The energy, expertise and time our volunteers give to our communities support those most in need and represent what Australian communities are all aboutâ€”giving a helping hand. I am so proud to be part of a Turnbull government which is ensuring that our local volunteer organisations in Chisholm will have this support to continue their valuable work.
