        It was my great honour to recently attend the opening of Tamarama

        's new clubhouse. Since its inception in the 1900s, Tamarama has been a little club with a big heart which makes an even bigger contribution to our community. As well as running patrols, rescues and preventive action—incidentally, no life has been lost for over a hundred years—the club has a dedicated education team, competitions and programs, including first aid courses and the

        program. I'm also proud to say that the club has led the way on inclusivity. Its members are active participants in Lifesavers with Pride and the Rainbow Beaches program, and it has individual scholarships for members of the Aboriginal community and the migrant community. Truly this is a club where everyone belongs. Not only is their new clubhouse a stunning building with breathtaking views and even better facilities; it's also running on renewable energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank all of those who have helped make these renovations a possibility, including

You have all worked tirelessly to achieve this wonderful milestone. I know it has taken a lot of energy and patience, and I hope that you continue to enjoy your beautiful new home. Thank you for everything you do for our community.

        Over the last few weeks, it's also been my pleasure to see new life members of our surf lifesaving clubs across Wentworth being admitted. These people have made an enormous impact on our community, and it's due to their hard work and service that these clubs are the thriving community hubs they are today. I'd like to congratulate the following individuals for their years of service. From Bronte Surf Life Saving Club, there's Gaby Naher and Tony Coates. Gaby was inducted as their third female life member, and Tony has played a significant role in the club over many decades. From Bondi surf lifesaving club, there's Keiran Milne, who I saw inducted just the other weekend. Bondi has also announced a new scholarship for young members in memory of Louise Santos, an honorary life member who, sadly, passed away last year. North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club welcomed their current president, Steve 'Bluey' Larnach, as a life member, as well as two 70-year members, Max Sayer and Ken Hiscoe
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">

        . Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club welcomed Jan Featon as their first female life member. Jan was Clovelly's first female president, in the late 1990s, and she has been a huge influence on many women in the club today. From Tamarama Surf Life Saving club, there's Matteo Salval, the immediate past president; and Tom Bodger.
       </p>

        I'm so proud to represent these coastal communities and to work alongside our lifesaving clubs.
