        I am delighted that three organisations in my electorate of Solomon have been successful under the Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants program. The National Servicemen's Association of Australia in Darwin, 5th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment Association in Darwin and, of course, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKillop_Catholic_College" rel="nofollow">
         MacKillop Catholic College
        </a>
        in Palmerston all had projects funded under this commemorative grants program. Saluting Their Service is an Australian government initiative that aims to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian servicemen and women in the wars, conflicts, peace operations and also to promote appreciation and understanding of the role that those who served played in shaping our nation. This program is designed to preserve our wartime heritage and to involve people throughout the nation in a wide range of activities and projects. The National Servicemen's Association will receive $1,320 to install a National Servicemen's Association memorial plaque on the remembrance wall at the North Darwin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I had the pleasure of contacting the vice president of the association, Mr Ivan Walsh, who is a staunch supporter and advocate for our national servicemen, and he was as thrilled as I was that our servicemen will receive this great addition to help people remember those who have fought for and continue to fight for our nation. The North Darwin RSL are equally excited that this is happening.

        The 5th Battalion the Royal Australian Regiment Association will receive $4,000 to restore 5RAR commemorative plaques and a memorial wall at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Barracks
        </a>
        . The fantastic MacKillop Catholic College will receive $925 to install what is, in my opinion, one of the most important foundations at any school: a flagpole so that they can have the Australian flag. I will be visiting them very soon and will make sure that I present Lauretta Graham, who is the principal, with a flag. I hope that not too far into the future I will be standing with teachers and students and admiring our national flag in front of the school, which is named after its patron saint,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        All three projects will be of great benefit to the individual organisation, the students, the teachers, the veterans and members of the wider community. I look forward to these projects being completed. I would also like to put on the record my thanks to my good friend
