        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on recent actions of our border agencies that are helping to protect Australians?

         I thank the member for Hume for his question. Before I respond, I wish to note the announcement today of the appointment of my own department's secretary to be the secretary to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         . I am sure previous ministers for immigration would join with me in commending him on his service in that department. He is a fine public servant and an outstanding Australian. We wish him all the best.
        </p>

         This government is committed to border protection and to keeping Australians safe. That is why we have committed $49.6 million to establish counterterrorism units at airports around our country. This will ensure that there is increased
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
          CCTV
         </a>
         surveillance at those airports; increased resources for officers to engage in physical examination of baggage, personal effects and other items; and increased ability to collect intelligence and to be engaged in the processing of persons who may be suspected of being involved in things of a criminal natureâ€”as well as where they may be travelling or coming from.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, as part of that major package $100 million has been put into the works of enhanced departure screening and enhanced biometrics at our airports which will also further bolster the work that is being done at our airports to keep Australians safe and to pursue the very important measures we are putting in place as part of that broader counterterrorism initiative. That is being done here as well as overseas, where we are working closely with airlines and other partners.
        </p>
        <p>
         This will be supported by a package of legislation which will enforce, assist and enhance the value of these measures which are being put in place by the government. But these measures are not in isolation, because earlier this year the government put in place $88 million for increased screening of both air and sea cargo, and in 2013-14 alone saw, at least in air cargo, another 90,000 consignments screened as a result of that initiative. That comes on top of some $700 million and more which was put into the budget for the establishment of the Australian Border Force and the enhancement of the Customs and Border Protection Service's capacities in relation to all of their border protection operations.
        </p>
        <p>
         That goes across the full gamut, but I note in particular that it has resulted in a continuation of drug detections at our airports. Just last month, 440 kilograms of illicit drugs and precursors were detected at our airports. In one case in particular there was 150 litres of brown camphor oil containing safarole. That is a prohibited chemical in Australia, commonly used as a precursor in the manufacture of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDA" rel="nofollow">
          MDA
         </a>
         . That oil has the capacity to produce approximately one million ecstasy tablets. This is the strong and good work being done by our Customs and Border Protection Service, and our borders are strong as a result.
