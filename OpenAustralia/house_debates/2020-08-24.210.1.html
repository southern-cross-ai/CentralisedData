        Those who know me in this chamber know that I am passionate about supporting the families of in my electorate of Ryan. So it is with pleasure that today I stand to pay tribute to a local organisation, Baby

        . Baby Give Back is a completely judgement-free service, whose core mission is to ensure that every baby has a safe and equal start to life. Baby Give Back works alongside social service agencies, case workers and midwives throughout

The families they are helping with these second-hand baby goods are experiencing hardship for a multitude of reasons, whether it be escaping domestic violence, being refugees or job losses et cetera. Baby Give Back was started by Carly Lovell and Katie Stephen, who are both locals of Kenmore and the Ryan electorate. It is now in its third year of operation, and they have a very busy warehouse at

        thanks to all the donations that keep coming in. This year and last were a period of expansion for them as they went further into the Brisbane footprint. This is a testament to the work of Carly and Katie and also a testament to the wonderful generosity of those who are donating goods.

        I was very pleased to sponsor their Kenmore collection day, where there was a stream of donations being received. People were exceedingly generous, locals giving cots and baby carriers and clothing that they no longer required for their own family, which has gone to a family in need. Thank you to Carly and Katie, exceptional Ryan residents.
