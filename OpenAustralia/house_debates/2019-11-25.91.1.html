        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is taking strong and decisive action to combat violence against women and children?

         I thank my colleague the member for Robertson and commend her on her years of work in the field of women's leadership. Today, on the

          International Day
         </a>
         for the Elimination of Violence against Women, my colleagues in the other place the Minister for Women and the Minister for Families and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         have released a new implementation plan across all jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, to support delivery of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that all members of this place would claim to have a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women, but importantly we do have a bipartisan plan that invests in measurable outcomes that help women break the cycle of emotional abuse, physical abuse and, often, economic isolation. We're making the single largest Commonwealth investment in this important area, with $340 million to support this fourth action plan. It is a vision for an Australia free from all forms of violence and abuse against women and their children. It includes $82 million for better frontline services to keep women and children safe; $68 million for prevention strategies to help eradicate domestic and family violence in our homes, workplaces, communities and clubs; $35 million in support and prevention measures for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         communities; $78 million to provide safe places for people impacted by domestic and family violence; $64 million for 1800RESPECT, the national sexual assault, domestic and family violence counselling service; and $7.8 million for dedicated men's support workers in family advocacy and support services locations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course our aim is to prevent domestic violence, but when it occurs we know that victims need more than sympathy; they need practical help. They need a safe place to go, legal advice and help getting back to a normal life. Our budget includes other measures that will contribute to the improved safety of women and girls. The highlight is $1.2 billion over three years, from 2020-21, in Commonwealth funding for a variety of forms of legal assistance. The language of such plans is necessarily technical and can seem abstract, but I want to assure Australians that this plan is practical. It's hands-on, it's on-the-ground support and it's demonstrating the commitment that this government has. Of course, we know that more work needs to be done. Despite all the progress we've made, women are made victims of violence every day. But this fourth action plan, dedicated to countless women and children who are victims and survivors, with the strength of our will and our determination across this parliament, commits to leaving no-one behind.
