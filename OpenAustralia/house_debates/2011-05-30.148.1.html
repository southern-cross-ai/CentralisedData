       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes the devastating impact of tobacco products on the lives of Australians, with smoking causing numerous life-threatening diseases including cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, leukaemia and oral cancers, and that the majority of smokers regret the decision to ever start;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that there is significant evidence to suggest that creative design, branding and promotion of tobacco through its packaging:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) reduces the impact of graphic health warnings;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) increases the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products for adolescents; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) misleads consumers to believe that some tobacco products are less harmful than others;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that this Government is already implementing a suite of reforms aimed at reducing smoking and its harmful effects; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) supports the significant measures proposed by this Government including the measure to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products from 1 July 2012.

         (1) notes that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Australia had a record year in 2010 with 309 multiple organ donors;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) activity in 2011 shows that Australia is on track to steadily sustain this improvement with 112 donors already this year;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) following the injection of $151 million by the Government to establish a coordinated approach to organ donation, 242 staff have now been appointed in 77 hospitals and DonateLife agencies across Australia, thus enabling all jurisdictions to work cooperatively to support sustained improvements in organ donation;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) there were 931 transplants in 2010 and already there have been 327 transplants in 2011; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e)

          States and Territories
         </a>
         are committed to supporting this reform agenda; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) acknowledges:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the selfless act of all donor families who have supported new life for transplant recipients;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) the introduction of a national protocol for donation after cardiac death that will ensure Australia maximises the number of organ donors;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) that many hospitals that have not previously donated organs and tissue are now undertaking this important role as a result of the extra funding and staffing that are available;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) that the States and Territories reaffirmed their commitment to the reform agenda in February 2011, in particular the financing of increases in tissue typing, retrieval of organs and transplant surgery;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) the success of the two advertising campaigns launched in May 2010 and February 2011; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) the importance of continued input of community groups and non government organisations in raising awareness among the Australian community.
