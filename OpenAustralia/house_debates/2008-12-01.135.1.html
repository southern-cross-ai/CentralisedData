        Mr Speaker, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Papua
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        and Timor-Leste. The delegation I led visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        from 26 October to 5 November 2008. This parliamentary delegation to two of Australia’s closest neighbours was highly successful in further developing ties with the parliaments of each nation and better understanding their national contexts and the significant bilateral ties with Australia. Australia’s very close relationships with both Papua New Guinea and East Timor derive from geographic proximity, historical and economic ties, and strong people-to-people links. Australia is a key trade partner of both nations and provides extensive development assistance. The delegation was privileged to meet with the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea and both the President and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President" rel="nofollow">
         Vice President
        </a>
        of the East Timor parliament. During these meetings I was able to extend an invitation to both countries’ parliaments on behalf of the Australian parliament. These invitations were warmly received and we look forward to those reciprocal visits.
       </p>
       <p>
        The close government-to-government ties maintained between Australia and both countries have been emphasised in recent times by a number of high-level visits between Australia and each nation. However, the development of these democracies and their legislatures means that parliament-to-parliament ties are also critical. This timely parliamentary delegation enhanced parliamentary relations. Our meeting with the Australia-Timor-Leste parliamentary friendship group was one of the many valuable opportunities to exchange professional anecdotes and share experiences critical for the continued growth of effective democracy in all nations. Throughout our visit the delegation received consistent appreciation for Australia’s ongoing assistance in the development of governance structures and procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the delegation’s meetings we not only gained national insights but were also given the opportunity to outline Australia’s position in a number of policy areas. The significance of universal, accessible, compulsory national education as a framework basis for wider development was a critical point of interest for me. In addition, the importance of a transparent and independent public sector was discussed, as was Australia’s strong interest in sustainable development. Discussions with key government, business and non-government representatives pinpointed important areas in the protection of the environment, resources and the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Papua New Guinea is home to some of the world’s first climate refugees—the Carteret Islanders, who have been relocated to Bougainville as their islands have been rendered uninhabitable by global warming. Our work in Papua New Guinea and East Timor included visits to numerous AusAID projects in the law enforcement, education, health and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        -
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        sectors. The unique operating environment informed us of some of the challenges faced by AusAID and other agencies. It is clear that AusAID’s development work in countless areas is warmly received and is in the interests of both Australia and the region more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another critical element of success that I noticed, particularly whilst visiting east Timor, was a high level of optimism. This is a testament to the commitment of the nation’s people and to leadership—and we were able to meet with East Timor’s leaders—and is a clear indicator that effective development outcomes are bolstering future advancements. I particularly enjoyed our visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileu_District" rel="nofollow">
         Aileu District
        </a>
        , with which my local council, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Moreland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the neighbouring

         City of Hume
        </a>
        , have strong ties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Visits to Australian war history sites in both countries and current Australian Defence and police contingents in East Timor reminded us of Australia’s significant shared military history with close and allied neighbours. Meeting with officers and troops posted to each nation gave us insights into the difficult conditions under which Australian contingents operate. Their success is a testament to the dedication and training of the men and women of the Australian defence forces and the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the officers in the respective country missions of Papua New Guinea and East Timor. Their effort and cooperation ensured that this was a productive and beneficial delegation. Particular thanks go to Mr Chris Moraitis, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, and Mr Peter Heyward, Australian Ambassador for Timor-Leste. These officers and their colleagues provided extensive support to the delegation. I also extend my thanks to the other members of the delegation—the deputy leader, Mrs Louise Markus MP, Senator Michaelia Cash and Mr Brett Raguse MP—for their hard work and cooperation in ensuring the success of the visit. I thank Ms Fiona Way in the Parliamentary Relations Office for her efforts leading up to the visit, and the delegation secretary, Ms Roberta Molson, for her first-class assistance throughout the delegation.

        <p>
         It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Papua
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          New Guinea
         </a>
         and Timor-Leste and to concur with my colleague the member for Wills. We indeed have a close relationship and close ties with both
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         and Timor-Leste. It is important, particularly in view of Timor-Leste’s recent independence, that we continue to strengthen those tries and support that strengthening democracy. It is also important that we continue to contribute towards not just the development of Timor-Leste but also the provision of security assistance. Both democracies, while different and unique for various reasons, are developing, and it is important that the parliamentary ties between their parliaments and ours continue to be built.
        </p>
        <p>
         The aims of the delegation, I would like to say, were reached. We aimed to strengthen those parliamentary ties. Meetings not just with parliament but also with government departments, with many businesses and with non-government sectors gave both
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         and Timor-Leste—and also the Australian delegation—an opportunity to understand the context in which we work. It enhanced our understanding of the several cultures. Papua New Guinea, for example, has 854 different languages and as many different cultural groups. Timor-Leste, while more homogeneous, certainly has a sense of unity and is very positive, as the member for Wills has noted, and optimistic about their future.
        </p>
        <p>
         I turn to other aspects of the delegation’s work. For example, in Papua New Guinea, there were visits to several AusAID funded programs. We also visited organisations, departments and non-government sectors that were dealing with law enforcement, education, health,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
          HIV
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
          AIDS
         </a>
         issues. Some of those organisations included the Alotau Police Station, the Hohola Youth Development Centre, Hagita Secondary School, Alotau Hospital and the PNG StopAIDS program. Each represented very well the impact of AusAID. Alotau Hospital, for example, was very impressive. AusAID funds have been able to provide a well-fitted-out maternity ward, and this saves not just women’s lives but also children’s. Mortality is quite high in PNG, particularly for mothers who are giving birth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delegation also noted the advancement made by Timor-Leste since independence and, as noted earlier, its optimism. AusAID has been involved in improving several things in Timor-Leste, including education, employment, health, food security, infrastructure and agriculture. It was noted by anybody we met that our assistance was most welcome. Both these nations are important not just to Australia but also to our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another important focus of our visit was on Australia’s war history, and I would particularly like to thank the officers of the missions in both PNG and Timor-Leste for their assistance. I will just focus momentarily on the war history of both nations. Australia has been heavily involved in both nations with regard to this. For example, Australia’s military history with PNG is extensive. Nearly 6,000 Australians were expected to visit not only the historic
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
          Kokoda Track
         </a>
         in 2008 but also many other places throughout Papua New Guinea. The same applies to Timor-Leste, with Australian involvement both during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         and more recently, and there are a number of memorials which we were able to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to thank the delegation leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Thomson" rel="nofollow">
          Kelvin Thomson
         </a>
         , and Senator Michaelia Cash and Mr Brett Raguse. We worked very much as a team, and it was very informative. We have invited delegations from both countries to come to Australia, and we are looking forward to that.
