        There is an amazing organisation in my community which literally saves lives. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hughes" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Foundation turn bystanders into first responders in cases of sudden cardiac arrest. Their mission is to increase the number of defibrillators in our community and to train people to use them effectively. There are around 30,000 incidents of cardiac arrest each year in Australia, and the out-of-hospital survival rate is less than nine per cent. On average, New South Wales Ambulance responds in between eight and 11 minutes, but it only takes four minutes for brain damage to occur and, after eight minutes, there is very little chance of survival.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation aim to install more than 100 defibrillators and train over 500 people. They came to my attention when they applied for and were granted $20,000 through the Stronger Communities Program last year. The Michael Hughes Foundation are currently looking for expressions of interest from local community groups who want to become heart safe. They have secured funding for 43 defibrillators across Parramatta, and there are still 15 to be allocated. It is a great opportunity for community organisations not only to have a defibrillator installed but also to be provided with the necessary training.
       </p>
       <p>
        The organisation's executive director, Julie Hughes, was not always an activist. Four years ago, her husband, Michael Hughes, died of cardiac arrest soon after the birth of their daughter. He was 38 years old. In the midst of such loss, Julie has worked to do something positive for our community so that others might not have to endure the preventable loss of a loved one. Thank you to the Michael Hughes Foundation for your great work.
