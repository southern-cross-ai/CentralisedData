       <p>
        Today I want to outline a three-point package for the towns of Rosebud, Rye and Dromana on the southern peninsula within my electorate of Flinders. What characterises these towns is that as well as having a spread of people—whether they be families, younger singles, older retirees or business people—they also have a very high concentration, arguably the highest concentration in Victoria, of over 60s. When you look at any major demographic area you find that this area has the highest concentration of over 60s. So the care and assistance that needs to be provided is of a special nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that basis I am delighted to announce three things. The first is that the Australian government will be providing respite funding of $38,400 for carers of the Southern Peninsula Community Care. What this means in practice is that three new carers per week will be provided for centre based respite for up to 24 hours per week. That is a tremendous initiative for local carers. This service is not just confined to the elderly; it could be for the family of someone with a disability, whether that be a child or an adult. I recognise that this need for care extends further and that is why I am absolutely delighted—and I will categorically defend it—at the inclusion of a carer’s component for respite as part of the final solution being prepared at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The second announcement which I wish to present to the House today is a grant of $21,00 under the Australian government’s recreational fishing community grants program to help the Rosebud Motor Boat Squadron build a jetty to assist people with a disability. This jetty, to be built by the Rosebud Motor Boat Squadron in conjunction with Wongabeena Association or, as it is now known, Disability Opportunities Victoria, is a great step forward for both the elderly and those with disabilities in the electorate of Flinders, particularly in that stretch from Dromana to Rosebud to Rye, who often have difficulty accessing pleasure water craft. Access to these boats is a wonderful way of giving them therapy as well as personal joy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third announcement I want to discuss very briefly is to reaffirm my absolute commitment to work with the council, the community and the state in finding every possible source of funding for a Rosebud aquatic centre—a great initiative. It will help families, young people and the elderly within our community.
