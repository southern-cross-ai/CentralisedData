       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's burgeoning commodity trade provides us with a once in a generation opportunity to become part of the international shipping trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill, the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, will provide the vehicle to achieve this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, we have only four Australian flagged vessels participating solely in the international trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to move up the value chain—not only do we want to mine the iron ore for the world; we should be transporting it to the world as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last 20 years, international registers have been embraced by many advanced countries, which, like Australia, have seen a large portion of their fleet register offshore.
       </p>
       <p>
        International registers offer some of the benefits of open registers, such as the ability to use crew of different nationalities, while ensuring that the ship owner maintains a strong link to the country of registration.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are not flags of convenience.
       </p>
       <p>
        All companies with vessels on the international register will need to demonstrate strong links to Australia, ensuring that our maritime safety regulator, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Maritime Safety Authority
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
         AMSA
        </a>
        ) has the regulatory reach to ensure compliance with our high safety, environmental and occupational health and safety standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with this, the primary objectives of this reform are to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The bill establishes two shipping registers—the general and the international registers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the general register, AMSA will have the discretion to register a vessel on the international register and will have the power to cancel registration.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill sets out a range of matters that the registrar may have regard to when making a decision to register a vessel.
       </p>
       <p>
        This decision is reviewable.
       </p>
       <p>
        This discretion is important to ensure that we maintain a quality flag.
       </p>
       <p>
        The crewing and labour provisions are a key element of this bill and go to the core of its competitiveness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I outline these provisions, I would like to thank those in the labour movement who have worked with us on these provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This reform package is not pro-union, it is not pro-business; it is pro-Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both employers and unions alike have worked constructively with the government to ensure that these reforms are world's best practice and offer the industry the best chance to compete on a level playing field with international shipping.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides for mixed crews on the Australian international register vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, international vessels will be required to employ a minimum of two Australian crew members; preferably the master and the chief engineer.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the benefits of mixed crewing will be the employment opportunities for seafarers in the Pacific region and I know that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Maritime Union
        </a>
        of Australia is working hard on these regional partnerships.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that the international register is competitive, crews will be employed on international terms and conditions while engaged in international trading.
       </p>
       <p>
        These employment conditions are in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">
         MLC
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Minimum wages and a number of conditions are set out in the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless specifically amended in this bill, the provisions of Chapter 2 in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Navigation Act
        </a>
        1912 will also apply to these seafarers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This creates a safety net.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides for collective agreements to be negotiated through a seafarers' bargaining unit (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBU" rel="nofollow">
         SBU
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        A collective agreement agreed with the SBU will be required for registration in the international register.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also ensures that seafarers who suffer long term injury or death are adequately compensated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill requires that ship owners hold insurance cover that provides for the level of compensation set out in the International Transport Workers' Federation Uniform Total Crew Cost Collective Agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        AMSA will have additional powers to ensure vessels comply with the working, living and crewing condition provisions contained in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        A civil penalty and infringement notice regime is also established under the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures are important to show there is no derogation of standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greater involvement by Australian companies in international trade will provide the catalyst to reinvigorate our domestic trades.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with this, vessels registered in the international register will have limited access to the coastal trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operating under temporary licences, these vessels can compete with foreign flagged vessels in the coastal trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have already made clear, the Fair Work Act 2009 will apply to vessels operating under temporary licences.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure our ships are on a level playing field with foreign flagged vessels, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992will not apply to international register vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know there is some concern that some coastal trading vessels may seek to avoid their legal responsibilities by joining the international register.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will not happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill includes a requirement that vessels must be predominantly engaged in international trading.
       </p>
       <p>
        Registration can be cancelled if this requirement ceases to be met.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
