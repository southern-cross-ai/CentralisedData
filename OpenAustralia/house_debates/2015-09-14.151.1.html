       <p>
        Recently, I presented a number of schools in my electorate of Tangney with an Australian government Anzac Day Schools' Awards. The schools I attended ceremonies at were
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossmoyne_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Rossmoyne Senior High School
        </a>
        and Riverton Primary. I also presented an award to Leeming Education Support Centre, though I did not attend the ceremony in person. It was a privilege to participate in these award ceremonies. I doubt I am alone in this place in saying that it is very often the highlight of the week. These awards channel all that is best in us. I commend the students of Rossmoyne Senior High School, Riverton Primary Campus and Leeming Education Support Centre for their excellent effort to pay tribute to the Anzac soldiers and the teachers for their commitment to teaching students about Australia's wartime history.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Centenary of Anzac is our nation's most important period of commemoration and educating our next generation about the service and sacrifice of all of our servicemen and servicewomen is crucial. It is a critical component of carrying the Anzac legacy into our future. I congratulate the schools, teachers and students on ensuring that the contribution of all those who have served our nation will never be forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is through education that the Anzac story is understood. The awards I presented were: Rossmoyne Senior High School, WA Winner, Secondary, which received a $2,000 cheque, a plaque and a winning certificate; Riverton Primary Campus, Best Anzac Centenary Learning, which received a $1,000 cheque, a plaque and a certificate; and Leeming Education Support Centre, Highly Commended School, which received a highly commended certificate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Anzac Day Schools' Awards encourage the study of Australia's wartime history in schools through learning activities and the commemoration of Australian service men and women on Anzac Day. Thirty-eight schools nationwide shared in a total of around $48,000 in prize money, which is funded by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        through its Commemorations Program. For more information on the Anzac Day Schools' Awards visit www.anzacportal.dva.gov.au or my website dennisjensen.com.au.
