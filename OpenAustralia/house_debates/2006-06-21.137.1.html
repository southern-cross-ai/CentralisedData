        In 1996, just after I was first elected to parliament, I established the Forde community contribution awards as a way of saying thank you to those special people who dedicate so much of their time to helping others. Honourable members will all know the type of people that I am speaking about: those who have done a regular shift at the Meals on Wheels for the past 10 years, those who run the local sporting clubs and coach the local teams, those who always put up their hand when it is time for the Red Shield Appeal or if there is a working bee at the local community centre and those special people who take on the job of chairman, secretary or treasurer at the local

        or sporting associations.

       <p>
        These people are the backbone of our communities, especially our rural and regional towns. They symbolise the Aussie tradition of helping out a mate. They give our towns their heart and their soul and they touch the lives of others in a very positive way. Their work helps build stronger local communities where businesses, government, community organisations and individuals can work together to help others tackle some very special issues in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been proud to recognise many exceptional local volunteer workers over the past 10 years, and this year there were 15 remarkable recipients of the 2006 Forde community contribution awards. I want to make special mention of and pay tribute to them here in the national parliament. I know that each of these people have given so much of their time and have made real differences to our community in a variety of ways. They never seek recognition, but were nominated by grateful local residents, who value their hard work. They have worked across a range of community organisations including RSLs, schools, community centres,

        It is with great pride that I inform the House that the worthy recipients of the 2006 Forde community contribution awards were: Lynn Bartimore from

        I feel very honoured to be able to recognise the ongoing work of these local volunteers through the awards. I hope the example of our award recipients will inspire even more local residents to take up more voluntary work.
