       <p>
        I recently had the privilege of officiating at the grand opening of the new four-wheel drive light commercial vehicle and used vehicle facility at Robina Holden. This was a great occasion and a wonderful celebration of what Paul and Kathy van Riet have achieved since opening the Robina Holden facility in 1997. Paul’s and Kathy’s dream and vision was to develop a dealership that would be 21st century in its design as well as cutting edge in its customer facilities. Every stage of the facility was carefully considered and planned to develop and produce a state-of-the-art centre, and that vision has certainly been achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dealership first commenced in 1997 with 26 staff members. Eight years on there are more than 100 staff and the company is still growing. It is now the No. 1 dealership in Queensland and No. 7 in Australia in the sale of Holden’s four-cylinder vehicles—not a bad record in a very short period of time. Even more impressive—and, to Kathy and Paul and the team, more important—is the valuable role Robina Holden plays within our local community. Right from the beginning, Paul and Kathy wanted their business to bless the people of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . Over the past eight years the company, with support from the staff, has donated over $1 million in sponsorships and gifts to charity. That is an extraordinary commitment to our local community. I would like to wish Paul and Kathy and all the team at Robina Holden my very best wishes for the future. There is no doubt the business will continue to grow in the future and the Gold Coast community will be forever grateful for the commitment this family makes to us all.
