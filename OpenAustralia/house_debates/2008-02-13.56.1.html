        My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Is the minister aware of the view of the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

        National President Warren Mundine that the permit system for remote

         Northern Territory

        townships should be scrapped? I ask further: why is the government at odds with the most senior Aboriginal in the Labor Party on this very important issue, which is at the heart of the intervention that the government claims to support?

         I thank the honourable member for his question on a very, very important subject, particularly as it has to do with economic development and the participation of

          <p>
           This is an important issueâ€”and I will come to the permits issue, which is a critical matter that the government has a commitment to. I might just remind the honourable member that at the time of the election on 24 November the permit system was still in place. The permit system has remained in place for the last 11 years. I think that fact needs to be remembered before we go any further.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the issue of economic development, as I said, this government is strongly committed to making sure that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           are able to participate as much as possible in the economic boom that is taking place. The Minister for Resources and Energy and I just recently went to the Pilbara to make sure that we were able to understand, as quickly as possible in our new portfolios, how we could assist the mining industry to deliver on the commitments that they have to Indigenous Australians to make sure that Indigenous Australians can get the jobs that are available in many of these mining communities. We are determined to work with the mining industry, the forestry industry, the tourism industry and all of the industries that are now recognising that many Indigenous people want to be part of this economic boom. We will certainly do everything we can to make those opportunities come alive.
