       <p>
        This presentation includes several large petitions that draw attention to recent events in Iran and request the Australian government to take action in response.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly this issue has been a matter of concern within Australia and around the world. For the petitioning process, petitions that attract interest from overseas can pose a challenge. The standing orders require that all signatories to petitions are either citizens or residents of Australia. To sign a petition—either in paper or via our website—a signatory has to declare that they are a citizen or resident of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its inquiry in the last parliament into petitioning security and accessibility, the previous committee considered how best to enforce this requirement. The inquiry looked at whether more active identity-verification methods should be introduced, such as crosschecking with official records like the electorate roll.
       </p>
       <p>
        After consideration, the committee decided that using additional verification would unreasonably limit accessibility. The committee's view was that self-declaration was the right balance between compliance and allowing anyone who wishes to petition the parliament to easily do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        On occasion, the committee will report to the House on petitions that may have some invalid signatures. One way of testing this is by reviewing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP" rel="nofollow">
         IP
        </a>
        addresses of signatories. This is not a fail-safe method, as you can be a citizen or resident of Australia and be overseas, or in Australia and using a private network.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of the petitions presented today, there are an unusually high number of non-Australian IP addresses. Despite this, after consideration the committee is satisfied that there is a genuine intention to petition, that most of the signatures are compliant and that the matters raised in the petitions warrant a ministerial response. However, the committee would like to draw the attention of the House to the possibility of noncompliant signatures and will continue to monitor this issue in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to note that present in the chamber are the members for Bennelong, Kooyong and Menzies, who all have a deep interest in the petition on the events in Iran that I'm tabling today.
