        Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as you would know, one of the joys of this job is the people you meet and the organisations you come across. Today I would like to acknowledge one of these organisations in my electorate of Indiâ€”DAIS, the Disability Advocacy and Information Service. They support and provide advocacy and information for people with disabilities and their families and carers. It is an amazing not-for-profit service that looks after all of north-eastern Victoria and southern

        . They have three main services: they provide advocacy for people with disability; they provide justice support; and they also provide home and community care, or

        , access and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the pleasure recently of opening the new offices for DAIS in Wodonga, and what is really fantastic about the new office is that it is owned by DAIS, and it is creating a social enterprise without losing focus on its core business, which is providing access. So, to all the team, can I say thank you, and how proud I am of you and to be your representative here in parliament. To Dianne King, Chairperson of the DAIS board; to Ruth Harris, Vice Chair; to Brian Fealy, Treasurer; to Jen Tait, Secretary; and, Martin Butcher, to you as the

        : congratulations on what you do. And I know it would not be possible without all the people you work with and all the volunteers that you engage. So warm congratulations, and I wish you a fantastic future in your new buildings.
