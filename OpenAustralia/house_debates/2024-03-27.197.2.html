        Not far from here, just down the walkway, just down the line, is the

         Australian War Memorial

        , a place where those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their nation are remembered. There is a special place in that very special place with a plaque that reads: 'In memory of those Australians killed in military training. Forever remembered, having made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.' Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon will soon be remembered alongside those others who lost their lives in military training.

        I was pleased that the shadow defence minister, the member for Canning, talked about the importance of parachute training and how it fits in with what our soldiers and, indeed, what those serving in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

        and Navy do in this regard to ensure that they are best of the best. As a member of the 2nd

        </a>
        , Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbons was one of the very best.
       </p>
       <p>
        You only need to see his face on the leaflet for the mass to know that he was a man of character. He was so fresh faced, very bright eyed, very full of life, full of vitality, full of more to give, and he's been taken way too soon. He died after sustaining dreadful injuries during that parachuting incident on 6 March at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Richmond" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . At 33 years young, he had, as I say, so much more to give to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , to his regiment, to his family, to his community and to his nation, a nation he loved so much.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was and as has been described as a dedicated, highly skilled and courageous soldier. Jumping out of aeroplanes is dangerous; it is. But you have to do it because you have to train in all sorts of weather, day and night, and he had done more than a hundred jumps. He knew what he was doing. It's just so tragic that he has been taken so young.
       </p>
       <p>
        He graduated from Kapooka,

        —home of the soldier—in April 2014. His dad was there, Joel—of course, the former member for Hunter and a former defence minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joel knew the dangers of soldiering and so did Jack's beloved partner, Kass. The story was told at Jack's farewell that they were planning to get engaged and planning to have a family. That has all been taken away. As I mentioned in my contribution last night, when I began this condolence motion, I know that his sister Grace, now a Channel 7 reporter, worked at Wagga Wagga for some time—a very, very good reporter. She took to Instagram to pay tribute to her brother. She shared photos from their childhood and adulthood, as well as a screenshot of the last message he sent her. She wrote, 'I love you, my darling big brother, I am so proud of you.' She said that Jack always had her back and then accompanied it with a photo of the pair as children, writing, 'From day one'. I know Gracie well; she's a beautiful, beautiful person and she was just heartbroken. I just can't even start to imagine the pain the whole family is going through.
       </p>
       <p>
        In one sense it's just so unjust, but Jack died doing what he loved doing: serving his country, wearing the uniform and doing something that's hard. It's easy to do things that are easy, but that's not the Fitzgibbon way. When he graduated from Kapooka, he won an award for excellence in physical training. He probably would have won the best soldier of the platoon but for what, as I understand it, was a spider bite. He spent a night where he was unable to be with his mates and doing what they were doing on that particular evening. But he excelled, and the people of Kapooka remember—they remember the good ones, and they honour them. He will always be remembered.

        I just want to read this poem. It's by an American, somebody who was a veteran—Charles M Province. It really goes to the nub and the heart of what soldiering is all about, and what we have lost with the death of Lance Corporal Fitzgibbon. Charles Province wrote:

        It is the Soldier, not the minister, who has given us freedom of religion.

        It is the Soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press.

        It is the Soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of speech.

        It is the Soldier, not the campus organizer, who has given us freedom to protest.

        It is the Soldier, not the lawyer, who has given us the right to a fair trial.

       <p>
        Who serves beneath the flag,
       </p>
       <p>
        And whose coffin is draped by the flag,
       </p>
       <p>
        Who allows the protester to burn the flag.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jack Fitzgibbons' casket was adorned, was draped, with an Australian flag.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our nation is much the poorer for his passing. His duty is done, his time has come and it is just so, so sad. Lest we forget.

         I thank and acknowledge all of those who have spoken on this motion before me, and those who will come after. It's always a difficult job to rise on the floor of parliament and to speak on a condolence motion, but I rise to add my name to the many condolences that have been expressed, not just in this House but in my community and, indeed, across the nation for the tragic and untimely death of Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was, as we've heard, a very proud member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , and loved serving his country. Jack served with the 2nd
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Commando Regiment
         </a>
         in his dream job as a signaller in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces" rel="nofollow">
          Special Forces
         </a>
         . Throughout his career, Jack was awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Medal
         </a>
         and the operational service medal for counterterrorism, a testament to his dedication to serving his country. His courage, distinction and leadership skills saw him rise fairly rapidly, really, through the ranks as a respected colleague and someone who could be counted on.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the funeral in his home town at an absolutely packed church, plus all of the people in the street outside the church, really was a testament to the love for not just Jack but his entire family, because, of course, those that are left behind bear the burden of grief. Jack was the clearly much-adored son of both Joel and Dianne. Joel is known to many people in this House because of his service and, indeed, his father's service in the Australian parliament. So they have given many, many decades of service to their respective communities.
