        On 14 November I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural Bedfordale Connect Bush Markets at the Bedfordale Hall. I was very pleased to see the local community out in force on a Saturday morning to support the stallholders and the Bedfordale Connect Bush Markets Committee, who worked so hard to get this event up and running. I would also like to acknowledge the

         City of Armadale
        </a>
        , which I know was fully supportive of the project from inception to realisation. It was great to see their mayor, Henry Zelones, and Councillor Guenter Best, who also were in attendance. My state colleague, the Hon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Simpson" rel="nofollow">

        , had even baked a festive twist for the lucky winner of the raffle.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a fantastic variety of goods on offer, including arts and crafts, farm fresh produce, children's entertainment and plenty of food and drink. A special mention goes out Bedfordale locals Linton and Kerry Batt of The Butchers Block, a farm-to-plate producer. They cooked me one of the best bacon breakfasts I have ever had. Their son, Geordy, was equally impressive on the didgeridoo.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we well know, small businesses are the backbone of a strong economy, and I am pleased to report that business in Bedfordale is thriving. By bringing the goods to the consumer, the Bedfordale Bush Connect Markets forge important and lasting connections between local producers and small businesses and the wider community. I would like to thank Kerry Batt, the Bedfordale Connect Bush Markets Committee, the stallholders and the City of Armadale for putting on a great event. I look forward to visiting again in the future.
