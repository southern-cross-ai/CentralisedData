        Today I'd like to pay tribute to teachers and students from local schools in my community who take part in school agricultural programs and, in particular, those schools that are actively involved in showing livestock and competing in agricultural shows. These schools include Bonalbo Central School, under teacher Kim James; Woodenbong Central School teachers Stewart Grimmett and

       <p>
        I'm going to give a special shout-out to two local schools who had great success at this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Easter_Show" rel="nofollow">

        in Sydney.

        , under teacher Sally Ford, won two ribbons in the poultry section. The year 9 students raised some

        brown hens as a project after the school was severely damaged by last year's flood. The chooks basically became pampered pets and really impressed the judges of the show. Also winning accolades was Maclean High School, under head teacher
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kirkland" rel="nofollow">

        . They took a team of 19 students and wowed both the judges and crowds with their trade steers and Marlowe Park speckle cattle. Speckle cattle are a relatively new breed to Australia, introduced from Canada just over a decade ago. The judges remarked that the livestock presented by the Maclean High School students were the best line-up of speckle cattle anywhere in the world. They came home with a number of trophies and ribbons, as well as the life experience that helps set up students for the future in the beef industry and/or, indeed, whatever career they may go on to pursue.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can't underestimate the value of the experience gained in the preparation of showing livestock, and cattle in particular. They make it look easy, but there's much work and planning to ensuring the beeves are at their best on the day. There's getting up at the crack of dawn to make the cattle look the best that they can. There are the intricacies of judging. There's performing under pressure before a big crowd and keeping the animals calm. There are the highs and lows of winning and losing and then taking it all in your stride. And after that, if you win, you have public speaking and media interviews.
       </p>
       <p>
        The schools did us proud and on all counts were well rewarded for their dedication and hard work. Again, I congratulate all the schools who were involved in this really important area of education. They deserve to be recognised for their achievement in supporting our much loved agricultural shows and developing the next generation of leaders in the ag sector.
