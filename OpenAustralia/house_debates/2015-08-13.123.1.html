       <p>
        I rise to speak about the incredible privilege I have of serving on the boards of four independent public schools. They are East Kenwick Primary School, Gosnells Primary School, Yule Brook College and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevenoaks_Senior_College" rel="nofollow">
         Sevenoaks Senior College
        </a>
        . By being on the board of those schools, I have seen the incredible capacity of teachers in our public schools to deliver not only educational programs and social and pastoral support but guidance to young people, who rely on the teaching profession to enhance their knowledge and skills so that they can become tremendous citizens of this country in the future—not only in the workforce, of course, but in the social fabric of their community and as leaders of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Equally, I was out at Midvale Primary School last week to witness the launch of a strategy by SNAICC. They launched a concept, 'Little people, big futures'. When we think about our children, they are little. And with the guidance of teachers in our public schools they move through their learning stages of life until they reach a point at which they disengage from school. But by being on the boards of all four of my public schools I see incredible compassion, commitment and the use of limited resources to provide the best possible learning environments and programs that build the capability and capacity of young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I always remain optimistic about the level of commitment that I see in teachers in schools throughout Australia. There are the little things that they do for an individual, where they see the need to reach out and, in a sense, provide a parenting model. Equally, they provide the level of compassion and guidance that shapes of the life of an individual. I certainly recognise that. I can still see my year 1 primary school teacher, who I referred to in my maiden speech—Miss Abernethy—because she guided me through my first years of formative schooling. I often relate my experience with her to that of the teachers who I engage with across my electorate. Often I become disappointed when I hear criticism of teachers, because they have a challenging task not only in providing the teaching that is required to achieve the outcomes for literacy, numeracy and the subjects in which students are engaged but equally they are in many senses the guiding voice that gives the hopes and aspirations to those who come within their care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just want to acknowledge the four schools that I am involved with. But, in particular, I want to acknowledge teachers in public education schools whose endeavours and commitments are outstanding.
