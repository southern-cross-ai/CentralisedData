        On Saturday I attended a bush tucker day with Lakeside Drive Landcare, in Swansea. The Lakeside Drive Landcare site is located on the eastern side of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . It was previously a rich source of food for the Awabakal people and later attracted Chinese fishermen to the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, over a period of time the area became overgrown and it became an eyesore within the community. Then along came the Lakeside Drive Landcare group. It was formed in 2006.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Stewart" rel="nofollow">
         Garry Stewart

        is the team leader and he was joined by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams" rel="nofollow">

        . They were soon followed by many other members who have been involved in working on that site, totally rehabilitating it and putting in place a fantastic walk through the area. The land carers have been involved in weeding, regenerating, planting sections of the reserve in mosaics, constructing informal access paths and erecting nest boxes for birds and possums. You are able to peep through the trees and actually look at the birds when they go into the nesting boxes. It really is a credit to everybody who has been involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Landcare group lists their greatest achievement as controlling lantana and morning glory. Bitou bush, american pennywort, madeira vine, asparagus fern, cassia, mickey mouse plant, glory lily, wild tobacco trees and camphor laurel are also present on the Lakeside Drive site.
       </p>
       <p>
        These volunteers work for hours on this site. They work approximately 90 hours per week. They work every Friday between nine and three and at other times when it is organised. The group are absolutely dedicated to making this area probably one of the most beautiful areas in Lake Macquarie, making it the jewel in the crown! They are friendly to people who visit the area. The group are very proud of their achievements, making such incredible improvements to the site since 2006.
       </p>
       <p>
        I planted a tree on that site when the group first started out. That tree is now growing and looking very healthy. I am sure that has a lot to do with the fact that the group is so dedicated and looks after not only that tree but the whole site. I congratulate the Lakeside Drive Landcare group.
