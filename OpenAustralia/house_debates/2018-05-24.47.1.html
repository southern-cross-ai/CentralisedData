        This weekend thousands of volunteers will be joining the Salvos in knocking on doors for the annual Red Shield Appeal. This is perhaps Australia's best recognised fundraising drive as the appeal has now been in operation for over 50 years. I want to encourage residents in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        to give generously on the weekend and at the collection points that are already in place at local shopping centres.

        does incredible work for those who need a helping hand. The Red Shield Appeal is vital to their efforts to support the most vulnerable in our community. Its community services range from assisting the homeless and helping families in crisis through to emergency and disaster relief. The generosity of Australians during the Red Shield Appeal allows the Salvos to provide in a typical week 100,000 meals for the hungry, 2,000 beds for the homeless, support for a thousand people trying to find work, refuge for 500 people who are the victims of abuse, support for 500 people with addiction problems and aged-care services for nearly 3,000 elderly Australians. I repeat: that is in just one week. The Red Shield Appeal is a major logistical undertaking. I want to thank the many organisations who lend their supportâ€”from Rotary to the thousands of school students who volunteer.

        Today I also want to acknowledge the incredible work of Rob Bagnall, who for more than 10 years has volunteered as the area chair of the appeal for the North Sydney region. He is retiring this year and I was honoured to be asked to become the area chair from next year. I know I have enormous shoes to fill.
