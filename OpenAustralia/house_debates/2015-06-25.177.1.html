       <p>
        On 14 May this year I had the great pleasure of opening the St Bridget's Primary School and it was a tremendous event. I was lucky enough to open it as a result of another great capital grants project for St Brigid's Primary School. It is great to see the school growing and doing so well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of the developments to the school were a testament to all those involved. I would like to thank first of all Mrs Maria Kirkwood, director of the Catholic Education Office, in particular for their contribution of $400,000. I would like to thank the    ninth Bishop of Sale, The Most Reverend Patrick Michael O'Regan, who has just recently moved into Victoria; and The    Very Reverend Peter Slater, parish priest at St Michael's Parish. Peter has been around for a long time and has been doing a great job on the ground. I would also like to thank Mr Ken Gale, principal of St Brigid's Primary School. Ken, you are doing a fantastic job out there with your school students.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge their school captains on the day, Declan Curran and Stephanie Woods. They are great representatives of all of the students of the school. I would like to acknowledge Conor Benson, student religious education leader, for doing a tremendous job.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Michael's Parish made an incredible contribution of $50,000, that went along way to making sure they turned a good school into a great school. It is extra money that makes a huge difference, and it takes me on to talking about the fundraising committee itself at St Brigid's—$80,000. Well done to every person involved. I have been told by the school there are too many people to name, but their contribution to the students and the future students of the school is greatly appreciated by the entire community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to also acknowledge Greg Strickland, the architect from Rahan Construction, and Brendan and Nathan Pryor from Pryor Constructions. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the staff and parents of the St Brigid's community, who have been tremendous supporters of the school. As I said on the day, it is all about the students, and the students have a fantastic school.
       </p>
       <p>
        For your hard work, you have made the school into something very special, and it was a pleasure to officially open the fantastic new facilities. I am very proud to say the Capital Grants Program provided $1.8 million to St Brigid's Primary School, and as part of that they built general learning centres, an external amphitheatre and a multipurpose room which can be used as a chapel, gym or performance centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been lucky enough to open quite a few school developments in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        that have received money through the Australian government's Capital Grants Program. At each of these openings, I have seen a real and tangible achievement for each school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story of St Brigid's is just that. It is a very new school, which opened its doors in 2010 and is growing fast. Inspired by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Brigid" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Brigid
        </a>
        of Kildare, the school community describes her as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A compassionate woman who demonstrated a strong will but also charitable nature. She wanted to help those in need and often handed out bread, butter, eggs and chickens from her father's dairy farm. And she could not bear to see anyone hungry or cold.
       </p>

         Saint Brigid's
        </a>
        life gives the school community many examples of willingness to free people from oppression and poverty. She had a special love of the poor and was renowned for her hospitality. Saint Brigid also founded a school of art at Kildare.
       </p>
       <p>
        When their inspiration is taken into consideration, it is clear to see that St Brigid's have a very strong vision to create a modern, contemporary and innovative approach to learning that is purposeful and relevant to the lives of children and families today. Again, I am incredibly proud to have been part of that very special day, and I would like to thank all those involved.
