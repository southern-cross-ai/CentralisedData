       <p>
        In an ordinary year, being a y ear 12 student is a big deal , layered with many pressures . But this is no ordinary year , and a on ce- in - 100-year s pandemic is an extra layer no student would be prepared for. This is why it's so important that we as governments, schools and communities do everything we can to support our year 12s and give them hope for the wonderful future that lies ahead for each and every one of them. This includes ensuring they can still have their graduations and formals , even if they're a little bit different , because these are what mark the end of 13 years of school ing so students can then move on to the next phase in their lives . Unfortunately, restrictions that have been put in place due to coronavirus means schools have had to cancel or postpone the se celebrations.

        That's why earlier today I convened a teleconference meeting with high - school principals in my community. It's absolutely essential that we understand what students are going through and that we provide the support they need. Some spoke about the uncertaint y students are feeling on top of the additional stresses of the

        . They also spoke about how they could confidently hold graduations in a COVID-safe way. I encourage the

        government to help provide solutions to our schools, t o help them navigate these challenges a nd to offer the best outcomes for students in this very important year. Thank you to the principals who took part in our discussion today . To all our year 12 students : w e are here to support you.
