       <p>
        Last Saturday, I had the pleasure of joining members of the South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club as they celebrated their 95th anniversary. The club was formed in 1923 by former members of the

         North Narrabeen
        </a>
        surf club

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_McLean" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Norman Cox. Land was donated to the club and a new clubhouse erected on the site, with the new club officially opened on 15 December 1923. Originally the club was to be called Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club, but after protests from North Narrabeen the name South Narrabeen was adopted. The sporting newspaper

        recorded that in its first years South Narrabeen was affectionately known as the baby club of the metropolis but that members lost no time in becoming a part of the surf life saving community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to congratulate everyone on the executive who was part of making Saturday night so successful, including President Martin Hayward, Sarah Oaten,

        </a>
        , Rohan Fisher, Jake Warner, Kylie Ryder, Marnie Gordon, Mark Dimento and Zoe Hodges. Not to be forgotten is life member and club stalwart Tony Haven AM, who has given so much to the club and surf life saving over the years. I would especially like to congratulate Chica O'Reilly and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Clarke
        </a>
        for their 70-year service medals. Both Chica and Peter have been stalwarts of the club, and their service over so many years should be an inspiration to all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet the service of this club goes far beyond the northern beaches. Since the inception of Bush to Beach in 2016, Ken Passmore and Jack Cannons AM have worked tirelessly to raise funds in our community so the Brewarrina community in remote outback
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        can bring 50 Aboriginal students and their carers to Narrabeen Beach to familiarise them with the beach and talk about water safety. The program aims to encourage school attendance and reward hardworking students with a weekend at the beach. It creates a bridge from what is too often a disadvantaged present and a bleak future to a world of possibilities. Without the support of South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club Sadly and its members, the remarkable event would not be possible. Sadly, this year's event is under a cloud as the necessary funds to provide transport from Brewarrina may not be found. I hope grants and funding will be soon found to allow the event to proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I once again congratulate the South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club on their successful event and the 95th anniversary. On behalf of the community, I thank you for 95 years of service protecting our beaches. I have every confidence that you will be here long into the future.
