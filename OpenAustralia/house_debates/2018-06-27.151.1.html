        On Sunday, 17 June, I attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Christopher's" rel="nofollow">
         St Christopher's
        </a>
        Cricket Club presentation day at Panania Diggers. It was a great presentation that was very well attended. St Christopher's is a very strong club in our community and it has been in existence for some 35 years. On the day, I presented Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards to Matthew Fitzgerald, Daniel Louka, Ryan Klem,

        , Thomas Tiberti and Raoul Konia, all of whom had remarkable achievements. There was a hat-trick in there and several centurions. There were fantastic achievements from the kids at St Christopher's Cricket Club. I'd like to thank the club's President,

        , Vice-President Paul Collins, Secretary Andrew Divan and Treasurer John Grealy for everything that they do to create such a special club in our community. I'd also like to thank Panania Diggers—Gary Murray and everyone at Panania Diggers—for their ongoing support of not just St Christopher's Cricket but so many sporting clubs in our community.

        On 12 June, I attended the Oatley Lions Club board meeting. There was a lot of planning going on for this year's spring event—the Oatley Village Festival. It's a big event in our community every year, and, for some 20 years, Bryan Pirie has been organising it along with his fellow Lions. Oatley Lions is a very important group in our community. Many thousands of people attend the annual festival, and the club has raised more than $170,000 in the last five years for local and international community projects. This year the festival will be held on 20 October, and the club is expecting over 180 food, craft and variety stalls and lots of local performers as well. Thanks to Bryan Pirie for all his efforts, and congratulations to the new club President,

        On 13 June, I attended the Oatley Probus Club. It was great to catch up with the members, President Annie Organ, Secretary Lesley Mannion and the many other volunteers who are involved in this Probus club. Right across the Banks electorate, we have a very active Probus community—very active indeed. Probus is all about friendship, fellowship and fun, and all of those things were in evidence on this day at Oatley Probus. The group has a monthly meeting with guest speakers and lots of outings. There's a regular walking group; there are theatre parties and a lot more. Thanks to everyone at Oatley Probus for their efforts in our community, and thank you also to the broader Probus community in our area.
