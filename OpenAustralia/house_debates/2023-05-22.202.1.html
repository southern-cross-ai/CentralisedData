        Volunteers are the backbone of our communities. 'Robbo keeps the footy club alive. She is the heart and soul of the club,' so says the Braybrook Football Club president, Robyn Cowell, winner of the inaugural Volunteer of Fraser award, part of National Volunteer Week, which ended yesterday. Robyn works full-time in aged care but regularly puts in 12-hour days on the weekendsâ€”managing the teams, working in the canteen and behind the bar, preparing the playing kit, organising club functions and so much more.

        Nazish Rafique, meanwhile, lives her ethos of sharing is caring. Nazish has spent years cooking endless meals through her involvement with Duke Street Community House, Maidstone Community Centre and also the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Nazish was particularly busy during the height of the pandemic, cooking and delivering food to international students, to COVID-positive people and to people who are homeless and more.

        Last but not least, 23-year-old Darvey Toe was the recipient of the Young Volunteer of Fraser award. She has been involved for nearly a decade with 100 Story Building, which helps with the creativity, literacy and confidence of some of the most disadvantaged young people in my community.
       </p>

        Without these volunteers, festivals, social events, sports, food banks and more simply would not happen. Thank you again to all the volunteers for Fraser and to the community more broadly.
