        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the government building the future Australian economy by delivering tax cuts, especially for small businesses? When it comes to supporting the nation's small businesses, what is the choice before the parliament today?

         I thank the member for his question. Every time I have visited his electorate we have had the opportunity to talk to a wide range of people, whether they be
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         volunteers or people who work for the local council or local ministers. But we have also spoken to a large number of businesspeople in his electorate. The member understands, as I understand and as the government understands, that right around the nation there are Australians working hard to build their own small businesses and that for many working people their highest aspiration is to own and operate their own small business. So I was very pleased today to be able to announce that the government will create a small business commissioner.
        </p>
        <p>
         Small businesses, unlike bigger businesses, do not have the resources to engage with government. They find it more difficult to get the information that they need, because they simply do not have the time; they are so focused on their business. This Small Business Commissioner will be a one-stop shop for advice and information for small businesses and will be a persistent advocate within government for approaches that will be good for small business. It is a measure which stands alongside having a minister for small business at the cabinet table so that those 2.7 million small businesses around the nation which employ half of the Australians employed in our nation today and are worth a third of our economic activity can be represented in the way that they should be.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am also very pleased and proud to report to the House that we on this side of the parliament stand for a tax cut for small businesses and a tax cut for all businesses. We stand for reducing the company tax rate for small businesses on 1 July this year. We stand for ensuring that they can have an instant asset write-off of $6,500 so that they can buy new capital for their business and it can be tax effective for them. We stand too for making sure that they can buy motor vehicles for their business and have a $5,000 benefit.

            It has become clear today that those on that side of the parliament stand against all of these measures. The Leader of the Opposition said today that he will vote against tax cuts for all businesses in this nation. It is heresy to what the Liberal Party has always believed in to vote against tax cuts for businesses.

We know where the Leader of the Opposition stands: for the billionaires and for the betrayal of businesses and working people around our nation.
