       <p>
        When I was looking to write a speech reviewing 2023, I saw that the global headlines have, sadly, brought pain and despair on a daily basis. Russia's war on Ukraine continues and the harrowing stories of the Israel-Hamas conflict continue to fill the pages of our newspapers, and they are on repeat on 24-hour news channels. A world is suffering economic uncertainty, and strategic flux continues to affect hundreds of millions. Here at home, we've also felt the global economic aftershocks, with cost-of-living pressures continuing to challenge Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        But with all the trouble in the world we also have many reasons to be thankful. I'd like to mention some award-winning Tasmanians who are working wonders to help their community at home. The Tasmanian Young Achiever Awards took place in May. Young Tasmanian Isabella Dewar from Burnie is a certified karate instructor at just 16. She was recognised for offering free self-defence classes to kids and adults who have been bullied. Gavin Yi Feng Quek, aged 25, of

        is a dentist who is helping improve oral health awareness among Tasmanians. He volunteers with the Red Cross's bicultural health program, educating refugees on oral health. Kitana Mansell, aged 22, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risdon_Cove" rel="nofollow">

        is strengthening her community by sharing cultural knowledge. A proud Palawa woman, Kitana manages Palawa Kipli, the first

        food business.

       <p>
        Tasmanian business The Udder Way was acknowledged for its work in sustainability at the Tasmanian Community Achievement Awards. It is eliminating the need for single-use plastics in the dairy farming industry. In my own electorate, Cressy's Tasmanian Quality Meats was named Tasmanian exporter of the year earlier this month and is a national finalist in this year's Australian Export Awards, taking place right here in the parliament in the

        </a>
        on Thursday evening. It's one of many businesses in my electorate showcasing the very best Tasmanian produce on the world stage. This family-run business processes quality Tasmanian lamb, mutton and veal Australia-wide and for numerous international markets. I look forward to catching up with them on Thursday.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge Sea Forest from being named a finalist in the prodigious Earthshot Prize for 2023. Based at Triabunna on Tasmania's east coast, Sea Forest is dedicated to fighting climate change by being the first in the world to cultivate
        <i>
         Asparagopsis
        </i>
        at a commercial scale and by producing livestock supplements. I'm thrilled that, as a finalist for the Fix Our Climate Earthshot Prize, the revolutionary work of Sam and the team at Sea Forest is being recognised globally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the vineyards in Lyons have also had international success. I don't think it's well known outside Tasmania that it's a fantastic place for wine, but it is. Tolpuddle vineyard, for example, took out the Australian red wine, the Australian red trophy and the Australian pinot noir trophy, along with a gold medal at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Wine_Challenge" rel="nofollow">
         International Wine Challenge
        </a>
        in London earlier this year. I'm going to run out of time, so I can't name all the others, but there's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Spring Vale
        </a>
        , Stefano Lubiana, Bream Creek, Meadowbank, Freycinet and others that have all won big awards, and there's no way I'll have time to mention the many distilleries across Lyons that are winning international awards; I've simply run out of time. Many across my electorate are absolutely smashing it. We're really showing the Scots how to distil whiskey. I know that's a controversial comment, but it's true.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to mention Stephanie Trethewey, who is from the Dunorlan. She was named the 2024 Tasmanian Australian of the Year. She's a rural women's advocate and founder of the nationwide charity Motherland, which does great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to end my speech by acknowledging three Tasmanians whom we've lost: Lindsay Birch, Lyn Rigby and Rhonda Foster from Bagdad, who died just this week. All three of them were tireless volunteers for their clubs and their communities. They were just amazing people. They illustrate the volunteering spirit that is found right across my electorate. There are many wonderful people who've left us this year whom I don't have time to name, but those three in particular stand out to me. They shared a passion for volunteering and a deep sense of community.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the people who help keep us safe—the police; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        ; the water rescuers; the firies; the ambos; the defence services, cadets and reserves; the volunteer and service organisations; the food banks; the folk who extend a helping hand or a comforting word—I say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your dedication to community. I'm sure I share the wishes of the parliament. In case I don't get to speak again before the House rises for the year, a very merry Christmas and a happy and safe new year to you all.
