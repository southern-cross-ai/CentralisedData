        Mr Deputy Speaker, did you know that there are more than 40 million songs in circulation around the world today? If you tried to listen to them back to back, you would be listening for over 200 years. It is a disconcerting thought to consider how much music we will never get to hearâ€”and, indeed, the opportunity cost of having listened to so much Nickelback, when I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, that all you want to listen to is

        Thankfully, a Brisbane business, Nightlife Music, has a democratic solution to the issue of the songs playing at your local pub, your gym or even a sporting stadium. Their music archives are so grand and their technology so good that they have just partnered with Spotify to roll out their product crowdDJ.

        I recently met with Mark, Stuart, Phil and the team at their headquarters in Milton. They have taken their business from just two people to over 120 employees in about 30 years.

        They have benefited greatly from this government's R&amp;D tax incentives, and they are now engaging with this government's innovation agenda. And I should add that they will benefit, incidentally, from stopping Labor's lockout laws in Queensland's pubs and clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to be working hard for businesses like them and, as a result of the meeting, I am now a proud member of the Parliamentary Friends of Music, led by the member for Boothby. It is, Mr Deputy Speaker, a Nickelback-free zone.
