        I have often bragged about how much food is grown in the Mallee, but people do not think of the electorate of Mallee as the place to come for an air show. But last Saturday the Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre hosted their air show, and we had over 5,000 people turn up; 140-plus planes flew in and I, as a bit of a hack aviator, flew my little lawnmower engine plane in and landed. We had the Roulettes there, we had World War

        I just want to say: isn't it so good that one of our rural communities, a town of about 2,000 people, could attract 5,000 people to an event and highlight some of our history and some of those great things? To stand there and watch the amazement on the eyes of country kids, seeing the Roulettes fly in formation overhead, made us very proud.

        Nhill is well known for its integration of the Karen refugees. They had their displays of things that they were making. There was food being served and it was just a real example of a vibrant rural town holding a great event. Well done to the committee who organised it, and well done to the township of Nhill. You put us on the map once again, not only for your tolerance with the refugees but now for Australia's second greatest air show next to Avalon. It will be on again, so I encourage people to come along if they get that opportunity.
