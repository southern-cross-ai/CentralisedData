       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to call for a raising of the standards in our politics from the point of view of gender. We have at the desk here with us today, fortuitously, the member for Ryan, who has been an adornment to this parliament, who is highly respected and valued and who has raised the standards of civility and bipartisanship. She has been a wonderful colleague and she does not deserve to receive the treatment she has received. In my region we are now seeing the same forces lining up against the member for Gilmore.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you look at the proportion on the other side, there is 22 per cent female representation, and apparently they are going backwards. I compare that to the ability of our side to hit the 45 per cent target. We will achieve 50 per cent in the years to come. It shows it can be done. It shows, too, with the member for Ryan's contribution, what women will bring to this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also understand this is part of an ideological battleâ€”the far Right are trying to remove those voices of reason and moderation in the party room. I would ask them to reverse their field on that. Otherwise, this community will judge them very harshly on ignoring these gender balance issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've heard from the member for Indi. We have heard from my colleague the member for Canberra, who has done a fantastic job in this place. Treating this issue seriously will improve the standard of our parliament and improve the civility of our discussion. I would ask the coalition to wake up to themselves on this. It's not too late. Take some serious action and look after the women in this community.
