        Right now it's hard to think of a more-beautiful two-word sentence than '4-0'. Last night, I congratulated the Matildas on their extraordinary result against the Olympic champions, Canada. I had some friendly banter with my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau" rel="nofollow">
         Justin Trudeau

        , the

        </a>
        . It was a remarkable result in front of a packed

        Park in Melbourne, which was a small fraction of the record audience that watched last night. I congratulate the entire team, and particularly the goal scorers. Hayley Raso got two, Mary Fowler got one and maybe should have got another one, and Steph Catley, the captain, closed the deal with that late penalty. Australia is so proud of the Matildas. The good thing occurring here is that it isn't just a sporting event; it is an inspiration, particularly for young girls and young women. We look forward to the next match.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate the Diamonds on their win against Scotland in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" rel="nofollow">

        in the Netball World Cup. The skipper, Liz Watson, and her team are undefeated. When I was growing up it was pretty hard to envisage a team sport played by women being on peak

        times. The world has changed, and that is a very good thing. I wish these two great teams all the best in the remaining days and, hopefully, weeks of the World Cup.

         I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the Matildas. Obviously, as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
          PM
         </a>
         points out, it was a tremendous sporting event with individual contributions but an enormous amount of work done behind the scenes by coaching staff and all of the administrators who are there performing at an exceptional level and providing an inspiration to a generation of young girls who could never have envisaged such heroes and such an influence on their lives. It's a remarkable event, and everyone now waits with great anxiety until next Monday night. We wish the Matildas well in their preparation for that game, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         I acknowledge the wonderful efforts of the Diamonds, as the Prime Minister pointed out. All of us continue to watch their success. I obviously acknowledge the work of the Australian team in the Ashes series. Some of us are a little bleary-eyed this morning and are glad that we might finally get a full night's sleep tonight. I congratulate them for that series win. It has been a very entertaining five-match series. I think most people are pretty exhausted but exhilarated off the back of the Matildas' performance last night.
