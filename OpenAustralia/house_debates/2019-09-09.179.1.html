        There is a range of committee groups across my electorate of Robertson. Recently I had the privilege of going back to the small but very beautiful riverside town of Spencer. It was a fantastic afternoon to celebrate and unveil the new outdoor furniture that we funded as part of round 4 of the Stronger Communities Program. Locals from Gunderman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisemans_Ferry" rel="nofollow">
         Wisemans Ferry
        </a>
        travelled along the river for the occasion. We gathered under the Spencer tree, which is known to locals as the Dunkirk Hotel, for some great conversation, amazing food and also to enjoy the new furniture. Funding through the Stronger Communities Program meant that the Spencer Community Progress Group and the Wisemans Ferry Men's Shed were able to build and install the new furniture for everyone to be able to enjoy, and it really does look amazing. In fact, some of the original furniture that was there some decades ago has actually remained.

        I pay tribute to Robyn Downham for putting on this event and for her tireless advocacy for the Spencer community and to the President of the Spencer Community Progress Group, Brad Maisey. To the Wisemans Ferry Men's Shed, led by President Adrian Acheson, thank you for designing and constructing the new table. A special thank you goes to Adam Dayes who served us incredible food at the Dunkirk Hotel. This is a great reminder of how this program is supporting communities and helping to bring people together. Over the last couple of weeks we've been consulting with the community about round 5 of the program, and there have been a number of wonderful applications. I look forward to another successful round and to updating the House.
