        In a gymnasium in Seoul rows of trainers, high heels, jackets and Halloween accessories lie spread out on the floor. They are all numbered in the hope that their owners will come to collect them, but many may never be claimed. These items belong to victims and survivors of the recent crowd crush in Seoul, which tragically claimed the lives of 156 people. Many of those injured and those who tragically passed had chosen to simply have a night out, to dress up and celebrate Halloween in the Itaewon nightlife district, many likely heading there for the first time since the pandemic. This was a night intended to celebrate fun and friendship, but one that we know ended in tragedy.

        community. Because of their efforts locals, including me, were able to pay their respects to the souls of those who tragically passed. From 9 am to 9 pm hundreds of people laid white flowers in front of a makeshift shrine in Eastwood Plaza. Hundreds of locals were also able to sign a condolence book, which I understand will be sent back to Itaewon.
       </p>
       <p>
        My heart goes out to those mourning the loss of loved ones due to this tragedy and my thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of those impacted during this difficult time. Itaewon he sang ja ted-eh. May the victims of Itaewon rest in peace.
