        I rise today to say thank you to the Prime Minister and his executive for announcing this week that the federal government will do a city deal with South-East Queensland. There's no doubt that this government is already delivering enormously for South-East Queensland, but there's more to do. We have to ensure that we stay ahead of the population curve in one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. We have to ensure that, while we respect each distinct community and their needs, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        to the Sunny Coast and from Ipswich to Toowoomba, we also need to improve the connectivity across those communities, across South-East Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's where a city deal comes in. It's vitally important to have a future vision for what South-East Queensland needs to be and a road map to get there. And the only way to do that is in a united fashion, where you have all three tiers of government—local councils, the state government and the federal government—working as one on a set deal process. That's the only way too that we can maximise the gains for residents and unlock private capital to make it happen. Today is a big day, because I can get on my feet and celebrate that an
