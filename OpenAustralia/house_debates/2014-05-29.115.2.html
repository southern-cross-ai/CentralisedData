        The Minister for Foreign Affairs asserted in question time on 26 May and again on 28 May and again today—and the Treasurer asserted today—that I had personally said that Labor would be putting an extra $16 billion into the aid budget. The facts are these: I said that the coalition's decision on aid would reduce the aid budget by $16 billion because it abandoned the previously bipartisan commitment that aid would reach 0.5 per cent of gross national income. I have stated that our commitment to reaching the 0.5 per cent target remains but that the eventual cost will depend on timing and any further changes made by the coalition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to talk about two great organisations. The first is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides
        </a>
        Australia. The Guiding movement supports girls and young women to grow into confident, self-respecting, responsible members of the community. Guides are girls and young women who take action on issues that are important to them—important in their communities and important to the world. They seek to understand the world, its peoples and its cultures. The modern Guiding movement embodies the same determination that led to the formation of the Girl Guides over a century ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        n 1909 the Girl Guides 'crashed' the first Boy Scout Rally at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace" rel="nofollow">
         Crystal Palace
        </a>
        , attracting the attention of Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell. They asked him to offer 'something for girls too'. In 1910 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides Association
        </a>
        was formed—a separate organisation for girls—led by Agnes Baden-Powell, Robert Baden-Powell's sister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then the Guiding movement has made important contributions to the advancement of women and girls locally, nationally and internationally. For the past 57 years, Australian Girl Guides have been raising funds by selling biscuits, and they are doing it again this year. This year Girl Guides hope to sell more than 13 million biscuits, and to raise more than $1.7 million. The money is used to help fund local guiding activities, camps and events, purchase guiding supplies and program materials, and support disadvantaged girls to enjoy guiding. I know members opposite would have received a complimentary packet of Guides biscuits. I hope they were well enjoyed. Many have told me that they were delicious.
       </p>
       <p>
        One terrific Girl Guides project that I have seen first-hand is the work Guides are doing making breast care bags. These beautiful bags have been made by members of the Girl Guides in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        as a service project. The bags hold drains and allow more freedom of movement for patients after breast surgery. Last month I was very pleased to accept a donation of these breast care bags from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides Australia
        </a>
        on behalf of the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse. I would like to table an explanation of what the bags do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is a perfect introduction to the second excellent organisation I want to speak about today—the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Prince_Alfred_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
        </a>
        in Camperdown. A key priority of the former Labor government was to ensure that Australia became a world leader in cancer care. Between 2007 and 2013 Labor invested $4.1 billion in initiatives to support better prevention, detection, screening and treatment of cancer. We also made an unprecedented investment in research into the prevention and treatment of cancer. The outcome of our investment was profound—Australia's overall cancer survival rates are now the best in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 2008 and 20I3 the Labor government contributed $169.5 million in funding to build the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse. Of course, the fundraising done by the community was also magnificent. It was a magnificent effort by the community and the government working together to build an integrated cancer centre, delivering a range of vital services in the one location, including clinical care, surgery, medical and radiation oncology, research, integrative medicine, and support services for patients, their families and carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lifehouse is part of a national network of wonderful facilities that are ensuring better outcomes for people living with cancer and better support for the people who love them. It is a great example of over 220 projects funded by Labor's Nation Building Health and Hospitals Fund. Health and Hospitals Fund projects are now providing vital health services right across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased to have been able to speak today about two wonderful organisations—Girl Guides and Chris O'Brien Lifehouse—that are working together to contribute to a better, more caring community.
