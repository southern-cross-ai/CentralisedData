       <p>
        Through this very challenging year, dedicated community leaders in Moncrieff have been serving our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        community to address its immediate and future needs. Thank you to the members of the City Heart Taskforce and the Moncrieff community cabinet for your leadership in Moncrieff in the community through this difficult year. I'd also like to acknowledge the Gold Coast business leaders for the resilience that you have displayed in the face of the pandemic's economic impact. Not only have you shown the fortitude to deal with the immediate impacts but also to plan for a bright future. That determination was on show when we gathered at the Reimagine forum back in August as you began the recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my coalition colleagues, I acknowledge your professionalism, your friendship and highly effective response to the pandemic. To everyone in this place, we don't always agree—nor do I–on the how of serving the Australian people but there is no doubt that we share a commitment to wanting the best for all of our nation's people. To all of the community groups that serve Moncrieff—there are too many to mention—your volunteer work has eased the burden and brightened the world for so many Gold Coasters—well done to you. To the good people of Moncrieff, I commend you for your determination, discipline, hard work, good humour and for your care for your families and communities. I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and let's all look forward to a much brighter 2021.
