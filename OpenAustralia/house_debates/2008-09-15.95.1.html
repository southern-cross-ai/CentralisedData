        Three weeks ago I had the opportunity, together with the Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliott, to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Munro" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Prestons for his volunteer work for the elderly at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Hills
        </a>
        Retirement Village, an aged-care facility in my electorate. Mr Munro was presented with the Australian government community service plaque, which is an award for people who have made an outstanding contribution and provided service to older Australians, or for older Australians who provide outstanding community service. The award was actually presented in front of his own community at the Blue Hills Retirement Village.

        As I said, the award is designed to recognise people for their contributions and outstanding efforts in their own particular field. Mr Munro was a very worthy recipient of the award. He is a great inspiration to his local community. Personally I know that Blue Hills and the wider local community value the contributions he has made over many years, particularly in relation to causes such as Daffodil Day and Bandaged Bear Day. He was also a volunteer at the

        </a>
        . Mr Munro was an organiser with the

        and, in his retirement, has continued to represent his community in the best way he sees fit. He has certainly been a valuable member of the Blue Hills Retirement Village, one who has actually played a constant role in putting the views of his community firstâ€”
