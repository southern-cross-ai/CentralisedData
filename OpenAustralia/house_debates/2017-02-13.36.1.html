       <p>
        Melville Senior High School in my electorate is an independent public school, recognised for their gifted and talented programs and their aviation studies, graphic design, media and music in focus specialty courses. One-third of the students participate in the performing arts program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state Liberal government has committed more than half a billion dollars in major upgrades to WA schools from the proceeds of the sale of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Western Power
        </a>
        . Melville Senior High School will receive $10 million towards upgrades, including a new performing arts centre of excellence. The current performing arts space is nowhere near large enough for friends, families, students and the local community to view productions.

        colleague,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Matt Taylor
        </a>
        , has been fighting for these upgrades for some time. He has worked closely with principal, Phillip White, and acting principal, Kylie Bottcher. He has championed the cause with education minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Collier" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Collier
        </a>
        , and spoken on the issue in parliament. His passion for education and commitment to his community has delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        WA Labor has pledged an inadequate $4.5 million, an amount that will not get the project built. Typical Labor: only doing half the job. The local community has a clear choice about who is best for their local community and can say yes to the new centre for arts excellence by ensuring the re-election of local Liberal member, Matt Taylor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, Matt, on your great advocacy for your community. You know how to deliver for your electorate.
