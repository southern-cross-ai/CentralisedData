       Dear Mr Murphy

       Petitionâ€”Australia Post Shop at Darch, Western Australia
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 16 March 2011, concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding the establishment of an Australia Post Shop at the Darch Plaza Shopping Centre in Western Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australian Post has advised that in determining whether additional retail postal outlets are justified, it takes a number of factors into account including the location and viability of existing outlets and the volume of business likely to be transacted. The Corporation also has a national Community Service Obligation performance standard that in metropolitan areas at least 90 per cent of residences should be within 2.5 kilometres of a retail outlet.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has reviewed the distribution of postal outlets in the general area around Darch. I understand that there are two retail postal outlets in the area: the Kingsway Licensed Post Office (LPO) is less than 2.5 kilometres from Darch and the Alexander Heights LPO less than 1.5 kilometres distance. Australia Post has noted its concern at the potential impact of a new outlet on the viability of the existing outlets in the area.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post is unable to support the request for an additional postal outlet at this stage. However, it will continue to monitor its facilities in the area to ensure it is meeting the requirements of the local community.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy
