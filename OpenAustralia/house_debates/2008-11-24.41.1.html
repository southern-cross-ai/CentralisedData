         I thank the member for Bendigo for his question and his longstanding interest in matters with respect to the veterans community. I had the honour and privilege of representing the government and the parliament overseas recently at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Armistice Day
         </a>
         ceremonies in Europe. I was accompanied by the shadow minister, the member for Greenway. We were also there with the Governor-General. I have been gladdened by the reports that I have received from members in the House on both sides about the success of the commemorations here in Australia and reports of attendances of over 3,000 at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         , and also at other ceremonies throughout the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Europe" rel="nofollow">
          In Europe
         </a>
         , the focus was very much on the 90th anniversary of the armistice. Although it is a time to remember that almost a million Australians have served overseas and some 102,000-plus have, if you like, suffered the ultimate sacrifice, I think it is also important at this time to remember particularly what occurred at the time of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
          Great War
         </a>
         so long ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of ceremonies in Europe, the Governor-General led the Australian delegation with respect to the principal French ceremonies at Paris and Verdun. The shadow minister, amongst others, and a delegation of veterans’ leaders attended a function at the Australian National Memorial at Villiers-Bretonneux. I had the privilege of being at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menin_Gate" rel="nofollow">
          Menin Gate
         </a>
         on what was a particularly cold Flanders day, a day which I can imagine was not unlike what our troops had to deal with so long ago.

         It is 90 years since the end of the war that was meant to end all wars—90 years from when, I think it can be argued, Australia was at its zenith in terms of international influence with respect to the events of that time. In 1918, the circumstances were that the Australian forces led the charge in a number of major battles which were effectively the basis which led to the armistice. They were joined by many others—the British, the Canadians, the Indians and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealanders
         </a>
         —but with respect to a number of particular battles in that time, Australians served their country exceptionally well. Villiers-Bretonneux, which I had the privilege of leading a delegation to for Anzac Day earlier this year, was the site of a battle which stemmed the tide of the push towards Amiens by the Germans as part of their spring offensive of 1918. Then battles like

          Le Hamel
         </a>
         , Amiens,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_St_Quentin" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and Peron stand in the history of our country—a history of great courage and great bravery.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also had the honour to attend the rededication of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Corps" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Corps
         </a>
         Memorial at Le Hamel on 8 November. The Le Hamel memorial, unfortunately, was in some disrepair but it is an impressive memorial. I note the member for Maranoa is present. He was minister at the time it was originally dedicated. The Corps Memorial commemorates the exploits of the Australian Corps right the way through, but its location at Le Hamel in itself is quite significant. Le Hamel was the first battle led by General Sir John Monash as the head of the Australian Corps. It was a battle that was timed to the nth degree. Monash timed it to go for only 90 minutes. He got it wrong. It went 93 minutes.

           There is an argument there. What you can say with respect to what occurred on that occasion is that the combination of the use of armour, air and land forces was very much a template for battles later on which led to the wind-back through to the Hindenburg line and eventually, if you like, the terms towards the armistice.
          </p>
          <p>
           It was a very great honour and a privilege, as I said, to be there on this occasion and to share this occasion with my colleagues. It is a very important time to remember those who fought and died not only in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
            World War I

           but also in conflicts since. It is a time to remember that we have a proud history, but we also have to remember so many who died in the cause of freedom and also those who serve today on our behalf.
