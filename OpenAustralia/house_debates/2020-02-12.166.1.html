       <p>
        I'm here today to congratulate the students and staff of Devonport High School in my electorate of Braddon, who were recently announced as the 2019 national Anzac Day Schools' Awards winners. Devonport High's Anzac Day assembly was entitled 'It Touched us All',and it began with Mrs Jolly and her drama students reading letters from the front line. The realism of what families, soldiers and loved ones would have been feeling helped the audience to connect with the experiences of all involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two grade 10 students, Jaden Armstrong and Elyjah Slater, were army and navy cadets themselves. They formed a catafalque party. They marched from the rear of the assembled group and raised the national flag in the spotlight on the stage. They stood to attention and proudly recited for the remainder of the assembly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The student representative council performed a welcome to country, introduced the national anthem singers and went on to explain the significance of Anzac Day. Two students, Dylan Boys and Bronte Dykstra, then performed the Redgum classic 'I was only 19', which was heartfelt and moving. This was followed by the inaugural performance of the junior band playing 'On The March', led by Mrs Gail Elliott. Class captains then laid rosemary and poppies under a wreath on behalf of their classmates. The significance of the rosemary, the poppies and 'The Last Post' were relayed to the audience, and this was well received. 'The Last Post' was then performed and 'The Ode' from

        was read before students and staff shared their stories on how their lives had been impacted by war.
       </p>
       <p>
        Student Bronte Dykstra then introduced her grandmother—and my own dear friend and former colleague—Mrs Libby Perkins, who told her story of being a decoder in the

        at age 17. Mrs Perkins detailed the secrecy surrounding her role and her recognition, 30 years after the event, that saw her go on to become head of the

       </p>
       <p>
        The Grade 10 dance class then brought the assembly to an emotional end, performing '

        '. The judges praised the school's entry as a 'heartwarming performance, captured in song, poetry and storytelling.' They went on to say that they were 'impressed at the commemoration, and this was evident in the student driven and beautifully captured two-minute presentation.' As an ex-serviceman myself, I was overwhelmed and deeply proud and touched by how this younger generation is embracing and demonstrating active care and selfless sacrifice for the defence of our nation. Congratulations, Devonport High, and lest we forget.
