        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his commitment of two years and five months ago to sever all ties between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and the militant union bosses
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Reynolds" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         Joe McDonald

         Western Australian
        </a>
        branch of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Engineering Union, and I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … when it comes to the way in which we conduct our political campaigns, we’re not going to obtain campaign finance from such individuals and the parts of the union movement which they represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the Prime Minister confirm the statement this week by Mr Reynolds that the Western Australian branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        has donated $80,000 a year to the Labor Party since the Prime Minister’s commitment? Will the Prime Minister refund these donations or is this just another Labor broken promise?

         I think the honourable member would be familiar with the fact that the likes of

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was not asked about his friendship with these individuals. He was asked about whether he would take their money.

           <p>
            I understand the news from today is that the construction division of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
             CFMEU
            </a>
            has finally seen the light and withdrawn from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            altogether, which, from my own point of view, is good news all round—in terms of its affiliation, that is. On the question of campaign donations, those questions should be directed to the national secretary of the party. If the honourable member seriously expects the leader of any political party to have available to him details concerning campaign finance, there would be a very interesting set of questions which I would then have directed to the Leader of the Opposition. For example, how much money from the tobacco lobby has been given to the Liberal Party in the last year and the year before that and the year before that? We have been engaged in a debate led by the member for Dickson of late about the future of public health. One of the key elements of that is preventative health strategies and yet we have one participant in the debate, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Liberal Party of Australia
            </a>
            , which says, ‘Oh, we can participate in this debate with clean hands,’ while raking in the money from big tobacco on the way through. I would suggest: ‘Physician heal thyself.’
