        I want to tell the parliament why I love Paniyiri. Paniyiri is a wonderful Greek festival held every year in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musgrave_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Musgrave Park
        </a>
        . It was an honour to attend yesterday's official proceedings as the local member and representing the Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        . It is Queensland's largest and longest-running cultural festival. This week's festival was the 39th. Over 600,000 people visit Musgrave Park in my electorate for Paniyiri every year—sorry, 60,000. I wish it were 600,000—it would be if it could be. It is a great festival. You cannot talk about Paniyiri without mentioning food. I am told that since it began Paniyiri has served more than four million honey puffs, 320,000 coffees, 20 tonnes of haloumi, 3.75 million souvlaki and 600,000 dolmades. I can vouch for the honey puffs—they are excellent. As the community uses Paniyiri as an opportunity to fund raise for not-for-profits, eating honey puffs is an altruistic act, which is one of the great things about the festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paniyiri is a great opportunity to enjoy Greek culture. This year there were more than 20 hours of entertainment on the main stage alone like Greek Dancing with the Stars, the Zorba-thon and the return of the competition for Best Greek Barista. The community always looks outwards. Last year I was quite surprised to see a number of Brazilian dancers next to the Greek dances. The costumes were quite different but it was wonderful to see. This year, being the 100th anniversary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        , we had more of a serious tone. The community marked the 100th anniversary and Commander Peter Tedman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        was there to take part in the acknowledgement, as was the Queensland detachment of the Royal Australian Navy Band. As always, they were fantastic.
       </p>
       <p>
        The south side has always had a really strong Greek connection. It is absolutely wonderful for me as their representative to share in that culture. We have had a lot of Greek migrants who have settled on the south side and started businesses. We have some Greek restaurants which rival those in Melbourne and the community leadership has been an integral part of the ongoing success of multiculturalism in Queensland, including through the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland, a wonderful organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paniyiri is a festival that is really based in the community. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox
        </a>
        community of St George hosts Paniyiri and works with government and private sponsors to get the financial backing they need to make it happen. I went on the weekend just gone. As always, it was an honour to spend time with Father Dimitri and Father Anastasios, two wonderful priests of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox Church
        </a>
        , who always give wonderful and moving services. I also acknowledge the community of St George leaders Michael Anastas, Sam Pavouris, Freda Valassakis and Peter Dinoris. I thank each of them for being so welcoming to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate festival chairman Chris Kazonis, who is already organising the 40th anniversary, the Greek Club and the thousands of volunteers involved. It was a wonderful festival and I cannot wait for next year.
