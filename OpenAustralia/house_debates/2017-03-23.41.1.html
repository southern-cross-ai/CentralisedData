        I rise today to express my condolences for those killed this morning outside Westminster, to share my hope that those injured recover quickly and to admire the character of Londoners as they overcome this terrible event. As I do so, I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         High Commissioner
        </a>
        from Britain to Australia, Her Excellency Menna Rawlings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Britain is obviously a country with which we have a great affinity. I spent two years of my life living in Britain, like many Australians who have spent time in that country. So many of the freedoms that we enjoy today in Australia were fought for, won and defended at Westminster. I think it says everything about the strength of the democratic will and about British determination in the face of challenge that the House of Commons and the House of Lords will resume their business at their regular time tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today all of us in this place should take inspiration from their strength in the face of terror and from how Londoners rush to help each other in times of danger. I am sure we all hope to never have need to show that strength here and that we do not have such an event here. I am also sure we all hope that, if that moment were to come, we would show the character of the member of the House of Commons Tobias Ellwood and his determination to help those around him.
