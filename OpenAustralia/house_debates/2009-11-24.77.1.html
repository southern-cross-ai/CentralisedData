        Hear, hear! I endorse your comments entirely. It is with great pleasure that I inform the House about an exciting new venture in my electorate, which I had the privilege of officially opening last Saturday, 21 November. The Ulladulla Institute of Design is a brand new and unique facility that reflects innovation and incredible vision. Director Karl von Busse is a man of passion and flair who must be applauded for his initiative and also his confidence in the region. The building that will become home to around 50 design students next year is nothing short of stunning, featuring state-of-the-art technology and world-class design tools. The fashion industry is a very dynamic and exciting place and I can see many of our young people going on to unbelievable career paths made possible by this facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Karl von Busse some time ago, when he told me of his plans and I did not really believe it would all happen. I should never have doubted him. I remember being extremely impressed by his determination and positive views for both the area and his concept. He asked for assistance with government red tape and procedures, which we were able to do, to help get this fantastic visionary concept off the ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ulladulla is a place with endless potential, but few realise the opportunities. I am very conscious of the vibrant artistic community in the Milton-Ulladulla area, and the women present on Saturday night certainly reflected this, as did Peter, the flamboyant member of staff whom I intend to bring to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to liven the place up. The institute offers an exciting opportunity to a number of young people who want to pursue a career in fashion design and graphics, and I am sure that there will be plenty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ulladulla is one of the areas of Gilmore that unfortunately is plagued by high youth unemployment and social problems. It has been suggested that a lack of vocational opportunities for young people is one of the reasons for this. It often results in young people leaving the area in search of tertiary or employment options. The thought that this facility could offer new life and hope for the young people of the region and attract others with passion and ambition is a fantastic prospect. I trust it will also draw other industries to the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Karl previously owned and operated the highly successful KvB Institute of Technology in Sydney for 30 years and some of the people who worked with him at that time are now joining him in his new venture on our

        . You must have done something right, Karl. Karl is bringing all of his extensive expertise here and I am sure the entire community will join me in thanking him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Karl is already claimed as a local. In fact he was at one stage—he lived in Mollymook for about six years—and I know that the 180 people who attended Saturday’s opening will now appreciate why he was so keen to come back instead of retiring. He witnessed his spectacular dream come to life. I understand that Karl wants to develop this facility further, offering students more than the initial advanced diploma. The
        <i>

        suggested that the potential for overseas trips for students to pursue their studies is not beyond the realms of possibility. This is an incredible source of motivation and I would love to see people with the same confidence and motivation that Karl has initiate other ventures in this, an inspiring part of Australia. It is said that like attracts like, and, Karl, I hope you turn out to be a magnet. I want to take this opportunity to do two things. First of all, I would like to throw my wholehearted support behind his bid to see the school gain
