       <p>
        I rise today in the Main Committee to present a petition addressed to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives involving a critical proposal which could have long-term detrimental effects on a significant region within my electorate of Farrer. This petition, with Stephen Block as the principal petitioner, contains the signatures of no less than 6,388 citizens of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Broken Hill

        and the far west region of

         New South Wales
        </a>
        , asking honourable members to save the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to advise the House that the petition was considered at a recent meeting of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>

         Petition
        </a>
        s and certified as being in accordance with those standing orders. I note that the subject of the petition must be a matter on which the House has the power to act—that is, it must be a federal matter, involving, in this case, administration of government. I also note that, as part of those standing orders, the petition must actually include a request for action by the House. In this case, it is a pretty simple request and one that, as a house of democracy, we should all subscribe to, and that is: that we should undertake local consultation before this government moves to take any action that would drain and/or decommission Lake Menindee and Lake Cawndilla, in the so far undecided expectation that an aquifer will become a viable option in the future.

        The petition of residents in the Farrer/Murray-Darling Electorates draws to the attention of the House that they are opposed to the proposal to drain Lake Menindee and Cawndilla and decommission those lakes. The acquifer proposed by the Federal Government to supply Broken Hill with water is an unrealistic and costly alternative and has the potential to price water beyond the capacity of Broken Hill consumers.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">

        must also realise that the Menindee Lakes are a tourism asset and provide a recreational area for people in the far west and tourists.

        Your petitioners therefore request the House ensures local consultation is undertaken to gain local knowledge before any decision is made.

        Petition received.

       <p>
        I cannot stress enough to this parliament the strength of feeling that people in Broken Hill, Menindee and the far west region of New South Wales have about a government in Canberra putting a proposal that would alter, permanently, the environment, amenity, structure and everything associated with the magnificent Menindee Lakes—and at a distance, without the consultation that we would expect as residents of the area and that we deserve. Instead of relying on the Menindee Lakes for Broken Hill’s water, as has been the case for many years, it is proposed that a so far unverified aquifer should be the new source of Broken Hill’s water.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken about this in the House before; this is not a new proposition, to store water in an aquifer. It is certainly very risky to store drinking water in an aquifer, subject to contamination and salinity. Just think of the mechanics of moving the water from an aquifer so far away to provide fresh water for drinking for a city the size of Broken Hill, when already we have a perfectly good pipe—and, yes, it does need upgrading—that runs from the Menindee Lakes directly into Broken Hill’s water supply. People in the far west feel very angry about this, and that is why we have those 6,000-odd signatures on this petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        With its stunning wetlands, red sand dunes and array of native wildlife, the far west and the Menindee Lakes are a natural paradise. They support hundreds of thousands of waterbirds, including migratory shore birds, and there are over 200,000 waterbirds, including 34 species, and 40,000 small wading birds—more than are found in Kakadu. It is truly an amazing part of Australia. I will be spending the time between Christmas and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         New Year
        </a>
        on the road between Menindee and Wilcannia, quite near the lakes, because there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to appreciate the environment that we have there, and I would certainly support every single one of the signatories to this petition to make sure that no decisions are made about the future of the Menindee Lakes without very careful consultation and a recognition of the lakes’ real and genuine environmental amenity.
