        I rise today to acknowledge the efforts of three young people in my electorate of Jagajaga. Finlay, Victoria and Georgia are 12-year-old students at Saint Bernadette's primary school in Ivanhoe. After learning about the impact of Cyclone Winston in Fiji during February and March of this year, Finlay, an avid rugby fan, was inspired to help. The children decided to try and raise between $400 and $500 to purchase sport supplies to send to Fiji. But the community response was overwhelming. The children held cake stalls and fundraising games with prizes donated by local businesses and community members, and $1,600 was raised. They were able to buy 16 volleyballs, eight volleyball nets, 32 rugby balls, 16 netballs, 16 soccer balls, eight bags and eight pumps and needles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students at Saint Bernadette's wrote messages on the equipment before it was taken to Fiji and distributed by the president of Finlay's rugby club, the Harlequins. The equipment was gratefully received by the Fijians, who were taken aback at the kindness of strangers. Congratulations to Finlay, Victoria and Georgia, and thank you.
