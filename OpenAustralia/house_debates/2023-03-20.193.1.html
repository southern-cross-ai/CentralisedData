       <p>
        I was privileged enough to emigrate to Australia with my family in 2002. My family moved into a house in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Bull Creek
        </a>
        , just down the road from where my electoral office is now. My family and I were so happy to be in Australia, but it was a bit scary. Everything was new, and we had no-one we knew to show us how to navigate Australian life. That's where my dear friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Baker" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Baker
        </a>
        came in.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bruce lived in the house next to us in Bull Creek with his wife, Bridget. Bruce and Bridget were so kind to us. They welcomed us as though we were their own family members. Bruce taught me lots of things. He showed me how to clean the swimming pool and mow my lawn. My family even had our first Aussie barbecue in Bruce's house! The food was so simple to prepare, yet so good. I still prefer Bruce's cooked barbecue prawns. They're the best in the west. It has been a joy to remain friends with Bruce after all these years, and my kids still call him 'Uncle Bruce'. Thank you for taking care of us under your wing, Uncle Bruce, and thank you for helping make Australia feel like home. We will never forget your kindness.
