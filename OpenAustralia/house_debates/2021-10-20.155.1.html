        I rise today to pay attribute to Jack Hopgood
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM

        , who passed away this past weekend after over 101 years of inspirational life lived. Jack was a softly spoken, humble man, who was never comfortable being the focus of attention. But it would be remiss of me not to honour his life in this place at his time of passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jack Richard Hopgood was born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        in 1920. Jack enlisted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        at the age of 19. On 1 April 1940 he was deployed overseas at the age of 20, leaving behind his job at his father's garage and his new bride, Jean. He served in Sumatra and was captured by the Japanese in Java. He was taken to Singapore as a prisoner of war in 1942. He was held by the Japanese for more than three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon returning home from war in 1945, Jack returned to his father's garage, eventually taking over the business upon his father's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was an exceptional member of the Mount Gambier community and someone I was proud and extremely privileged to even know. Jack was involved in the Mount Gambier Aero Club and the Mount Gambier Veteran &amp; Vintage Car Club, was a founding member of the Mount Gambier chamber, of course, and also served as President of the Mount Gambier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . An avid golfer, Jack was instrumental in the establishment of the Blue Lake Golf Club, as well as being largely responsible for the beautification of the lakes area in Mount Gambier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Hopgood was awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in 2018 for his decades of service to the Mount Gambier community. Upon receiving this award, the ever-modest Mr Hopgood remarked: 'Well, when you've lived as long as me, you would hope that you've achieved something; otherwise, I suppose, you've spent a lot of time in bed.' While Jack was modest, many were in awe of not only what he endured but what he achieved, but, most importantly, his attitude to life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon returning to Japan in 2017 as a guest of the Japanese government, Jack remarked: 'I don't hold any resentment. Hate is a useless emotion.' Jack spent an unimaginable three years as a prisoner of war and returned to life in the Mount Gambier community without resentment, at a time when it was pretty trendy to hate. Instead, he gave back to his community of Mount Gambier, and it's a better place for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week, we mourn the loss of a great man, but we celebrate his life of difference that he made to so many. My condolences are extended to his children Peter, Duncan, Cathryn and their families. Vale, Jack Hopgood OAM.
