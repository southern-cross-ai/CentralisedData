       <p>
        We've have seen more reports this week about veteran suicides but, instead of a royal commission, the Morrison government has come up with a political fix, a national commissioner, which is just another in-house review of Defence and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        . The Morrison government, those opposite, refuse to heed the voices of veterans and their families when they say over and over that the system is broken.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the former Defence members of the Liberal Party are not standing up and pushing for a royal commission. Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Molan" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Molan
        </a>
        says nothing else can be done. The member for Canning,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hastie" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Hastie
        </a>
        , has got a leadership role to play here. He's a minister now. The member for Stirling, Vince Connelly, just spoke of youth suicide. Veteran suicide is a big issue and, from his experience in the military, he should see that the system is broken. In Tasmania, the member for Braddon, Gavin Pearce, has had suicides in his unit. You would think he'd be calling loudest of all. In Townsville, the member for Herbert, Phillip Thompson, actually did support a royal commission and he's now fallen back into line. Why aren't their voices ringing out in support of a royal commission?
       </p>
       <p>
        The system is broken. The system needs a systematic review, and it behoves those opposite, particularly those with military experience, to support our veterans.
