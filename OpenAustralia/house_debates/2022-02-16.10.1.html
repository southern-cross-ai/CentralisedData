       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The criminal misuse and trafficking of illegal firearms is a deadly crime and an ongoing threat to the safety of the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the 2019 election, the coalition government recommitted to the Australian people to implement tougher criminal penalties for gun related crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        These reforms fulfil that commitment. We are doing everything in our power to ensure the ongoing safety and security of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only are illegal firearms used regularly to threaten and commit acts of violence; they enable organised crime groups to protect their interests and be more lethal in their activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        One illegal firearm in our community is clearly one too many.
       </p>
       <p>
        The continued supply of firearms, combined with their durability and recirculation through the community after being trafficked, is a growing and serious threat to the safety of our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It only takes one illegal firearm in the hands of a person with malicious intent—whether it be criminal gangs or domestic violence perpetrators—to be of great concern to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill shows the government's intent towards traffickers and criminal networks. Gun related crime and violence will not be tolerated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will double the maximum penalty for existing firearms-trafficking offences from 10 to 20 years imprisonment under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        Act 1995.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those trafficking in large quantities of firearms and firearms parts, the bill introduces aggravated offences to the Criminal Code. These serious crimes would carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also ensure that offenders cannot use loopholes, such as breaking up trafficking shipments and operations into smaller numbers, to avoid aggravated offences and the resulting higher penalties.
       </p>
       <p>
        As promised at the last election, the bill will also impose a mandatory minimum sentence on these offences of at least five years imprisonment, a further reflection on the serious nature of this crime. This will be accompanied by appropriate judicial discretion for cooperation with law enforcement and guilty pleas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The combined effect of these increased penalties and aggravated offences will be to provide a strong deterrent against traffickers, their facilitators and backers in organised crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        Illegal firearms put us all at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any efforts to reduce the number of illegal firearms in the community is a positive step forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill appropriately reflects the community's expectations, the serious consequences of gun related crime and the gravity of the offences.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures are a further demonstration of the Morrison government's commitment to keep our communities safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
