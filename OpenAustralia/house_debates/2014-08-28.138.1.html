        A few weeks ago I had the great honour of being given the opportunity by Goodstart Early Learning to spend a day walking in the shoes of the educators of the Golden Square Early Education Centre. On the day, I spent time talking to parents who have their children at the centre. I also spent time talking to the educators who work there and to their director, Emily. I was impressed and I admired the commitment and dedication of the educators. They go above and beyond to ensure that all the children in the centre have a quality learning and care environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The professionalism of the educators is what struck me most, and the passion that the educators have can only be described as inspirational. When I talk about their professionalism I talk about their commitment to ensure that every experience that the children have is linked to a learning outcome. The staff explained to me that some of the children in the centre come from disadvantaged backgrounds and quite often the educators take a leading role in these young people's lives to ensure that they develop the numeracy and literacy skills that they need. Some of them are also actively involved in the basics, like toilet training and ensuring that the children receive the nutritious meals that they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the babies room to the kindergarten, each hour of the day I was in another room. In the babies room I learned the importance of ratios. Currently the ratios in Victorian centres are one to fourâ€”one educator to four babies. Previously it had been one to five. The educators talked about how they could not return to that system. They worried that if they did they would not be able to provide the care that the babies need. In the babies room they have babies of all different ages, from six months to 18 months and they all have different sleeping patterns and requirements. So to move again to a ratio of one to five would be hard.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my visit I learned firsthand how important it is to give all children, regardless of background, the opportunity to engage in early learning. In the kindergarten room they were working on their letter of the day, which was 'P'. Before lunch each of the children had to name a 'P' word. Luckily we were having pumpkin soup, so quite a few of them mentioned the word 'pumpkin'. It was another way in which they were integrating learning into the basics of early childhood education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the conversation nationally on child care, it was a great time to be in an early childhood centre in my local electorate talking to staff about how all governments can support the work that they do. They have concerns, which I share, about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's draft report on the area. The report raises more questions than answers. At first glance, it could be suggesting that parents and individual educators may become responsible for ensuring compliance with the heavily regulated sector and complex employment conditions. The commission's report had wide-ranging recommendations which, if implemented, could have a profound impact on the quality of education for our youngest Australians. I welcome the recommendation that the National Quality Framework needs to be continued and that there needs to be an increased level of funding for the sector. However, several key recommendations could undermine this very recommendation and undermine the National Quality Framework. These include removing the requirement for degree-qualified educators for under-threes. It also includes a recommendation to remove the requirement for diplomas. In Bendigo, the La Trobe University's Bendigo campus that has moved into this space. What does it mean for the future of those students?
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage everyone in this place to spend a day walking in the shoes of educators and learning from them before making decisions about what to do next with the Productivity Commission. Learn from those in the sector.
