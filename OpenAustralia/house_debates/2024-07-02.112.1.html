        peoples. In light of

         NAIDOC Week
        </a>
        , I want to acknowledge the history and achievements of Ian Hamm, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorta_Yorta" rel="nofollow">
         Yorta Yorta
        </a>
        man and constituent in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian chaired Victoria's Stolen Generations Reparations Steering Committee, which provided advice and recommendations on the design of Victoria's stolen generations reparations. Ian has made a huge contribution to community and not-for-profit groups and devotes significant time to improving Aboriginal people's representation on boards and in governance roles. He has worked in senior roles in the Commonwealth government and the Victorian government and has been chair and board member of a number of major not-for-profit organisations. Ian has been prominent in promoting the economic empowerment of Indigenous people, including through Indigenous owned and managed businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian was taken from his birth mother when he was just three weeks old. Ian didn't find out about his origins until he was an adult but made up for lost time after connecting with his four siblings, cousins and extended family in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, he never got to meet his mother, who died in the same year he was taken from her. His aunt said that they were always struck by how similar he was in character to his mother.
       </p>
       <p>
        The theme of this year's NAIDOC Week is 'Keep the

        ! Blak, Loud and Proud'. It honours the enduring strength and vitality of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        culture, with fire as a symbol of connection to country and to each other. Ian Hamm embodies that strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a large and vibrant Nepalese community in my electorate and right across the broader Melbourne north-west. Canberra is also home to a strong Nepalese community. Last week, I met with leaders from Melbourne's and Canberra's Nepalese communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . The Nepalese community is the second-fastest-growing migrant community in Australia. There are many Nepalese students in Australia studying at universities and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        providers. Indeed, they are the third-largest student body in Australia. Nepalis also make a huge contribution to the aged-care and hospitality sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently met Bom Yonzon, the leader of the Nepalese community in my electorate and President of the Federation of Nepalese Community Associations in Australia. The federation recently marked International
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everest_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Everest Day
        </a>
        by talking about the significance of the mountain to Nepalese culture and to the Nepalese economyâ€”for example, through tourism. Everest Day is also a time to consider the threat to the Himalayas from global warming and climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         The Federation
        </a>
        of Nepalese Community Associations in Australia is undertaking important work in raising awareness of the problems and issues faced by new immigrants, students and temporary workers, including by providing settlement services and support for mental health, family violence, financial hardship, workplace discrimination and dealing with a lack of representation in elected bodies. They also do so much for the young people in the community, including through holding major sporting festivals in Melbourne and right around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to bring attention to the very important work done by the East African Women's Foundation, not only in my electorate but, again, right across Melbourne's west and north. This group helps women in vulnerable situations to deal with social isolation, family violence and financial vulnerability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The East African Women's Foundation is a key partner of the Western Bulldogs Community Foundation and, through this, has helped numerous women participate in the Daughters of the West program. This is a fantastic program that helps women with their health, their social connectedness and their overall wellbeing. I felt very privileged to attend a graduation ceremony of women from the African communities in my electorate who had graduated from the Western Bulldogs Daughters of the West program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The East African Women's Foundation is also a leader in dealing with complex social issues. I recently met with the foundation to discuss their concerns in relation to the practice of female genital mutilation. The foundation says that too little is being done to stop the practice and that many women in the Somali community in particular report that there is little information available to help them, or legal advice to help them, protect their children. The foundation is seeking to establish a network to advise and inform affected communities, health professionals and social workers, and also to provide support for victims of female genital mutilation. I look forward to partnering with the foundation on all its important work.
