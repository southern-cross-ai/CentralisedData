       <p>
        I wish to speak about the recent announcement of the federal government’s sale of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        land at Long Pocket. This comes as a massive blow to the residents and community groups in Ryan who have been lobbying against this sale for a number of years. The prime 7.2 hectare riverside site is in a unique location and offered an excellent opportunity to conserve green space for future generations. Instead it has been sold in yet another Labor fire sale to balance its books. The Gillard government stands condemned for its lack of vision.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor candidate in Ryan constantly campaigned on his so-called green credentials. It is therefore not surprising that the government waited until after the election to make this announcement. This highlights Labor’s hypocrisy on the environment—all talk and no action. No wonder the Greens outpolled Labor so convincingly in the

        ward by-election last Saturday. The land has been sold to a developer who intends to build over 100 houses on the site. As well as destroying an important nature corridor, such a development will have a major impact on local roads already congested after years of poor infrastructure planning by state Labor governments. Only two roads access this site and, with the presence of four large schools and the

        within the immediate vicinity, the area is already one of Brisbane’s largest generators of traffic, without adding more pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government knows that a recent high-density development application on neighbouring land was rejected due to overwhelming community concerns. Labor would do well to learn that, contrary to their belief that Canberra knows best, many local issues are better understood by locals. The sale of this land demonstrates the Gillard government’s contempt for the views of the local communities, absence of any green values and a total lack of vision.
