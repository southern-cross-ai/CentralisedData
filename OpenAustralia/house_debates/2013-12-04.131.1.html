        In October this year residents of the

        in

        </a>
        were hit by some of the most savage bushfires in recent history, certainly the most savage since the Victorian calamity. Nearly 200 homes were completely destroyed, with another 95 damaged. At one point there were 60 fires burning simultaneously, with 22 of them out of control. It is often during difficult times like this that heroes shine and the spirit of generosity of Australians also comes through. I am proud to say that my local community was one of the most active in joining forces to provide significant assistance to those affected by the bushfires.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, the local Chinese and Vietnamese communities in my electorate raised more than a quarter of a million dollars during the few short weeks that followed the fires. My electorate, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, is the most multicultural electorate in the country, with more than half the people in Fowler born overseas. But despite the socioeconomic challenges within my area, it is also home to some of the most generous people in the country. I was present at a large fundraising dinner organised by over 30 of the Chinese associations of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , which raised $110,000 on the night. The funds were presented to Councillor Romola Hollywood, representing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains City Council
        </a>
        , and have gone towards the Mayoral Relief Fund. This single large fundraising dinner was coordinated by one of the most active members of the local community I have ever seen, who is also the chairman of the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society: Mr James Chan. Among the many guests was the representative of the Consul-General of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of China in Sydney, Consul Wang Yun.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, around about the same time, the local Vietnamese community came together in an absolutely dedicated effort that raised over $160,000. This significant sum was raised over a period of three weeks through special appeals on the streets of Cabramatta,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canley_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Canley Heights
        </a>
        and Bankstown, and through email appeals and a fundraising dinner. Almost a third of the funds were raised by young volunteers on the streets of my electorate at a time of what was probably Sydney's most inclement weather. The effort was first initiated by Vietnamese Community Australia President Mr Thanh Nguyen, with five other prominent Vietnamese organisations joining in. These include the Australian Vietnamese Health Professions Association, led by Dr Hien Tran; the Vietnam Vision Project, Dr Phuoc Vo; the Hope Project, under the leadership of Mr Chinh Dang;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , with

        </a>
        ; and the Vietnamese Scouts, led by Thuy Dinh. The funds raised were donated to the St Vincent de Paul bushfire appeal. A representative from St Vincent de Paul, when receiving the donation, said they were truly moved and had not experienced this kind of generosity from a small community such as the Vietnamese Australians previously.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate I represent is in no way wealthy, with many of the residents struggling. But this has never stopped them from being generous and thinking of others, particularly in difficult times. This is not the first time that residents in my electorate came to the fore when trying to look after fellow Australians. It was particularly notable when I first met them during the course of the Queensland floods. It was during that time that I learnt of an old Vietnamese saying, which translates as: when you eat the fruit of the tree, you have regard for the people who planted the seed. And for the Vietnamese, this was their way of saying that when they came to Australia they took on a community responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of the Vietnamese and Chinese communities—and the many other communities who have migrated to this country over the last few decades—have often expressed to me their sense of gratitude to Australia for welcoming them with open arms and giving them a second chance at a brighter future. Monetary assistance is just one way my community was able to help fellow Aussies throughout the bushfires in October. This is something that I think should reflect on modern Australia itself, and I am very grateful for the goodwill that serves and motivates this community.
