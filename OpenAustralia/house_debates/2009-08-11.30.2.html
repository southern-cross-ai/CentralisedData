       <p>
        Mr Speaker, on indulgence: it is with great sadness that we mark today the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wexler" rel="nofollow">
         Anne Wexler
        </a>
        , a true friend of Australia. There are few people who have played such a critical role in developing ties between Australia and the United States. Anne was responsible for many successes in this vital relationship, but her role in the establishment of the American-Australian Free Trade Agreement Coalition and in the American Australian Leadership Dialogue are particularly noteworthy and worthy of the attention of the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition was the central vehicle for promoting the bilateral free trade agreement between Australia and the United States. Anne mobilised her network of contacts across the breadth of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        political and business spectrum to deliver wholehearted support for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        when it came up for consideration by the United States congress. The coalition grew to well over 200 members and undertook a systematic advocacy campaign in congress that helped persuade both the house and the senate to pass the final free trade legislation with handsome majorities. The free trade agreement in place today stands as a testament to her work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anne also played a decisive role in establishing the American Australian Leadership Dialogue. As a forum that creates and builds contacts between so many influential Australians and Americans, the dialogue is an essential element of the bilateral relationship. It would not have been capable of achieving this success were it not for Anne’s enthusiastic personal commitment and work. The dialogue has its 17th meeting this week in Melbourne and I know many members of this place will be attending. Anne had wanted to attend that meeting and we will all miss her involvement this year as we honour the role that she played in making the dialogue possible in the first place. Beyond these formal achievements, Anne played a key role in introducing many leading Australians to Washington, its people and its corridors of influence. For example, my own understanding of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_and_Americans" rel="nofollow">
         America and Americans
        </a>
        is richer because of her support, and Therese and I will miss her guidance and support greatly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anne’s personal energy, her drive, her sophisticated understanding of how to make things happen, as well as her wit, humour and toughness when it was needed, were evident to all who worked with her. She is being remembered in the United States for her contribution to several generations of American politics and for the remarkable example that she set as a successful, progressive, powerful female figure in Washington in occupations largely dominated by men. Anne Wexler was awarded an honorary appointment within the Order of Australia in 2002 for her outstanding service to Australian-American relations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We pass on our sincere condolences to Anne’s husband,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Duffey" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Duffey
        </a>
        , and to all of her family. We trust that as they grieve they will take a measure of comfort from the many friends that she and they have made in Australia and from the significance of her work for all of us. Anne took every opportunity to generate goodwill between Australia and the United States. Today we honour her contribution to strengthening the official and the personal relationship between Australians and Americans and her role in keeping our alliance strong.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I associate the opposition with the Prime Minister’s remarks about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wexler" rel="nofollow">
          Anne Wexler
         </a>
         . In a lifetime of achievement Anne did so much to advance the Australia-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         Free Trade Agreement, the American Australian Leadership Dialogue and the relations between our two great countries. The leadership dialogue will, as the Prime Minister noted, convene again this weekend in Melbourne, sadly without Anne. She was a dynamic Washingtonian, as only Washington,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC" rel="nofollow">

         can produce. She was an honorary officer in the Order of Australia, a very rare honour for a foreign citizen. Most importantly, she was a great friend of our nation and a friend whose passing will be deeply regretted on both sides of the Pacific.
