        CHALMERS () (): My question is to the Prime Minister. Jeta Gardens, to the south of Brisbane, is the site of the worst aged-care COVID outbreak in the state, with 100 residents and 82 staff infected. According to reports, a resident was taken to hospital after falling from a second-floor balcony on 2 February when she did not receive her pain medication. An incident report lists neglect as a factor in her fall. Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for the shocking crisis in his aged-care system?

         In relation to this case: this has been referred to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. I won't pre-empt the findings, but that is already being undertaken.

         In relation to Jeta Gardens: we recognise that there has been—

          <p>
           We recognise that there has been a significant outbreak, and the actions taken by the department of health and government include a department of health case manager put in place; a Metro South Health unit nurse navigator allocated and an Aspen clinical first responder; the Older Persons Advocacy Network engaged; the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission engaged; a surge workforce from Aspen, with one lead and four resident nurses, two personal care workers plus one Healthcare Australia worker; Community Business Australia has been engaged; and we've had additional security put in place. In particular, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has mandated a nurse adviser support for training, and Sonic Pathology Australia has been in place periodically since 7 January. As early as 7 January a notice to agree was put in place by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner. In addition to that we have 15,120 P2 or N95 respirators which have been provided; 7,600 gowns; 36,000 gloves; 3,000 protective goggles; and 5,580 rapid antigen tests. All of these have been put in place as part of the process to ensure that there is a rapid response.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of the individual: I would be very happy to provide the details to the House once the quality and safety commissioner has completed her investigation. I know, in particular, that the commissioner has taken this and other cases around the country very seriously. There have been over 19,000 site visits or reviews by the commissioner over the course of the last two years. This has been one of the important actions which has been put in place. Indeed, the commission was established by this government, in addition to the royal commission, as a permanent, standing aged-care quality and safety commission. It's funded and has expanded under this government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister. This is something which we regard as a critical and fundamental role.
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, I want to thank all of the nurses and the personal care workers, and all those who have helped Australia to have one of the lowest rates of loss of life in aged care. I think that is a very important thing to understand, that, as we face real challenges, what our nurses and our personal care workers—those who are involved in aged care—have achieved is to save lives on a scale which compares—
