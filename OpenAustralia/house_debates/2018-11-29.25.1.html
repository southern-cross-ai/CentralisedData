        Today I want to pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        , which advances the rights of women, families and communities through advocacy and empowerment, especially for those living in regional, rural and remote Australia. Having said that, I'm honoured to have more than one branch in my electorate of Ryan. Indeed, the Moggill group is one of the largest in Australia. I'm sure that many of you know the iconic Country Women's Association cookbook, a household staple. It's just a piece of the puzzle, and today I take time to recognise the many hardworking volunteers behind the success of the Country Women's Association.

        prides itself on diversity, empowerment and friendship, and the Moggill branch is well known for its variety of activities. They're not just the ones you'd expect, like cooking and fundraisers. Moggill also do birthing kits for poorer nations in the Pacific and they reach out on an international basis. They also have some very talented art-and-craft workshops as well as a fabulous choir. Recently, they had their annual Christmas stall at the local Kenmore Plaza. The stall raised community spirits, with members selling quilts, kitchen items and Christmas decorations. Importantly, the funds were all directed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">

        's rural crisis fund, which helps families and communities struggling through the drought. I take my hat off to those wonderful volunteers at the CWA.
