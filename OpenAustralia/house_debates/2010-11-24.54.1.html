        As the new federal member for Ryan, I was pleased to recently launch the annual Ryan Christmas card competition. Students from prep to year 3 from schools throughout the electorate participated in the competition, this year with the theme ‘What Christmas means to me’. I am very grateful to the principals, staff, parents and students of our many local primary schools for their support of this initiative and their assistance. I was delighted and impressed with the level of participation and high standard of talent. Together with the community, I look forward to showcasing the artwork of our primary students throughout the electorate on my Christmas cards. I also look forward to making this competition an annual event. My special appreciation and thanks to the judges—Barry Searle of the

        , Philippa Wightman of the

        and

        I again congratulate the winners of the competition and also take this opportunity to wish all the staff, parents and students of our local schools a very happy and safe Christmas and
