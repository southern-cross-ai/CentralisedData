        That the resolution relating to the time and order of business for Tuesday, 26 June 2012 agreed to earlier today, be amended by omitting 12 noon wherever it appears and substituting 9 am.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is intended for the information of members that at 9 am tomorrow we will have a vote on the motion moved by the member for Bradfield, which relates to the anniversary of the terrorist act that occurred at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Munich Olympics
        </a>
        . It is important that vote takes place prior to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Games
        </a>
        being held in London. The motion was a request made by the Manager of Opposition Business, which the government was happy to support. Therefore, that vote will take place first and then we will have debate on other bills, on which there are long speaking lists, in order to facilitate the timely exit we hope to achieve in accordance with the schedule that has been set down for later this week. I thank the House.

         The opposition is grateful that the Leader of the House has agreed to ensure that the motion on the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich 40 years ago is voted on before the Olympics actually begin. It has bipartisan support. I understand that the member for Isaacs and the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Ports" rel="nofollow">
          Melbourne Ports
         </a>
         as well as coalition MPs will speak on this motion to support it. The Leader of the House and I and many other MPs have jointly signed advertising to support this particular motion because this kind of issue should be well above partisan politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also agreed between us that we sit from 9 am to 2 pm tomorrow in unusual circumstances given it is the last week of this session and sometimes it can spill over to the last day. We are all working and we hope the Senate will also see, within their infinite wisdom, the benefits of finishing on Thursday rather than sitting on Friday.
