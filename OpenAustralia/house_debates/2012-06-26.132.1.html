        That is a very interesting claim, considering the member who represents those opposite wants to increase company tax—that is part of their mantra—and wanted to block our company tax cuts. After that anomalous thought, I would actually like to celebrate some wonderful things that are going on out in the Australian community. You would never know it from the contributions of those opposite, but the fact is that there are great thing going on, and there will be great things going on after 1 July as well.

        One of the wonderful things that I recently attended was the 80th anniversary of the

        Country Women's Association. I want to pay tribute to all the people who were there celebrating alongside the ladies, but I will mention some particular names. Noela Bell, the president of the branch, hosted us. Diana Frost, the Northumberland group president, and treasurer Robyn Smith were in attendance. Cass Wailes, the secretary, and Heather Wootton were great organisers and were the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        in the Woy Woy region, and we left the afternoon very enlightened. Member Zeta Connor was sick that day and unable to attend. Maud Crittenden attended. Maris Hartley, who gave her apologies, does wonderful cultural work for the CWA. Also in attendance were Edith Hyslop, Amy Peck and Colleen Smith.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Francis" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        We had a truly wonderful afternoon at the CWA. I am very pleased to say that all the beautiful crockery on display was not provided by the ladies and was not washed up by the ladies and that the food served was not made by the ladies. They were treated and looked after on their birthday celebration.

        Meanwhile, the

        Surf Life Saving Club were preparing for the celebration of their 90th anniversary as one of the most prestigious surf-lifesaving clubs on the coast. Last year Katie Dixon was the state and Australian Surf Life Saver of the Year, and she was acknowledged at her home of Ocean Beach. Dave Unger was another recipient, of Australian Surf Sports Official of the Year. Some of the stats from the Ocean Beach club this year include: 72,000 visitors, 5,200 hours on patrol, 907 preventive actions, 10 rescues, 90 first-aid assistance actions and—the most important statistic of all—zero lives lost.

        I want to mention some awardees.

The members who put in the most hours during the year were as follows: Nigel Fitzgibbon, who led from the front as the director of patrol, put in 122½ hours;

        The organisers of this great celebration had us wear the club colours, maroon and blue. I congratulate Lyn Smith,

I follow that up with the regional awards for the surf lifesaving fraternity on the coast. They clocked up 895 lives saved and there were 8,559 preventative actions over the last season.
