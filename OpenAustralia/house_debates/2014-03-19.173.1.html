       <p>
        I rise to speak on this condolence motion with great heart and some enthusiasm to say of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Parer" rel="nofollow">
         Warwick Parer
        </a>
        that, as the Minister for Resources and Energy of our country, the job he did in a short period of time was simply terrific. Warwick Parer was well regarded in Western Australia's resources sector for many reasons: he understood it instinctively, he understood it legislatively and he cared. In the context of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        sector, in which I was employed from the early 2000s before my entry to parliament, Minister Parer performed a number of regulatory simplifying operations that made life significantly easier for that sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members will be aware that the idea of exporting Australia's mineral resources seems to us today to be a relatively straightforward matter, but one of the substantial regulatory burdens on the sector at the turn of the century, in 1999, was that any shipment of LNG from Australia had to be given the approval of the minister for resources. Every single shipment had to obtain that approval—and Minister Parer removed that regulatory burden and obstacle, which allowed the industry to both feel more comfortable about its operations and also perform its operations in a much smoother way. It may seem an odd thing to remark upon, but it takes a minister who cares and understands about the little things to have a big impact, and Senator Parer's impact across the board in resources was not simply the accumulation of those small pieces of caring knowledge; it was a big impact because it was very clear to those in the resources sector that he enjoyed being amongst them. He enjoyed visiting mine sites. He enjoyed visiting the big stuff and he pressed boards, executives and employees of companies on matters from safety and efficiency through to ensuring that these industries had a robust growth path.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was an executive from Utah's coalmining division. In his latter years he continued as chairman of a power corporation. He continued to serve his community of Queensland in many different ways until his death last week. Mr Parer is in many ways a great exemplar both of public service and of good corporate practice—public service in a man who cared to serve his party as well as he possibly could, to serve his state in the best way possible and to find those value-adding, no-cost initiatives that were so reforming for the resources sector and from which Australia continues to benefit. He did all of this in a relatively short time as minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to him for his hard work and his thoughtful efforts, and I express my condolences to his family and his friends and my regret that I will not be able to attend his funeral on Friday. But I am in some hope that my comments today show both respect and admiration for a man who came to Canberra and made a substantial mark that is remembered, acknowledged and understood by those of us in the industry who benefited from his time, his service, his thoughtfulness and his insight.

        <p>
         I thank the member for Brand for his comments. I might say I had the privilege of seeing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Parer" rel="nofollow">
          Warwick Parer
         </a>
         's widow, Kathi, last Tuesday week at a function in Brisbane. While I think he was unwell, I was not apprised of any particular immediate vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had the great privilege of serving with Warwick Parer in this parliament. He joined it on 5 November 1984, succeeding a dear friend of mine,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
          Kathy Sullivan
         </a>
         , who became the member for Moncrieff. I served with him while he was a minister in the Howard government. We served together from 11 March 1996 until 21 October 1998, and he remained in the parliament until he left in February 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was a person whom I greatly admired. I had the opportunity of understanding something of the career he had with Utah before he came here. I must say I think it is very hard, from personal experience—not related to me but to my late father—for people in business to be able to aspire to public service. I do not think that in Australia firms understand that in the way in which they do, for instance, in the United States of America. I know from personal experience that some people have even had employment discontinued when they have evinced a willingness to give of themselves in public life. So it is unusual to have somebody who had succeeded at a very high level in commerce coming into the parliament to serve as he did for some 16 years and then, as he left, going back—as my colleague said a few moments ago—to serve in business but also to serve his party.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland between 2005 and 2008. Others may speak of that engagement, because I understand that he was particularly positive in seeking the formation of the coalition of Liberals and Nationals that we now have in Queensland. He was a person who continued that involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am glad that the member for Brand remains here, because I wanted to read to him a little of Warwick's maiden speech, because it was somewhat prescient. I do not know whether the member will mind me involving him in the politics of today. Warwick had this to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under the Constitution there are clearly defined powers of the Federal government. Yet over the years, by various devices, Federal governments have slowly usurped powers that are better left to the States. State governments are not let off; they have done the same to local government. Yet the bureaucratic baggage of regulation remains at all levels—
        </p>
        <p>
         somewhat prescient, isn't it—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Much to the bewilderment of the person in the street. People are confused and frustrated at the cost and the complexity of the plethora of State and Federal laws. Obvious examples of duplication occur in the areas of housing, health, roads, education and the environment. The elimination of duplication would not only put us on the road to real reductions in taxation but it also makes political sense to have clearly defined separation of powers. This is the essence of a properly functioning, dynamic Federal system where competition and diversity, rather than levelling uniformity, are the hallmarks. Over the years it has been all too easy for the States to sheet home the blame for various problems on the Commonwealth or vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
         He went on to say—and this is particularly interesting:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The mining industry is exhausted by government regulations and punitive charges. The extent of the exhaustion can be seen in the dramatic decline in profitability, employment and investment—this in an industry which has the potential to contribute so much more to the prosperity of our great nation. Federal and State governments are equally to blame for the intolerable level of crippling taxes, charges and costly regulations. Governments avoid their responsibilities if they think the real problems will go away simply by the formation of committees and sub-committees.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is fascinating, isn't it? I should have given this quote to the Prime Minister for his speech earlier today. I am delighted that the member for Brand recognised that Warwick not only believed it but also put it into practice when he became the minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         Warwick is a man who has contributed greatly to this country. To his widow, Kathi, to his seven children and to his many grandchildren, I extend my personal condolences and I join with them as they grieve. He has been a great Australian, properly recognised, and his death has come a little too soon.

          I would also like to associate myself with the kind remarks by the member for Brand and the member for Berowra. I rise with great sadness to honour the passing of a man I consider to be a great Australian, the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Parer" rel="nofollow">
           Warwick Parer
          </a>
          AM.
         </p>
         <p>
          When I first came into this place as the member for Petrie in 1996, I was a very green member of parliament. I had worked in the business sector and did not know much about the political workings of the House. Warwick Parer took me under his wing. He was under no obligation at that time to extend his kindness and generosity to me, but that is exactly what he did, and I will be forever grateful for the benefits of his tutelage, his patience, his experience and, of course, his great congeniality. He was always a happy person. My experiences of him in this regard are not unique. We have heard in the other place Senators Boswell and Brandis this week acknowledging Warwick's open-door policy. He had a willingness to talk to anybody at any time about anything, and to provide advice. For that many of us in both houses were truly grateful. He was my mentor. I developed under his guidance, and he became my friend.
         </p>
         <p>
          Too often in this place, and in other areas of life, the use of superlatives in describing someone as a statesman is often overused to such an extent that the true import or gravity of such a description is sometimes watered down or loses its true meaning, but that was not the case with Warwick Parer. When I say we have lost a statesman with the passing of Warwick Parer, I do so knowing that that description will stand scrutiny and it is a deserved description of a great man.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was also a statesman of the Liberal Party. The member for Berowra spoke about his active work in the Liberal Party. Both he and Kathi were tireless workers for the party. For many years he was the patron of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
           Young Liberals
          </a>
          movement, and he and Kathi worked in a very dedicated and committed way for the Creek Road branch of the Liberal Party. He served as a Liberal senator for Queensland from 1984 to 2000, and was the Minister for Resources and Energy from 1996 to 1998 under Prime Minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           John Howard
          </a>
          . The member for Brand spoke about his very short time as resource minister, and one cannot underestimate what he achieved. In that time, he oversaw the abolition of the three mines uranium policy. The member for Brand is quite right: he oversaw the removing of regulation that absolutely strangled our resource sector at the time and had an incredible impost on export controls. By doing this, he improved expansion of our sector internationally. He also freed up jobs growth in that really important area.
         </p>
         <p>
          After leaving politics, Warwick was very active in the Liberal Party. He served as Queensland state president from 2005 to 2008. That was a very tumultuous time. He worked with the National Party president Bruce McIver to prepare for the eventual amalgamation of the two parties into the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
           LNP
          </a>
          . I had a large number of dealings with him after I lost my seat of Petrie in 2007. He was very helpful to me at that time.
         </p>
         <p>
          He served his state of Queensland and the country proudly and with great dignity. His dedication to public life has been acknowledged by many from both sides of the House, as well as captains of business and industry, and particularly by a lot of people who worked in the mining and resource sector in which he dedicated a whole lot of his working life. He was able to bring that great expertise into parliament and it assisted him to fulfil his parliamentary duties. Warwick served Australia in a number of important roles in his twin careers as a businessman and as a politician and, as has been stated by many members, he brought a depth of understanding to that resources portfolio that nobody—and I mean absolutely nobody—in the parliament could match.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was also a very interesting Minister for Resources and Energy. I recall that he would regularly say to me that the fisheries part of that portfolio took up 90 per cent of his time, because it was so contentious. I worked with him to remove an impost on the industry, which was the Australian prawn promotion levy. That freed up a lot of the impost, particularly on companies who were working in the prawn industry. The agency that was collecting the levy was very upset with the minister. It wanted the agency to continue, but the industry were so much in favour of it being abolished. I remember the agency taking out a full-page ad against the minister and myself. I was a bit disturbed at the time, and I remember Senator Parer telling me that it was the best advertising that I would ever get in my parliamentary career and that I should be very pleased that it was in the newspaper. I will never forget those words of encouragement, and he was absolutely right. It was a huge impost. The industry wanted it abolished and they were forever grateful that he took the step that he did.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was an exemplary fishing minister who worked closely with industry to deliver better outcomes for the sector and to reduce costs. It was a great privilege to work with him when he was fisheries minister. He was also very mindful of environmental sustainability. I thank him for the work that he did, particularly on the Patagonian toothfish, the fisheries and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Macquarie Island
          </a>
          . He realised the importance that commercial fishery had to play as well as making sure that there was environmental sustainability. In a press release at the time, when he was minister, he said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The arrangements will ensure that Australia obtains the maximum return from the fish resources in these waters, while guaranteeing that any long term fishery established in the area is sustainable.
         </p>
         <p>
          He worked constantly towards making sure that areas such as Macquarie Island were nominated for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
           World Heritage
          </a>
          listing and that fisheries were in tune with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unlike many in this place—and I have had the experience of leaving not of my own choosing—he left parliament of his own choosing. He left the Senate in 2000, at a time that he decided it was best for him. In a testament to his talents and his expertise, the business sector was all too willing to snap him up. He served as the chairman of the energy and transport advisory sector of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
           CSIRO
          </a>
          from 2002 to 2004. He was appointed a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Member of the Order of Australia
          </a>
          in 2005 for his work in the mining industry. In May 2012 Warwick took up the role of chairman of the board of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanwell_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
           Stanwell Corporation
          </a>
          Ltd. His dedication to community service continued in his post-political life. He was appointed chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation in 2010. I applaud him for fine work that he did as chair of that organisation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our sympathies go to Warwick's family, whose loss exceeds ours. His passing is a great loss to our nation and to public life. Warwick was a devoted husband to Kathi, a loving father to his seven children, Carol, Martine, Helen, Sonia, Warwick, Justin and Rowan. Warwick was also a very proud and devoted grandfather. To the Parer family: thank you, so much, for sharing your husband, father and grandfather with us. We are all the richer for his presence in our life.

           Sullivan, who in 1984 stood for the seat of Moncrieff, thereby creating the Senate vacancy that Senator Parer subsequently filled in 1985. I also note that upon his retirement in February 2000 his vacancy was filled by a good friend of mine, the current Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis.

           Warwick Parer, especially but not solely in his capacity as President of the Liberal Party, throughout the time of his very active involvement with and stewardship of the Liberal Party, was a person with whom I had the opportunity on many occasions to break bread and to discuss issues of the day, particularly, of course, political issues of the day. Warwick had a most magnificent holiday residence on the Gold Coast, in my electorate. It was a small place, the name of which escapes me but which I know is French, at Budds Beach, which is a favourite haunt of my wife, our family and mine. We would frequently find ourselves down there at a small cafe named Bumbles Cafe, at Budds Beach, and see Warwick tottering across the road to get his morning coffee, which he was partial to, whenever he and Kathi were staying on the Gold Coast. There were many occasions on which, by sheer coincidence, an opportunity arose for Warwick and me to discuss all manner of political issues and contemporary issues of the day at Bumbles Cafe.
          </p>
          <p>
           In many respects that for me is the focal point of my relationship with Warwick Parer, because although in a formal sense there was our relationship through the Liberal Party, it was his mentoring to a certain extent through those conversations—and there were many—at Budds Beach, on the Gold Coast, that helped to shape my view of the man and helped to deepen my understanding of him.
          </p>
          <p>
           He was in my estimation an erstwhile gentleman and a man of tremendous character and good humour. But he was a man who had a clear-eyed resolve when it came to what was needed for the Queensland Liberal Party. In many respects, Warwick Parer put in play and helped to facilitate the Liberal Party merger with the National Party, which created the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
            LNP
           </a>
           . That in many respects helped to land a victory, through what was a period of much tumult around what was going to happen the contemporary Queensland Liberal Party. It helped to land the very significant win that was achieved by the LNP at the state election.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have a very good relationship with one of Warwick's seven children, Justin Parer. He was a contemporary of mine in the Queensland
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
            Young Liberals
           </a>
           . He is a man who has gone on to leave an impression in business in Queensland, as did his father.
          </p>
          <p>
           Warwick Parer's contribution to the Gold Coast cannot be understated. He was a man who, through his time as a senator for Queensland, played an incredibly important role. I think he was born in Papua
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
            New Guinea
           </a>
           . He attended

            Nudgee College
           </a>
           . Those are great foundations. Some would worry about someone born in

            Papua New Guinea
           </a>
           , but he is certainly someone who excelled throughout the time of his involvement in the Senate and in the Liberal Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to acknowledge and honour Warwick Parer. He will remain a great man. Through his family, he has left his imprint not only on Queensland but also on Queensland politics. On a very personal level, to Kathi and his children I thank you for lending us Warwick Parer. Anyone who is involved in politics and has children, let alone seven children, recognises the incredible sacrifice made by family. For Warwick Parer to have achieved what he did, rising as a cabinet minister for resources and energy in the Howard government, and who was a senator from 1985 through until 2000, it really is in many respects the family that does the heavy lifting, with the frequent absences. As a father of two children I can only imagine the heavy lifting that Kathi had to do as a mother of seven children. To Kathi and the rest of Warwick's family, thank you for lending us Warwick Parer. His contribution was significant. He helped to shape me into the politician that I am today and he helped to shape generations of Young Liberals who mixed with Justin and also those who knew Warwick from his time as both a senator and as a president. I honour and acknowledge Warwick Parer and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know him over the years.

            I rise to speak on the condolence motion to honour the life of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Parer" rel="nofollow">
             Warwick Parer
            </a>
            , a person I got to know in the political field here in Canberra. I knew of his reputation prior to my coming to Canberra, in 1990. He had already arrived here in 1985, as a senator.
           </p>
           <p>
            I got to know Warwick when he became a minister after
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
             John Howard
            </a>
            won the 1996 election. He was the minister for resources and energy and I was the minister for veterans' affairs in that first Howard ministry. There were times when we would sit down together. I well recall that Warwick's father lost his life in 1942. Warwick was born in Papua
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
             New Guinea
            </a>
            . There was the connection to his background, his birthright of having been born in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
             Papua New Guinea
            </a>
            and losing his father. In fact, his uncle,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Parer" rel="nofollow">
             Damien Parer
            </a>
            , was a very well-known wartime correspondent and photographer with some photographs that will stand the test of time as they captured moments in history.
           </p>
           <p>
            I return to Warwick. As Minister for Resources and Energy, certainly well before what we might call the mining boom that we have seen recently, he brought to the portfolio experience in the coal industry. The great
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
             Bowen Basin
            </a>
            in Queensland was one that he had a great deal to do with, in terms of some of the companies that invested there. He had first-hand knowledge of the industry and what would be good for the industry in terms of legislative areas that were a barrier to the export of coal. Thinking back to some of the barriers and some of the regulations that were imposed on the energy sector—in this case, the coal industry—you would think that it could not have happened and would not have been the case, but, in fact, it was. Warwick brought very particular knowledge to that portfolio of Energy and Resources. At that time, the Bowen Basin was well and truly in my constituency of Maranoa, so I could call on Warwick to share his knowledge and understanding of what would be a good way forward in some of the new tenements that were being developed, and he would know the pitfalls. He would always tell it to you straight. There was no nonsense about Warwick. He was honest to the core. His judgement was always unquestionable and I always respected his opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other time that I really got to know him was when he was President of the Queensland Liberal Party in 2006 to 2008. At the time, I was President of the Queensland National Party. The situation was that the National Party had more seats in Queensland than the Liberal Party held in the state parliament. Year after year, there were agreements and disagreements between the two conservative parties. I said to Warwick, 'We've got to try to end this,' because we were trying to sort out who could run in a particular seat and whether there were more potential Liberal Party voters than National Party voters in areas. It was one of those ridiculous discussions, because at the end of the day we were talking about the same goal: winning government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will never forget being in the seat of Bowman and talking about who might run in the state seat in the Bay area. It had previously been held by the National Party but had been lost. It was won by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beattie" rel="nofollow">
             Peter Beattie
            </a>
            of the Labor Party, and a number of seats in the south-east corner were held by the Labor Party—more than should have been, but that is because the two parties were always fighting each other. Warwick and I acknowledged that the business community had come to us and said, 'While you two fight each other, we are not going to back you. When you get the house in order, we are prepared to consider supporting you and being an advocate for common sense and also for the conservative cause in Queensland.' Having Warwick there was pivotal in establishing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
             LNP
            </a>
            in Queensland. I have no doubt about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to understand that political parties have long history. Members, senators and the general membership also have very long history. Sometimes they want to look further back than forward, but Warwick always wanted to look forward, as did I. We started the long process of bringing the two parties together, and we got them together. We had a stumble, but eventually it led to the formation of the LNP. The record stands itself today, both at a state level and here in Canberra.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I say that, without Warwick Parer at that time, I really would have to question whether we would ever have got together in Queensland and whether we would have seen the numbers of conservative-held seats contributed from Queensland to this federal parliament or, indeed, Premier Campbell Newman's massive win in the last election at the state level. Without Warwick Parer, perhaps none of what has transpired since would have happened. We might still have been arguing amongst ourselves and deciding who should run in which seats. I think my two colleagues to my right here, the member for Brisbane and the member for Ryan, can attest to the difficulties that were there. When you are in politics it can be difficult, but I hope part of my nature and part of Warwick's experience is knowing how to nuance the two parties so we came together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Warwick left this place—and he did leave on his own terms, and that is something that everyone tries to do—it did not end his commitment to community or his service to the nation. He served on a number of organisations, including, in 2012, being appointed chairman of the board of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanwell_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
             Stanwell Corporation
            </a>
            , an energy company to which I know he would have brought great knowledge and expertise and which plays a fundamental part in electricity generation in Queensland. He was chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation from 2010, so he was retired from public life but he still wanted to give something in a public sense. He did that right up to the day he sadly passed away.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say also to his wife, Kathi, and his seven children: Kathi, I know the great support that you gave Warwick throughout his life. On occasion we would meet—my own wife, Joan, and I and Warwick—and we would enjoy each other's company as wonderful friends, not necessarily political friends, although we were political friends, but it was all about the friendship that was always there. The hand of friendship was always extended from Warwick for people to come and see his family, as the member for Moncrieff said, down at their Budds Beach holiday home. So I say to Kathi: thank you to your family for what you did to support Warwick and, of course, your children as they grew up. Thank you for giving Warwick to this parliament and for the contribution that he has made in public life. I say to you, Kathi, on behalf of my wife, Joan, that we are sincerely saddened by the passing of Warwick. To your children I say: we want you to accept our condolences and our deepest sympathy. Warwick, may you rest in peace.

             . Tragically, he passed away last Friday, leaving behind Kathi, an incredibly supportive wife—they really were a partnership in so many ways—their seven children and many grandchildren. Queensland will be the poorer for the loss of Warwick's guidance and vision. His strong leadership as chairman of the

              Stanwell Corporation

             over the past few years has been invaluable, and indeed he worked continually up to his tragic death last Friday. In addition to Warwick's distinguished career in public service, he also lent his business acumen and perspective to the field of innovation as a former chairman of the Energy and Transport Advisory Sector of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

             , Warwick's father and family held many timber leases. Indeed, his father, Kevin, pioneered aviation up there with

            </p>
            <p>
             Warwick was educated at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudgee_College" rel="nofollow">
              Nudgee College
             </a>
             in Brisbane and completed a commerce degree at the University of Melbourne, and later went on to become the commercial manager of Utah Development Company. Warwick was a leader in negotiating contracts between Australian exporters and the emerging Japanese markets for coal from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
              Bowen Basin
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike many of my colleagues who knew Warwick through his political and parliamentary career, the first time I got to meet Warwick was when he left Utah and formed a company called Queensland Energy with his colleagues Ken Foots and Peter Gilchrist. This was back in the late seventies. I was working for an
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
              IT
             </a>
             company in the same building, and Warwick purchased a computer from us to set up their new business. Back in those days we had some very entertaining moments trying to work out how this computer operated. That was the first time I got to meet Warwick and I got to know him and his family even better over the subsequent years.
            </p>
            <p>
             While he was in Melbourne he had
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
              Sir Robert Menzies
             </a>
             as his local member, and this initially sparked Warwick's interest in politics. Back in Queensland, faced with Minister Connor's approaches to resources investment, he became very active in the Liberal Party and served on many political committees.
            </p>
            <p>
             Warwick was a pioneer, being the first to properly introduce the Liberal Party to the mining sector in Queensland. His bold efforts with Winchester South coalmine will always be remembered. Warwick was one of the relatively few senior Queensland businessmen actually involved in the Liberal Party at the time and shaped its mining and resources policy in the 1970s and 1980s. Warwick was said to have brought a depth of understanding to the resources portfolio that nobody else in the parliament could match.
            </p>
            <p>
             Warwick entered the Senate to fill the vacancy created when
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Martin" rel="nofollow">
              Kathy Martin
             </a>
             resigned from the Senate in November 1984 to contest the division of Moncrieff at the 1984 election. There was controversy at the time, when the then
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
              Queensland Premier
             </a>
             , Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was tempted to knock back his nomination, not just because it represented another opportunity to give the Liberals a bit of a kick at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among Warwick's peers in the mining industry, he never disguised his unease at the political patronage which often seemed to determine the granting of mining leases in Queensland. Like most mining men at the time, he was also critical of the state government's charges on a depressed industry and the continued 'open arms' policy of the government at the time towards foreign investment and its then grip on Australian resources. Back then he gave an interview to a local journalist, saying: 'Foreign ownership is like a constant haemorrhage of Australian profits. We now have our own expertise and we should be taking advantage of it.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Warwick served in the first Howard ministry as Minister for Resources and Energy from March 1996 until 21 October 1998. I remember he regularly introduced himself at events emphasising that he was the Minister 'for' Resources and Energy, not the 'minister against resources and energy'—which he thought some predecessors in previous governments had been. While he was not reappointed to the ministry after the 1998 election, Warwick continued in the Senate until his retirement in February 2000, when our now Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, was chosen to fill his vacancy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly after resigning from the Senate, Warwick was appointed a director of several coal companies. He led the Queensland Liberal Party from 2005 to 2008, working, as we heard, with our colleague the member for Maranoa as party president of the National Party to prepare for the amalgamation of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
              LNP
             </a>
             . He not only had the strong backing of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
              John Howard
             </a>
             but also was highly respected by the Queensland members of the Liberal Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             I refer to a speech that former Senator Hill—a fellow senator in this place and a colleague of ours—made at the time of Senator Parer's retirement from the Senate. He commented that Warwick had had a distinguished career in the mining industry before his contribution to politics. He said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             … he brought to us a great deal of practical experience in that industry which balanced the many theorists that we have in this place.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought that was a fitting tribute, given the very practical and knowledgeable contribution that Warwick made not only as minister but to our parliament.

             Warwick's many years of public service and long contribution to the people of Queensland will always be remembered. I join with my colleagues in expressing our sympathy to Kathi and the Parer family.

             <p>
              I am pleased to join with colleagues from both sides of the chamber to recognise the life of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Parer" rel="nofollow">
               Warwick Parer
              </a>
              . I had the privilege of knowing Warwick during his service as a senator and a minister in the Howard government, and he quickly earned my respect and, I know, the respect of all of his colleagues. He was determined. He was honourable in the true sense of the word. He was an achiever. He was a man who had a vision for Australia, a particular passion for the mining industry and the resource sector, and he was a man who made a real difference in Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like most Queenslanders, Warwick was parochial, a fierce advocate for his state, and an Australian dedicated to development and progress. He passed just a few weeks short of his 78th birthday, having been born in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
               New Guinea
              </a>
              in 1936. He was a nephew of Australia's renowned
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">

              </a>
              . The devastation of war was sheeted home to Warwick at a tender age when he lost his father in New Guinea in 1942 following the result of a Japanese attack on his aircraft as he prepared to take off from the airstrip at Salamaua.
             </p>
             <p>
              Warwick was educated in Brisbane and at the University of Melbourne, where he gained a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Commerce" rel="nofollow">
               Bachelor of Commerce
              </a>
              . He developed a keen and deep knowledge, over decades, of the mining and energy industries that are so central to the development of his state of Queensland and our nation. Warwick founded the non-destructive testing laboratories, a facility widely used for materials testing in engineering, aeronautics and medicine, in 1962.
             </p>
             <p>
              He had a distinguished career in the private sector before taking on public office. He became commercial manager and assistant secretary of the Utah Development Company in 1973 and chairman of the Australian coal exporters in 1976. He pioneered the development of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
               Bowen Basin
              </a>
              coalfields for the Japanese market, a development which helped to transform the state of Queensland and enable it to develop the kinds of infrastructure and services that have held the state proud in subsequent decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              Few people have entered parliament with the depth of Warwick's understanding of his industry and the Australian national interest at stake in mining and energy. He knew it well. He appreciated its capacity to transform Australia and had played an active role in bringing this industry to fruition. His service as Minister for Resources and Energy between March 1996 and October 1998 reflected his deep understanding. The portfolio suited his skills and experience perfectly. He was especially proud, as resources minister, of his abolition of export controls on minerals. Those controls had dated back to the Whitlam years. Warwick would not have been out of place in today's government, cutting a swathe through the red tape hampering national prosperity. He turned the first sod for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation's building, and he also chaired the first meeting of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">

              ministers in Sydney.
             </p>
             <p>
              As resources minister, his tasks were about more than mining and energy. He played a key role in preserving and protecting the Patagonian toothfish. As the minister for natural resources, he led the charge for the government to move in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Navy
              </a>
              to enforce Australian fishing regulations and arrest a number of ships that were fishing illegally in Australia's Antarctic waters. There is also the famous occasion when Warwick took on the Japanese under the bluefin tuna convention. He believed the Japanese to be unreasonable in demanding a take under what he thought was a ruse of science, putting ocean tuna stocks at risk. Despite all of the departmental and other advice of the time advocating compromise, Warwick declared, 'No, this is wrong in principle'. His strident approach was to effectively ban the Japanese take. While controversial at the time, his stance was later vindicated through the courts, forcing a change in tack from the Japanese towards compromise.
             </p>
             <p>
              These are examples symbolic of the man: strong when he needed to be and pragmatic in dealing with problems fairly and with a strong sense of natural justice. After his retirement in 2000, Warwick continued to contribute very generously to Australian public life. As others have mentioned, he served as President of the Queensland Liberal Party between 2006 and 2008, and was Chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation from 2012.
             </p>
             <p>
              Warwick was a longtime champion of the merger of the Queensland National and Liberal parties, determined to see it through for over a decade—and the member for Maranoa spoke previously about his role in one of the first attempts to bring the parties together. He believed in that cause and was supportive as the opportunities arose later for that merger to be realised.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would catch up with Warwick regularly. He was a regular attendee at my annual Brisbane Conservative Club post budget breakfast addresses. He still attended
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
               LNP
              </a>
              conferences regularly and campaign launches and other important party events but also he was still regarded very highly in mining industry circles not only for his contribution as a practitioner in the industry but also as a minister who understood and cared about the industry and wanted to see it grow and prosper. He remained a true champion of conservative politics, Queensland's progress and national growth throughout his life.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a personal note, Warwick's chief of staff during the time when he was a minister was David Whitrow, and David has been my chief of staff now for around a decade. David also has fond memories of working with Warwick, whom he admired as a boss and as a partner in endeavouring to deliver reform in the mining sector. Australian industry, the mining sector in particular, is much better and stronger because of the role played by Warwick Parer and his lifetime of service to the industry.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our thoughts are with his wife Kathi, their seven children and, I understand, 26 grandchildren, so it is a very large family—all of whom will grieve his loss. Those of us who shared the parliament with him also grieve his loss and recognise his contribution as a senator, in particular, to Australian industry and commerce. I salute a great Australian and may he rest in peace.
