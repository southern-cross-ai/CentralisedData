        community of Lindsey have rolled up their sleeves to help make our nation one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world against COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister outline how this tremendous effort means we can safely live with the virus and look ahead to 2022 with confidence for a stronger future and more strong Morrison government management?

         As we come towards the end of this parliamentary year and towards the end of 2021, we are moving forward into 2022, looking firmly out through the front windscreen, as Australians are, as they look forward to this Christmas and summer period. The lockdowns and difficult times of the last 18 months are in the rear-vision mirror, because we are moving into 2022 with a stronger economy emerging and with Australians getting back into jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, over 20 million Australians have now had their first vaccination. I want to thank all those Australians for the amazing job that they have done. In particular, the member for Lindsay will know just how many sacrifices there have been in the work done by people in her community and by members all across this place. I want to sincerely thank Australians for the amazing job that they have done over these difficult past 18 months to two years. We thank Australians for rolling up their sleeves to get this jab because, under the national plan, that means we can open safely and we can remain safely open as we go into 2022 and those jobs come back, the businesses come back and the livelihoods come back. Australians can plan for the future with confidence under the strong economic management of our government looking forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank those Australians for doing their bit and playing their part, especially our health workers—nurses, doctors and pharmacists—who have been out there every single day. I want to thank our Indigenous communities and Indigenous leaders for the way that they have worked hard to keep their communities safe and have worked so closely with governments around the country. I want to thank those mental health support workers who have been on the end of phones and reaching out to Australians doing it tough, young people especially. I want to thank, in particular, headspace and the work done by Lifeline, Kids Helpline and
