        I want to acknowledge the importance of the Sikh community in Woolgoolga and surrounds. The Woolgoolga district is a very beautiful part of our country, and it has the added bonus of having a large Sikh component in its population. In fact, the first Sikh temple in Australia was built at Woolgoolga. The Woolgoolga community has been in existence for well over 100 years, and prior to white settlement the area was inhabited by the Indigenous Gumbaingirr tribe. The name Woolgoolga came from 'weelgoolga', which was the Aboriginal name for a local wild berry plant. When you drive into Woolgoolga you see a spectacular pure white temple with golden domes and minarets, and Indian elephant in front of the palace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The early Sikh migrants came to pre-Federation Australia as free settlers. They were predominantly males, who left their families behind and came here to make their fortunes before returning home. Some did return, but the majority of them developed a love and attachment to this country and its people; they remained to lay the foundations of the Australian Sikh community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The early Arcadian settlers came from the farming community of the Punjab. The first Sikhs came to Woolgoolga in the late 1800s. Initially they worked as labourers on the banana plantations, but later acquired leasehold and freehold banana plantations. Sikh migrants from other parts of Australia were attracted to this area once they were aware of an established Sikh community and that a good living was to be made in banana plantations.

        Among the Sikhs who came to Woolgoolga in the late 1800s were

        and Rap Chand. The first permanent resident of Woolgoolga was Labu Singh from Belga and Booja Singh from the Malpur Arkan district in Jalandhar. Booja Singh was the first Sikh to purchase a banana plantation, in Holloways Road, and a residence, in

        . There are now more than 2,000 Sikhs in the Coffs Harbour City Council area. More than 400 students are enrolled at Woolgoolga Public School; 20 per cent of them are Sikhs. At

        more than 10 per cent of the children have Sikh heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of the Sikh community would not have been possible without the welcome and the encouragement of the community. There are many anecdotes of the community assisting Sikh migrants in business, financial affairs, correspondence and encouragement to maintain their culture and their religion. In fact, there were three members of the community on the first committee which built the first Sikh temple. Amongst the Woolgoolga Sikh community, we have solicitors, teachers, doctors, engineers, town planners, accountants and policemen, amongst many other professions.

        They have been instrumental in establishing a blueberry coop, which had $120 million turnover last year, and employ many people in our region. They have contributed very much to the local economy. By maintaining their culture, religion and heritage, they have contributed to the ethnic and cultural diversity of the town, thereby giving Woolgoolga its unique and distinctive character. Woolgoolga truly is a microcosm of today's multicultural Australia. I am grateful to them for making their home in this country. I thank them for the wonderful contribution they have made over many generations not only to our community but also, indeed, to our country.
