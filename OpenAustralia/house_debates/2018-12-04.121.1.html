        As I reflect back on 2018 and think of all its political drama, these words seem poignant:

        I believe passionately that politics is for people. It is not an elite sport played only by members of parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        These words were spoken by former Prime Minister

        back in November 2004 in his first speech to the Australian parliament as the member for Wentworth. It's increasingly apparent that Australians in 2018 have made a decision to no longer sit on the sidelines of politics but speak loudly and proudly about what they want for their towns, cities, states and nation. From students taking time out from school to protest the government's lack of climate change policy through to our

        business leaders banding together with local schools across Corio to work towards a solution to the northern suburbs youth employment crisis, 2018 has been a year when people have opted to get involved and speak about how they want their country to act and behave at a local, state, federal and even global level.
       </p>
       <p>
        In many respects, Geelong had a year full of success. The Geelong port secured a 25-year, $130 million agreement with Boral cement to construct a new clinker-grinding and cement facility at our port.

        finally landed an international airline after many years of hard work and support by governments of both persuasions. Beaver Energy launched its aviation business in Geelong, which will see Geelong refine fuel at more than 50 airports around the country.

        has continued to secure local grants and is expanding its advanced research and technology projects out across Geelong. These all tell a story about the huge steps forward Geelong took this year, which demonstrates the confidence our businesses have in their people and the city's economic future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The year 2018 also saw the Cats secure a place in the finals. The team at GMHBA stadium have commenced work on its final stage of redevelopment, which will cement Geelong's reputation as a sporting and major events powerhouse. Geelong in 2018 can proudly boast it's home to 17,000 small to medium-sized enterprises. Greater Geelong is quickly becoming home to lifestyle-savvy entrepreneurs and business owners. Our city this year continued to build up its credentials as a connected and innovative city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later in the year, the people of Geelong spoke clearly at the ballot box. They rejected fear and populist politics and insisted that state government needed to invest in better infrastructure, health care, schools and more jobs in our city. They voted for Christine Cousins,

        to do exactly that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the revolving door of the Prime Minister's office made yet another rotation this year. In 2018, it is beyond clear that Australians expect better from their federal government. Malcolm Turnbull was dislodged from his position as Prime Minister by the Liberal party room. They voted for change. But I passionately believe that politics is for the people. They will also get a chance to have their say in a few short months, and they always have the final say.
