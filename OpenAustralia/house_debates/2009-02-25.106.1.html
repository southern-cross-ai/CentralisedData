        On previous occasions in parliament I have spoken about the need to increase personal responsibility. Today I would like to make mention of a Cowan community organisation that is in every way an example of community strength and whose members believe in personal responsibility. I speak of the longest-running police ranger unit in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , the Ballajura Police Rangers, based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballajura_Community_College" rel="nofollow">
         Ballajura Community College
        </a>
        and operating since 1995. The Ballajura Police Rangers are an award-winning unit—award-winning as a ranger unit and for being a positive influence on our community. Collectively they won the best drill competition for ranger units in Western Australia in 2006, they were the best unit of rangers in 2007 and they won the

        Each week will see 40 to 50 of the college students taking part in drill, first aid, leadership activities, community service, navigation and bushcraft. The unit is run on a volunteer basis, and I would like to acknowledge the work of those dedicated adults: firstly,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
         Raymond Roberts
        </a>
        , the unit coordinator and a teacher at the school. Raymond has filled that role since 1995. He is a recipient of the WA state government’s Cadets Western Australia Long Service Medal, and he is the author of current WA police rangers training manuals. It is through Raymond’s work that ranger skills across Western Australia have been recognised for credit in year 11 and year 12 subjects. I also acknowledge Senior Constable Grant O’Neil, an instructor since 2001; Alyssa Dawes and Joanna Waroczyk, both teachers and in their first year as instructors; Ross McMullan, a former ranger senior sergeant, twice awarded unit ranger of the year, who graduated from the college in 2004 and is in his fourth year as an instructor; Aimee Retallack, a former ranger sergeant who graduated in 2006 and is in her third year as an instructor; and

         Michael Drayton
        </a>
        , a former senior ranger. I would also like to congratulate 2009 ranger sergeant Ismail Ziba. Ismail is a year 12 student and in his fifth year of being a ranger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last time I was down at the college, a week ago, I saw that the rangers had just finished their evening parade. They were very well dressed in dark blue polo shirts, with instructors in a white version. They looked smart, and it was clear that they held great pride in their unit and what they were doing. As I said at the outset, I believe in community strength and personal responsibility. Through excellent organisations such as the Ballajura Police Rangers, led by dedicated and committed leaders and filled with enthusiastic and community focused young people, we are right to believe in a stronger and more positive community.
