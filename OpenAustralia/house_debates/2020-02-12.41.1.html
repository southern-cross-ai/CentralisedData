        Last weekend I had the pleasure of attending the 144th Nowra Show. I've been going to the Nowra Show for as long as I can remember—since before I could walk. I was honoured to attend this year as patron. This year was a little unusual. For starters, it was pouring with rain. But not a single person was complaining. After our horror summer of bushfires, it felt like sweet relief. It didn't keep people away either. Up to 7,000 people came along. It was also free. The Nowra Show Society made the effort to bring our community together after the trauma we have all endured. What better place could there be to announce that the Currowan fire, which burned for 74 days, was finally out? It was a true cause for celebration, and celebrate we did. To show our appreciation for all their amazing work, the local

        community so special. Congratulations to all the stallholders, exhibitors and winners on your amazing efforts at the show and over the year. I want to say a special thanks to President Mark Stewart, Secretary Robyn Nelson and all of the Nowra Show Society for yet another remarkable year. You absolutely achieved your aim this year, giving us something to celebrate. Thank you, and see you next year.
