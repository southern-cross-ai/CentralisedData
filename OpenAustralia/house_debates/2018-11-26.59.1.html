        I see our schools as sitting at the very heart of our local communities. It's an exciting time of year right now for students, teachers and parents as the school year comes to an end and students graduate. I held my annual Christmas card design competition again this year for primary school students around Brisbane, and this year the chosen theme was Australian animals at Christmas. The quality of entries, as always, was very high and the judging panel had a very difficult task in front of them.
       </p>

        I want to congratulate all the students who participated in the competition, and I'm pleased to announce the winners here again this year. The overall winner was Isis Bamman in year 3 at Newmarket State School. The prep/year 1 winner was Aadhya Singh in prep at Brisbane Central State School. The year 2 winner was Arwyn Feehely at Newmarket State School. The year 3 winner was

        Because of the high quality of entries, this year some highly commended certificates were also awarded to

The winners and highly commended entries will be featured again in my annual Christmas card that will be hitting every mailbox in the Brisbane electorate in the lead-up to Christmas. It's a great way of displaying the young artistic talent we enjoy in Brisbane.
