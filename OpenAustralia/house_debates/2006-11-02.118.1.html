        I vividly remember my emotions when I had the privilege of attending the Anzac Day service in Gallipoli in 2005. I was assailed by a sense of history, by feelings of great sadness and by feelings of great pride. In particular, I felt a great sense of personal debt to those countrymen who had been there before me in that place—those who were there at a time which history now records as one of Australia’s finest hours.

        Australian troops earned a reputation for their gallantry and courage under dreadful conditions. Gallipoli, Simpson and his donkey, the charge of the light horse at Beersheba: all of these reinforced the narrative of mateship, endurance and courage which underpin our Australian culture. As
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEW" rel="nofollow">
         CEW

        Bean, the official war historian, so eloquently wrote, Australian troops were:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Steadfast until death—just the men that Australians at home know them to be. Into the place with a joke; a dry, cynical Australian joke as often as not, holding fast through anything that man can imagine. They’re not heroes. They do not intend to be thought or spoken as heroes. They’re just ordinary Australians, doing their particular work as their country would wish them to do it.
       </p>

        , from 1914 to the present day, Australians have always served their country with courage and distinction. To those who served in the Great War, we owe more than can ever be repaid. We honour their memory. We do remember them. And to paraphrase the words of CEW Bean, we pray to God we are worthy of them. Lest we forget.
