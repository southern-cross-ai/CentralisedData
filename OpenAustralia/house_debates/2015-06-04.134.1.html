       <p>
        I rise to speak on a matter of great importance not only for the people in the electorate of Macquarie but also for those across our great nation. I wish to speak on the importance of automated external defibrillators—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AED" rel="nofollow">
         AED
        </a>
        s—and a vital project that is currently being run throughout the Hawkesbury region in the electorate of Macquarie. The project I am referring to is the Windsor Rotary's Hawkesbury Heartstart Campaign. The founder of this valued campaign is Dr Ravi Sahasrabuddhe, a local Windsor Rotarian and respected local doctor who has been in the Hawkesbury region for more than 42 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, most of us will know someone who has suffered a heart attack. Timing to assist patients is crucial. According to St Johns Ambulance Australia, for every minute a person waits for defibrillation, the chance of survival decreases by 10 per cent. Each year, some 30,000 Australians will be unfortunate enough to experience a sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest does not discriminate against gender or age. And unfortunately, less than five per cent survive, and this can be often because help cannot be reached in time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defibrillation is the process of attempting to restore the heart's normal rhythm. When used, defibrillators recognise any abnormalities in the heartbeat and detect whether a shock is required or not. If a shock is required, it will be delivered by the defibrillator via electrode pads attached to the person's chest. Dr Ravi is looking to get at least 12 more defibrillators in the Hawkesbury to be installed as a matter of priority across the Hawkesbury community: in schools, clubs, swimming pools and sporting facilities, just to mention a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why Dr Ravi teamed up with Windsor Rotary Club in search of an avenue to drive this program. The Windsor Rotary's Hawkesbury Heartstart Campaign was initiated and launched at the Richmond Club on 15 May 2015. Windsor Rotary's Hawkesbury Heartstart campaign aims to: educate the community about what action to take when a sudden cardiac arrest situation arises; increase the currently low numbers of defibrillators available in the local community; make the location of defibrillators available to the public easy to find and known to the 000 operators; assist sporting and community organisations in acquiring a defibrillator either by assisting in their purchase or assisting the organisation financially if necessary; arrange training in the use of defibrillators.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each unit costs approximately $2,700 each and so the heartstart campaign is asking the community to jump on board and help fundraise. The people of the Hawkesbury are a close, warm-hearted and connected community and it is heart-warming how many have already put up their hands to get started. Organisations such as Chesalon nursing home at Richmond,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_Village" rel="nofollow">
         Hawkesbury Village
        </a>
        , Windsor bowling club and St Peters Anglican Church at Richmond have jumped on board and are committed to raising funds to purchase their own defibrillators. The Richmond Club is a great backer of this cause. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chisolm Catholic Primary in

        , which has recently purchased a defibrillator after a year 4 student collapsed.
