        Young people have great ideas. They often surprise us with how they see the world and what they are truly experiencing. But it's not often that young people get the opportunity to speak truthfully and from the heart about what matters to them. That's why it was a great privilege for the Minister for Youth and me to host a youth roundtable in my electorate of Corangamite over the winter break. Together we spoke with 12 remarkable young leaders, from the Surf Coast to the Bellarine, the Golden Plains and the wider region. It was a revealing discussion about life after COVID, social media, and how young people interact with their peers and determine their goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Guided by these young leaders, the pillars of our discussion emerged: education and mental health, two critical aspects that shape the lives of so many young Australians. What became clear through our discussion was that the pandemic's impact on our education system and the wellbeing of our youth has been profound. They told us they feel less confident to socialise and communicate face to face. This was a revelation to me. It's something that our Minister for Education and the Minister for Youth and our Albanese government are grappling with, and it is now the key focus of two reviews currently underway, one focusing on schools and the other focusing on universities. We certainly recognise that mental health is also so important, and I'll soon be announcing the site for a new headspace in the growing suburb of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, the minister launched the national youth survey, an initiative that invited young people aged from 12 to 25 to share their thoughts, experiences and aspirations. The input we received from our young Australians is invaluable in informing a comprehensive youth engagement strategy. Through consultation like the surveys and our roundtables, our government is determined to create meaningful opportunities for young people to do well, to achieve in their lives and, importantly, to be well, to be happy and to feel that they are contributing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the Minister for Youth and the Minister for Education for their commitment to listen to and act on the voices of young people. In particular, I thank the 12 young citizens who took time during their holidays to share with me their aspirations and their insights. This does make a difference. We need to find ways for young people to speak up to say what matters to them.
