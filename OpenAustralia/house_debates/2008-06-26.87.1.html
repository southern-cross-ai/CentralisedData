       <p>
        On Tuesday I had a great moment—it was a highlight of my parliamentary time so far—with the visit by a group of teachers and students from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Senior_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Warwick Senior High School
        </a>
        . It was a great event. They spent a couple of hours here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , commencing with a parliamentary role play. I think everyone had a good time with that activity. Of the teachers, Donald Green was a photographer for the role play, Ian McAlpine was an assistant clerk, Emma Brennan sat on the government back bench and Britany Neale, the chaplain for the school, sat on the opposition back bench, which is a great location for all good people. The students did have a very good time with the role play, and I would like to thank Anne Nelson of the Parliamentary Education Office for her efforts.

        Then we moved on for tours of the House and the other place with the tour guide. Our tour guide, Maggie, did a great job. Whilst I was on part of the tour, I had some very good conversations with three of the students,

        , Kristian Fenn and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . These three young men displayed a keen interest in the parliamentary system and, as they are all locals, a very keen interest in the important local issues in the electorate of Cowan. We had discussions about hooning and also about road safety. I think it was Shane Smith who raised concerns with me about

        in Ashby in the electorate of Cowan. That was a good moment, and it is very pleasing to see those three young men and the rest of the students from the very good school of Warwick Senior High here with a committed interest in how the parliament operates and clearly a committed interest in their communities.

        of Warwick Senior High School is Lesley Wintle, who I have had some contact with in the past. The school is located within my home suburb of Warwick. It has a good reputation and a great academic extension program. I look forward to future visits by Warwick Senior High School in the future and, based on my observations of how good those young men and women are and the interest they showed whilst they were here, I think this country is well placed.
