        , from Narara, has finished an impressive seventh in the moguls. In an event usually dominated by Canada, the 19-year-old qualified for the finals in cold three-degree temperatures. He was eliminated from the medal race by finishing seventh in the second final, but by the slimmest of margins: 0.01. Matt is at his first Winter Olympics and his talent is undeniable. At the world championships last year, he placed fourth. He has been chasing his Olympic dream for most of his life, including his time at

She has embraced the technique of sit-skiing and loves hurtling down a mountain at top speed in her custom-built sled. Congratulations to Victoria and Matt and both their families. They are superb representatives of our electorate on a world stage.
