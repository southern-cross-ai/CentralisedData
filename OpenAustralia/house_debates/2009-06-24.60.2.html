        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer’s previous answers regarding the preferential treatment provided to Mr John Grant, his friend and benefactor. Is the Prime Minister confident that the Treasurer’s answers in the House have been ‘an honest and comprehensive account’ as required by his own standards of ministerial ethics? Is the Prime Minister confident that the Treasurer has acted with fairness as required by his own standards of ministerial ethics? Does the Prime Minister have full confidence in the Treasurer’s administration of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">

        , especially in the way he looked after the Prime Minister’s mate?

         I, as Prime Minister, have absolute confidence in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia
         </a>
         . I say that in the full confidence that those sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition today have passing and fading confidence in him. We have here a Leader of the Opposition who stands in this chamber in a state of denial, as if somehow the events of this week have simply not happened, that they have just passed by, that they are of no consequence whatsoever and that it is all simply a bad dream that will go away. I have something to say to the Leader of the Opposition: this is not a bad dream that will just go away; it is a nightmare and it will not go away. It goes to the future of the Leader of the Opposition’s tenuous hold on his position in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the Leader of the Opposition as he continues on this particular matter: if he wants to look carefully at the consequences for himself they go to two matters: (1) his entire integrity has been shattered by this process and (2) his authority within his own party has been equally undermined and shattered as well—as seen by three sets of policy splits across the coalition. There have been three major matters before this parliament where he cannot even command the unity of his party.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also say to the Leader of the Opposition, who was asked about this matter this morning: if we need some sort of bellwether as to how things are going over that side of the House on this matter we need look no further than the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

               The question I was asked concerned my confidence in the Treasurer. I affirmed that in my opening statement in response to this question. The member for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                North Sydney
               </a>
               , who desperately does not want to hear this, was asked another question by
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jones" rel="nofollow">
                Tony Jones
               </a>
               last night. Jones said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This is what Mr Turnbull said on AM this morning: ‘I’ve certainly spoken to Mr Grech, I know Mr Grech.’
              </p>
              <p>
               That is the attribution to the Leader of the Opposition. Jones asked:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               It is still unclear, though, what he spoke to him about. Do you,

                Joe Hockey

               ’s answer was this—another unqualified statement of solidarity and support:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Well, that’s a matter for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
                Malcolm Turnbull
               </a>
               and

                Godwin Grech
               </a>
               , isn’t it?
              </p>
              <p>
               That is what I would call 100 per cent loyalty! You know that if you are in a scrap you would want the member for North Sydney standing loyally behind you. What a rock solid wall of defence he represents!
              </p>
              <p>
               On this matter, not only has the integrity—that which remains—of the Leader of the Opposition been fundamentally shattered by this forged email affair; on top of that his authority within the Liberal Party has been destroyed. On three major matters before this parliament, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
               </a>
               , alcopops and immigration policy, his authority is so undermined he cannot even unite his party and unite the coalition in a single vote—and they are so desperate on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
                CPRS
               </a>
               that they voted in the Senate to avoid voting. I say to those opposite who raise these matters that the Leader of the Opposition’s integrity has disappeared; his authority has disappeared. There is one reasonable thing for him to do under these circumstances: to stand, to apologise and to resign.
