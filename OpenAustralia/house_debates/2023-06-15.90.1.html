          Thank you. My question is to our Attorney-General. What action has the Attorney-General taken to improve integrity in government after a decade of denial and delay?

           I do thank the member for

           for his question, and I have to say there is a long list. Since coming to office just over a year ago, I've been astounded at the amount of work that was ignored or deliberately not progressed by the former government.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'll start with the National Anti-Corruption Commission. On 1 July 2023 Australians will finally have a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission as they were promised over four years ago by the former government. It'll be one with power to prevent, detect and investigate corruption across the entire federal public sector. We're going to abolish the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
            Administrative Appeals Tribunal
           </a>
           and replace it with a review body which serves the interests of the Australian community, not the interests of the Liberal Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           We've restored integrity to the process for appointments to the position of the Australian Human Rights Commissioner and we're restoring the transparent and accountable appointments process for judicial appointments—again, something that's lost on those opposite.
          </p>
          <p>
           We've passed the Respect@Work legislation—another job left half done by the former government—which now requires businesses across the country to take proactive steps to create workplaces that are safe from the risk of sexual harassment. It's a major step forward for our nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           We're reinstating the Standing Council of Attorneys-General which has, under this government, agreed on collective action to address family, domestic and sexual violence. We're investing $14.7 million towards reforming Australia's sexual assault and consent laws as well as developing better prevention services. We're investing $8.2 million in trials aimed at early intervention and the prevention of sexual harm and violence. On this side of the House, we believe in treating alleged victims of sexual assault with respect. When someone is brave enough to come forward with a claim of sexual assault and other workplace mistreatment, their life and private details must not be open for public examination. As the Minister for the Environment and Water has told the House this week, rates of reporting of sexual assault crimes are low and conviction rates are even lower. When a woman who is considering reporting a sexual assault sees a confidential document from another alleged victim published on the front page of a national newspaper, they must ponder whether the report is worth it and whether those in power are going to come after them, too. This is unacceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
           Three people had access to the confidential document, and they are directly named in today's report: the member for Cook, the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Cash, and Senator Reynolds. The confidential document that's on the front page of a national newspaper was published without regard for the interests of an alleged victim of sexual assault. Her rights have not been respected.
