        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House what support the Australian government is providing to communities impacted by the current bushfires, particularly in my electorate of Indi?

         I thank the member for Indi for that question. It goes to something which is of very great concern to me and to Australians living in Victoria. I think we are aware that the situation in Victoria is very serious indeed, with up to 37 fires burning in north-east Victoria and Gippsland, and up to 50 in Victoria more generally. Earlier today I rang the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Victorian Premier
         </a>
         , Mr Bracks, and offered any additional Commonwealth assistance that Victoria might stand in need of. He has indicated that he will be writing to me today in relation to some additional assistance from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that the Attorney-General has approved a request by the Victorian government for assistance in controlling the Victorian bushfires, and this consists of a fuel tanker and a crew to supply diesel to water tankers and machinery such as bulldozers in the Mansfield-Whitfield region. Earlier, in my absence, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Acting Prime Minister
         </a>
         wrote to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Victoria
         </a>
         , assuring him that the Australian government is ready to provide any assistance which Victoria might stand in need of.
        </p>
        <p>
         These bushfires are very serious indeed, and I understand the anxiety of the member for Indi and other members in this place representing those parts of Victoria where the fires are burning fiercely. I want the people of Victoria to know that the Commonwealth will stand side-by-side with the government of Victoria. We will provide any additional assistance that the Premier needs, and the two of us will continue to be in close and cooperative contact to make certain that the right response is given to help the people of Victoria.

          On indulgence, I express the opposition’s appreciation for the support of the Commonwealth to the state government of Victoria in dealing with this current crisis. Bushfires are a terrible thing. They affect people’s lives enormously, and we appreciate the level of cooperation shown on this between the two levels of government.
