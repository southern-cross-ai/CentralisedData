       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to welcome students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        South Public School here in the chamber today. Today, I would also like to acknowledge the fantastic work of a local schoolteacher, Helen Minol, who for 50 years has taught at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady
        </a>
        of the Rosary Catholic Primary School, also in St Marys. Helen's story is absolutely brilliant. She started at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_the_Rosary" rel="nofollow">
         Our Lady of the Rosary
        </a>
        as a primary school student in 1952. She did her primary school years there, went to high school and then came back. In 1965 she came back as a primary school teacher. They had to pay for her out of the money they raised in the canteen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the students have said some fantastic things about the teaching of Mrs Minol. For starters:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You were a great teacher 32 years ago when you taught my mum and you are still a great teacher now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other students said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        God speaks to me through your smile.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You may not remember me, but I remember you. You always have nice words to say about everyone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I remember back in 1965 when we always played with her at lunchtime. We were chasing her around the old grey church/school in Putland St.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Minol, thank you for your service. Thank you for the contribution you have made to Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School and to all of the school students at St Marys.
       </p>
       <p>
        To St Marys South Public School: I hope you have a fabulous day.
       </p>
