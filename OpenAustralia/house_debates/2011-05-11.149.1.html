       <p>
        Townsville is a fantastic city. It is a place where people gather with a positive attitude and we get things done. We respect those who have a go and we look to them for leadership. There should be no differentiation when it comes to this, but there is. Since my election on 21 August last year, I have been besieged with requests to investigate the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Services, or TAIHS. I have received reports of nepotism, bullying, rorting of funding and allowances, and board stacking across the Aboriginal and Islander bodies in Townsville. These concerns over the running of this organisation have been raised previously in this House. In 2008 the then member for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, implored the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, to act. He followed that up with a letter to Minister Macklin to which it would appear that there has never been a response.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a subsequent meeting and airing of these concerns to TAIHS Chair Angie Akee, I asked her to voluntarily open her books for a forensic audit and an audit on the corporate governance. If there was nothing to hide, the allegations would be put to rest once and for all. Mrs Akee politely refused, which was her right. She said that these allegations were motivated by jealousy and that they had heard them all before.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has known about these allegations since 2008 and has done nothing. I have come to the conclusion that this government is totally aware of what is going on in this organisation and others where this family has influence and has deliberately chosen to do nothing. They already know that these organisations are rife with questionable corporate governance and lack financial accountability. The government simply lacks the political will to address this major concern. It follows that this government does not care about the overall health of our first Australians, or that the funds meant for their wellbeing are being misused. This government and Minister Macklin stand condemned by their lack of action here. It has taken a group of Aboriginals and Islanders to stand up and fight for what is right. These people have the courage to stand up against the might of this government and the financial muscle of this organisation. Despite knowing full well that this government does not care, they still come forward with their stories in the hope that something will be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander health, it will appoint administrators to this organisation immediately. If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander accountability, it will instigate a forensic audit of this organisation and all organisations influenced by this family. If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander processes, it will instigate an audit of the corporate governance of all organisations connected to this family. Townsville is a great city and we have great people. Let us hope that this government can see its way clear to represent all of them.
