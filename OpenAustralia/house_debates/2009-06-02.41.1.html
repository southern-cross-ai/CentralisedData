        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the foreign minister tell us what the government is doing about the recent disgraceful attacks on Indian students in Australia?

         I thank the member for his question. Australia takes very seriously its reputation as a safe destination for international students and yesterday in the House the Prime Minister spoke on behalf of, I think, all members and all Australians in deploring and condemning the recent outrageous attacks on young Indians studying or working in Australia. The government again condemns all attacks of this sort, whoever is the target. More than 90,000 Indian students in Australia are welcome guests to our country as are the more than 200,000 Australians of Indian descent, who are welcome members of the Australian community, making a substantial contribution to it. On Friday last week I spoke to my counterpart, External Affairs Minister Krishna, both to congratulate him on his appointment but also to assure him of the seriousness with which the Australian government is addressing these issues. Australia’s

         , has also made the Australian government’s resolve to tackle this issue well known to the Indian authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is working closely with state governments to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice and that relevant government agencies are responding to these crimes to protect all students and others in the Australian community. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Adviser" rel="nofollow">
          National Security Adviser
         </a>
         , Mr Duncan Lewis, is today chairing the first meeting of a new task force to coordinate the Australian government’s response. The task force will include senior officials from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         , the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Attorney-General’s Department. Through this task force the Australian government is showing its resolve to play its part in collaboration with the states to respond to this very serious issue. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education announced on 28 May that international student representatives would be invited to a roundtable to discuss issues affecting their study experience including accommodation, safety and welfare. The Deputy Prime Minister will convene this roundtable in the near future.
        </p>

         also inform the House of the response to this matter by our state colleagues in Victoria. Earlier today I spoke to Premier John Brumby, who shares these concerns, has been strong in his condemnation of these terrible attacks and quick with practical action to meet them. Premier Brumby announced on 28 May that he would look to implement the remaining recommendations of the Victorian government task force on international students commissioned last year. The Victorian government has today committed to amending sentencing guidelines in Victoria to make violence specifically targeted against individuals on the basis of their race, religion, sexuality, age or disability an aggravating factor in recognition of the wider adverse social impact that so-called hate crimes can cause.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Police
         </a>
         has established a community reference group to facilitate communication on safety issues with the Indian community in Victoria. The community reference group has established a 1800 number to provide support, information and advice to Indian students who are victims of crime. The hotline is staffed by volunteers who are fluent in English and Hindi and the volunteers have received training from Victoria Police. The Victoria Police multicultural liaison officer will travel to India later this month to discuss student safety issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         This issue requires a response across the range of governments, state and Commonwealth, and across the range of government agencies. Australia again sends the message to the Indian people that Australia is serious about ensuring the safety of Indian students as we are serious about ensuring the safety of all visitors to our country. Our resolve is reflected not just by our condemnation of recent attacks against Indian students but by our practical action in conjunction with the states and the Indian community in Australia.
