       <p>
        Volunteers are an integral part of our society. They are the glue which binds communities together. In my electorate of Scullin countless volunteers dedicate so much of their time, energy and skills towards improving our community. This is why last Friday I held a Scullin community volunteer awards ceremony to recognise many deserving people in the community. I was particularly pleased to be able to do this after the disruptions of the last several years—a period in which the work of volunteers had been particularly important in holding people together through the challenges of the pandemic and lockdowns.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is so important that we come together as a community to recognise and thank volunteers. I give a shout-out to a particular young woman—Audrey, a 10-year-old from Thomastown. Out of her own concern, she spends her Sundays going to the local park to pick up rubbish. Out of her concern for the amenity of the place in which she lives, this 10-year-old girl is making a real difference and inspiring others. She has been doing this every Sunday since last October and has inspired others to do the same. Audrey, your work is amazing and an inspiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank—although time doesn't permit me to detail the contributions—all those who were recognised at the award ceremony. I'd like to make this point as well: all of these people were recognised by their peers. All of these people were identified by others in the community who saw the difference they make. I want to also thank those nominators, those people who look around them to those who inspire them to make a difference. As well as Audrey, I want to acknowledge in this place Krysti Severi; Hansikaa Sharma; Frank Torcasio; Regina Leung-Huning—and it was so wonderful to see there Regina's daughter, Emily, who's been going through some hard times; Emily, you're in my thoughts now, too—Cherian Peter; Kerryn Holland; Celia Mungcal; Anastasia Xenophontos; Maria Lentile; Carl Reid; Sandra Arceri; Angela Petrucci; Mary Binisoska; Parvinder Singh; Andy Whincup, who makes amazing coffee; Abdullah and Muzna Siddiqui; Connie Testagrossa; Jai Schilling; Noreen Elliot; and Tanya Sharma.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so proud that I was able to meet with these volunteers, personally thank them and acknowledge the enormous contribution they make. They have made an enormous difference to the community and through their example will no doubt inspire others to do so. It is important that we acknowledge these selfless contributions in this place, Australia's parliament, because it is indeed volunteers who make community and volunteers who make a difference.
