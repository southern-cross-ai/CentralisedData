        This week I had the privilege to take part in the public launch of Keeley's Cause, a new initiative in my electorate started by Keeley, a 13-year-old who has autism spectrum disorder as well as an intellectual disability. Keeley's Cause works to provide iPads to school students and others with similar conditions to Keeley. This project was inspired by Keeley's own experiences, where she found that this technology helped her to interact and communicate with others as well as getting her school work done. Some of the recipients of the iPads so far are diagnosed with autism, cerebral palsy,

        </a>
        and Tourette's, amongst other conditions.

        ad technology provides the opportunity for young people with these learning challenges to engage more fully in learning. For those children and adults who are nonverbal, iPads allow them to communicate without words, enabling them to express their opinions and feelings when previously they may have been left more isolated. Where young people are not able to access these aids through the

         NDIS
        </a>
        , Keeley works with local businesses and community organisations—in particular, the Ballan Lions Clubs—to get these children the tools that can help them to achieve at the highest level. Into the future, Keeley's Cause is looking to expand state wide, nationally and even internationally through the Lyons club. I commend Keeley and her family for a terrific local initiative. It's inspiring to see a 13 year old doing so much. Imagine what she is going to be doing at 20!
