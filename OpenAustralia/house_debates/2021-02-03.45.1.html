        When Captain Sir Tom Moore started doing laps of his garden to raise money for Britain's National Health Service, he thought he might just crack a thousand pounds. Armed with his walking frame, he planned to do a hundred laps, one for every year he'd been on this earth. His estimate was a little off. By the time he was done, his beloved

        was better off to the tune of 33 million quidâ€”that's A$57 million.

        Captain Tom served his nation in World War

        , so he knew all about meeting adversity with action, and that is what he did when Britain was brought low by the pandemic. Captain Tom was an inspiration to millions. He brought light when it felt like there was only darkness. Fittingly, he joined forces with

        '. As he became the oldest recording artist with a No. 1 hit, Captain Tom reminded everyone that there will be a golden sky waiting at the end of the storm. This true hero is now gone, but what he leaves is beyond measure. He gave hope not just to those in the

         We're almost at two o'clock, so I think it would be difficult for the member for Forde to say more than a sentence. In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded.
