        I am sure that by now you are starting to believe me when I tell you there is something pretty special about my electorate of Braddon. Today I would like to tell you about a group of talented students from Geneva Christian School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the guidance of Mrs Jane Marks, the students entered the 2014 Focus on Ability Short Film Competition. Now in its sixth year and run by the not-for-profit organisation Nova Employment, the competition is aimed at raising the awareness of the abilities of people with a disability. The film
        <i>

          Open Your Eyes
         </a>
        </i>
        asks the viewer what do they see when they see the star of the film, Phil Acheson. Mr Acheson has a disability, and the film suggests that it is easy to focus on the disability that we see, and not what abilities a person may have. Through a montage of scenes we see that Mr Acheson needs help to live each day with a disability, but at the end it is revealed that the beautiful piano music that has been used to provide the soundtrack is actually being played by Mr Acheson.
       </p>
       <p>
        The film won the judges' choice short film prize and I am confident that the $15,000 prize package won by the school is nothing compared to the pride Mrs Marks has for her students. I would like to congratulate Mrs Marks and the Geneva Christian School for allowing the students to engage in such a productive learning environment. Special congratulations go to Sarah Marks, Joradanne Turner, Jackson Marks, Lewis Lamont,

        , Riley Lodge, and of course the very talented, Phil Acheson. If you want to view the film, you can visit my website: brettwhiteleymp.com.au.
