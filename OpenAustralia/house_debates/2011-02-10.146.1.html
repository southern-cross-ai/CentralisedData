       <p>
        I want to raise three issues in relation to the economic health and welfare, as well as the physical health and welfare, of the people of the Bass Coast. The first is in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Warley Hospital
        </a>
        . Warley Hospital was closed down shortly after the Labor Party came to power at the federal level. They did not continue the pledges made by the previous government for funding of $2½ million to continue the operation of Warley Hospital. There was no action by the then state Labor government in Victoria. The hospital was closed down. The people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        and nearby districts were left without a hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the federal level, the coalition have a standing commitment to provide $2½ million to help assist with the reopening of Warley Hospital, most preferably as an adjunct, a satellite, a campus, a component of the broader Bass Coast Regional Health Network. Given the change of government in Victoria, I will be approaching both the Premier and the new health minister, Mr David Davies, in writing, seeking to commence a process with them to improve health services by reopening Warley Hospital—again, most preferably as an adjunct to the existing Bass Coast Regional Health Network. It is vital to the people of Phillip Island. I will not rest until we have achieved it. Our commitment at a federal level remains good and solid, and I would urge the state government to match that commitment. But this process for reopening Warley Hospital begins now.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second point I wished to make is in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo" rel="nofollow">
         San Remo
        </a>
        lobster fishermen. I know many of the fishermen. We have been in contact with them. There are six boats operating out of San Remo. Up to 95 per cent of their catch is generally exported to China. However, the industry has been dealt two significant blows in recent months. First, in November, China imposed a ban on all Australian lobster imports in an effort to crack down on Chinese importers avoiding state taxes. Second—a factor beyond the control of governments—is the continuing high exchange rate for the Australian dollar, which is generally a good thing for Australia but can have negative consequences for specific sectors. As a result, local lobster that was selling for $65 a kilogram last year is now closer to $40 a kilogram, perilously close to break-even for local lobster fishermen.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        have struck agreements with China in relation to lobster exports to ensure they do not face a significant tariff. Meanwhile, Australian lobster faces a 28 per cent tariff and the temporary ban. It is time for the Australian government to step in and deal with the tariff issue and the ban on Australian lobsters. This is unacceptable. It is slow, there is a delay and the government must take action. There has been paralysis and inaction—not good enough. In the meantime, the Tasmanian government have offered a deferred payment scheme for fishing licences to their lobster fishermen. The previous Victorian state government did no such thing; now that we have a new government, I would urge them to adopt the Tasmanian interim measure of a deferred payment scheme for licences, and I will be contacting and approaching them to that effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last element of the Bass Coast that I wish to raise is this:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Coast_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Coast Shire
        </a>
        has still not received a cent in rates from the desalination plant, despite the then state government acquiring the land in 2008. That is not for want of asking on the part of the Bass Coast Shire. The former state government previously promised to pay rates. I would ask that the current government, now that they have been elected—with a very strong start—recognise that Bass Coast Shire is not a wealthy municipality and badly needs the rate revenue, and take steps to ensure that there is a return on this lost land. It was farming land that was part of the area that is subject to inundation, which is why this desalination plant is proceeding so badly. We all knew it was built on a floodplain. It has had multiple floods since it was built. It was a bad project to start with. Unfortunately, it is proceeding where it is, but it is time now to see if recompense can be made to the people of Bass Coast, with appropriate support from the state, in terms of a return for the land that was taken from the community.
