        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Dunkley by-election is this weekend. The late and great Peta Murphy wanted a full ban on gambling ads, saying, 'It needs to be done, with no room for circumvention.' Will the government honour her call?

         I thank the member for Goldstein for her question and join with her in honouring the late member for Dunkley. Peta Murphy is sadly missed by not just people in the parliament across the spectrum, but certainly by people in her electorate. She had so much more to offer, and I say to Rod and to her family that I know that the passing of time has not dulled the grief that they are feeling. I was there again yesterday, and people are really doing it tough to lose someone aged just 50. The member for Dunkley made an outstanding contribution in her too-short time in this parliament and we recognise the work she did leading an inquiry into online gambling harm and we're indebted to her for her contribution on what is a critical issue.

         We have done substantial work already. We've launched BetStop the national self-exclusion register, through which 18,000 Australians have self-excluded from online wagering and promotions. I table the media release from the Minister for Communications. That has been achieved in just six months. We've mandated customer pre-verification for all new online wagering accounts to prevent children from gambling and strengthen protections for Australians. We've agreed with states and territories on new minimum classifications for video games with gambling-like content. We've implemented new evidence based taglines to replace—

          The Prime Minister was asked a question and he's answering it regarding the reforms that are occurring, so he is being directly relevant. I know there is one specific part of the question the member has asked, but, under the standing orders I've explained before, as long as the Prime Minister is being directly relevant—and he is—to the core topic. I'll hear from the member for Goldstein.

             I say, with respect, to the member that I'm talking about things that are being done right now, not the past—things that we are doing as a government to take action, consistent with what the member for Dunkley asked us to do. We have required online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements outlining wins and losses. We legislated a ban on the use of credit cards for gambling last year, and this will come into effect mid this year and will make a real difference. In addition to that, the Minister for Communications and the Minister for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
              Social Services
             </a>
             are working diligently through all 31 recommendations contained in the report chaired by the member for Dunkley.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government are undertaking relevant consultations, as you would expect us to do, with all stakeholders, including harm reduction advocates and industry. I myself have met with people like

              Tim Costello
             </a>
             about these issues, and we're working through them to make sure that any action doesn't have unintended consequences, because that's what good governments do. The government have been working hard on a comprehensive approach to tackling gambling harm because that's what we're committed to doing.
