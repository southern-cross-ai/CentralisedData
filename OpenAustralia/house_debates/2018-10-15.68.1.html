        My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning, when asked about laws which allow discrimination against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTI
        </a>
        teachers, the Treasurer said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't think these laws are right and I do think we need to ensure that there is no discrimination in either our workplaces or in our schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Prime Minister agree with his Treasurer? Will the Prime Minister join with Labor to ensure that teachers can't be sacked because of who they are or who they love?

        <p>
         I'm happy to table the letter that I sent to the Leader of the Opposition today. I table that letter knowing that I believe it's very important that we act in this parliament over the next fortnight to deal with the unnecessary anxiety that has been created for children and their parents in relation to potential discrimination and expulsion of students on the basis of their sexuality. We think that needs to be addressed, and we think it needs to be addressed urgently.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have written to the Leader of the Opposition in those terms and I have said that there are many other issues that will be addressed as a result of the religious freedoms review that has been undertaken. There will be a time and place to address those issues, and they're important issues, but the issues that we need to address right here and now relate to the children and ensuring that we protect them against discrimination and that we act in the area of absolute consensus, not just in this place but beyond this place, because I know religious communities and schools also believe that they should not, and indeed they do not, discriminate against children on the basis of their sexuality in their schoolsâ€”

           On direct relevance. On this policy issue, the question only went to teachers. It did not go to students at all. There is agreement on the issue of students, but this question is about the principles as they apply to teachers.

            I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I was listening very carefully. The Prime Minister, about 30 seconds ago, addressed the topic of the question in the context of his answer. He's in order. I'm going to keep listening. The Prime Minister's in order.

             As I indeed said, the religious freedom report, prepared by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ruddock" rel="nofollow">

             , addresses a broad range of issues, including the ones that have been raised by the members of the opposition. What I have asked the Leader of the Opposition to do is to come together with the government this week and deal with this issue, on which, beyond this place and within this place, there is broad consensus. We are prepared to do that in absolute good faith. The Attorney-General is preparing amendments to that end and will share those with the shadow Attorney-General. I hope we're able to do that and that we won't be pointscoring and playing politics with this. I hope we can just get it done and give those families and their children the certainty that they deserve, and I hope that the laws, which were indeed introduced by those opposite when they were in government, can be corrected.
