        So often, we as MPs gain inspiration from events in our own electorates, and hearing about the personal triumphs of our constituents, sometimes against the odds, fills us with awe. I wanted to bring one of those stories to the floor of the House—and this is a story whose end will impact on us all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, as the shadow minister and member for Jagajaga has said, we both met then 12-year-old Connor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod" rel="nofollow">

        and his mother, Ally Lancaster, here in parliament. We were both left inspired by the possibility of a remarkable campaign. Connor, who is from Oakhurst within the electorate of Chifley, was born blind. He sensed a basic injustice with a situation that we all take for granted—because he could not tell the difference in the denominations of money he was handling—and he wanted to do something about it. So he came to Canberra, and argued his case. Connor met with people on both sides of the chamber, and I spoke on his behalf in the House. The member for Jagajaga and I met with Connor and his mother. I also questioned the

        governor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Stevens" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , on the issue at a public hearing in Sydney last year. To his credit, the governor said that he would be continuing to look at ways to improve this situation and, aided by the persistence of Connor and his mother, he did just that.
       </p>
       <p>
        After further campaigning through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Vision Australia
        </a>
        , it is fantastic to hear that the Reserve Bank has agreed to introduce tactile notes. I want to wish Connor all the best for what he has done. He has achieved something truly special for the people of Australia and he is owed full credit for that.
