        () (): On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        , I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled
        <i>
         The rollout of
        </i>
        <i>
         the National Broadband Network
        </i>
        <i>
         1s
        </i>
        <i>
         t report of the 45th Parliament
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—In making comment today about this report can I acknowledge the strong contribution by the previous chair, the member for Robertson.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Robertson was the chair of this committee from September last year until June this year—and so led much of this committee's work during its 12 months of operation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This included writing to individuals and organisations, inviting and continuing to accept submissions right up until August.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this way the information the committee received was continually updated throughout the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted in the report, ours was very much a 'live' inquiry about the rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        as it was happening around us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received 191 submissions from a range of individuals and organisations and staged 15 public hearings, taking evidence from every state and territory including regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much of the committee's focus was on the experience of consumers in migrating their telecommunications services to the NBN, as well as the quality and reliability of this service once connected.
       </p>
       <p>
        As was noted when the report was first formally presented to the Speaker and President on 29 September, the bulk of the report contains the views and recommendations of the other side of this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        And just on comments made in relation to the date when the report was presented to the parliament, on the eve of a long weekend and before major football finals, several media outlets decided this must be the work of the government seeking to somehow hide the findings.
       </p>
       <p>
        May I make the point that it was the Labor members of this committee who delayed the original recommendations from myself as chair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only did we end up with a highly politicised overview of the committee's work, we ended up with a further 18 separate recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing I believe still resonates, despite Labor's efforts, is the common-sense decision by this government to deliver the NBN through a multitechnology mix.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet what was the very first recommendation adopted by the Labor Party and the crossbench? Let's toss out all the work the NBN has undertaken. Let's go back to Labor's plan A, developing the entire rest of the network using fibre-to-the-premises or, at a minimum, fibre-to-the curb technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor had their plan A when they were in government, and it flopped!
       </p>
       <p>
        There were numerous cost overruns, delays in meeting their own rollout targets and the interim satellite services they introduced was a shambles.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what do Labor members want? To do it all again—to take another six to eight years longer to complete the build of the NBN, slug taxpayers an additional $29 million and push up people's internet bills by at least $40 a month!
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee did recognise that the government is committed to completing the network and ensuring that all Australians have access to very fast broadband as soon as possible at affordable prices and at least cost to taxpayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As both the chair of this committee and a local member of parliament for a regional area, I recognise that not everyone is experiencing a smooth transition to the NBN.
       </p>
       <p>
        NBN's own surveying indicates that 85 per cent of end users are finding that the service is meeting or exceeding their expectations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of complaints, when you have a committee inviting submissions from people who are experiencing challenges, we're obviously going to hear mainly from those who are unhappy or where the service is not what they had expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes it is an unforeseen technical issue; sometimes it is equipment provided by the retail provider—or one of a hundred other possibilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clear message the committee received was that there needs to be a better way to fix those problems more quickly when they arise—and to keep the customer informed.
       </p>
       <p>
        NBN knows this and is already taking steps to make it happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also why recommendations from our side of the House sought to strengthen the customer experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        The non-government members of the committee have come up with exhaustive commentary—most of it political argument rather than conclusions drawn from evidence taken by witnesses in submissions and public hearings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their recommendations include new audits, new regulations, new reference groups, new regulations and—as usual from Labor—a lot more taxpayers' dollars!
       </p>
       <p>
        Government members of the committee believe the smarter approach is to boost the powers of our existing agencies and authorities to work more closely with the NBN to deliver the broadband that Australia has come to expect, and will receive, from this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Measures are already in place to call NBN and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSP" rel="nofollow">
         RSP
        </a>
        s to account if they don't deliver the speeds consumers have signed up for.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want to put the customer experience front and centre and focus on measures that need to be in place to further resolve their issues when they arrive.

        <p>
         I thank the committee chair for her report and the work that she has put into it—not an easy job running interference for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         in the current environment. I want to speak to the recommendations of the majority of members of this committee. But, before I do, I want to make the observation that for 12 months members of parliament of this place and the other place have travelled the country listening to the stories of consumers, the stories of businesses who've been struggling to have their connections improved and to have their broadband services fixed. We've heard stories of loss, of woe and of problems from one end of the country to the other, so to say that everything is going well simply beggars belief. I recommend to the Prime Minister that when he comes into question time tomorrow he shows a little more humility to those hundreds and thousands of households and small businesses around the country who've lost thousands and thousands of dollars worth of revenue and thousands and thousands of hours out of their lives because the Prime Minister's NBN project is not working.
        </p>
        <p>
         The joint select committee has come up with 23 hard-hitting recommendations on how to get the project back on track. We should not as a country be spending $50 billion on the largest infrastructure project we will see this century only to see service standards and quality go backwards, and yet that is the experience of too many consumers. It is a very rare proposition where we see the Greens,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson's_One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          Pauline Hanson's One Nation
         </a>
         party, the Nick Xenophon Team, Independents and the Labor Party on the one page supporting a series of recommendations. That fact alone should have made government members sit up and say, 'There is something to see here'. There are 23 hard-hitting recommendations on how to get the project back on track, and yet the government members of the committee have not supported them. There have, of course, been a couple of honourable exceptions. The member for Mallee, a man who is obviously in touch with parts of his community, was willing to come out and say, 'You know what, some of these recommendations would make a hell of a big difference in my electorate. They should be looked at.' If only there were more members of the National Party and the Liberal Party who were willing to stand up in defence of their electorates as the member for Mallee was in defence of his.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the 23 recommendations, we agree with the chair that there is an urgent need for new consumer and supplier rights which provide protections, wholesale service levels and remedies for service failures. You might ask why we need a new raft of consumer protections and consumer rights. We currently have a universal service obligation and a customer service guarantee. I'm sure it'll give all members who are present in the chamber and members of the public in the gallery today great comfort to know that the universal service obligation protects their right to a phone booth but not to a decent standard internet service. In this century, it's more attention that's needed to the broadband service than to the phone booth.
        </p>
        <p>
         When something goes wrong, if you are a small business—like the small businesses I spoke to in Rockhampton last week whose internet service went down not only on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Mother's Day
         </a>
         but on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Valentine's Day
         </a>
         as well, or the motorcycle store owner who was watching, on a daily basis, people leaving thousands of dollars worth of goods on the counter to walk out because the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTPOS" rel="nofollow">
          EFTPOS
         </a>
         service wasn't working—you need a little bit more than the sort of condescending response that we got from the Prime Minister today. You need service standards and guarantees that your problems are going to be fixed, and fixed in a timely manner. It's also why we need the introduction of new business-grade products specifically geared towards small business. I'd have thought all of those members who pretend to represent the interests of small business would have got behind this Labor proposal, this Independent proposal, this Greens proposal—the proposal supported by all of the non-government members—and say, 'We need to do more for small business by introducing business-grade products that have service level standards within them.'
        </p>
        <p>
         We have recommended an overhaul of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman because it is well and truly overdue. It might surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to know that we've got a telecommunications industry ombudsman that doesn't even have the power to request the NBN to attend a mandatory meeting and to talk to the consumers and the phone companies when they have caused a problem. What is the worth of an ombudsman if they cannot even do that basic thing? We are recommending in this report that these issues get dealt with as a matter of priority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, you represent a regional electorate. You will know that there is a lot of discontent in regional Australia about the NBN. They are very, very concerned that they are being left behind. They are seeing the rollout of superior technologies in the cities while their services are being delivered on out-of-date technology. Whether it's the copper or the Sky Muster service, it simply isn't meeting their needs. They raise their issues with their local MPs, but it doesn't seem to be getting through. It is for this reason, and to champion the interests of regional and rural consumers, that the majority in the committee are recommending that the government require the establishment of a reference group for the NBN, advising the board on rural and regional matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, I can't for the life of me work out why members of the National Party aren't saying, 'Yes, me too,' on this. Where are the members of the National Party, when you've got advocate groups across the country, from Broadband for the Bush Alliance to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers' Federation
         </a>
         , saying, 'Yes, this is exactly what we need'? Where are the members of the National Party who are willing to stand up and say, 'We need our voice being heard from rural and regional Australia in the places where the decisions are being made'? They're certainly not being made in the coalition party room. That's why this recommendation's got a lot of work to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's disappointing that these recommendations haven't been accepted. It's very disappointing that these recommendations haven't been accepted. For the last two months, I have been travelling around the country with many of my colleagues, holding forums with businesses and with consumers throughout regional Australia. They are all saying the same thing. They are saying, 'We need a broadband service that is going to work. We shouldn't be spending $50 billion on a project only to see service levels go backwards; and, if we live in regional Australia, we shouldn't be paying twice as much for a service that is half as good as the one that people in the city take for granted.'
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased to be speaking on the tabling of this report. I ask all members of the National Party to rethink their position and all members of those regional Liberal Party electorates to rethink their position. Do the right thing by your electorates. Take the recommendations into your party room tomorrow and demand that your minister and your government implement the recommendations of this review.
