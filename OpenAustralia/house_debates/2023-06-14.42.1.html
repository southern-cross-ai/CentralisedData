       <p>
        In October 2012 the Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research was formed. The institute bears the name of one of south-west Sydney's most prominent families and was, in particular, the dream of Bob Ingham, who was born in Casula. The institute is a world-class research facility and has forged unique partnerships with universities and hospitals, and it is committed to improving health outcomes for those living in the south-west. The institute's brief is wide, from cancer, injury, rehabilitation and mental health research to conducting hundreds of clinical trials. Its success has been the result of wonderful philanthropic gifts but also of outstanding leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, the institute announced that its longstanding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Mr Darryl Harkness, would retire on 30 June. Darryl has been the CEO since 2017, after nearly 30 years with Johnson &amp; Johnson. In that time, Darryl has been a champion for the institute and Bob Ingham's dream. He has overseen the growth of the institute and can be proud of his record. He will leave the institute on a very secure footing. I very much appreciate Mr Harkness's support and conversations since I've been the member for Werriwa. I wish him all the best for his retirement, but most especially calm seas.
