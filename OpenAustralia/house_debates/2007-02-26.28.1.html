        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the hard work of a very determined constituent in my electorate of Kingston. Jenny Francis of Christies Beach found out that plans had been submitted to council for approval to build a 24-metre mobile phone tower within 15 metres of her home. Anyone who knows this picturesque area knows that the natural beauty of the area would have been aesthetically compromised if the tower had been erected. The drive down
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Beach Road
        </a>
        , the view from Rotary Park and the foreshore areas would have been affected by the installation of this mobile tower at this proposed site.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenny and the local community were not opposed to the erection of the tower point blank; they simply asked that the tower be located in a more appropriate area. Jenny came to see me to seek support and together we rallied local support to oppose the tower. After collecting over 500 signatures, Jenny and I addressed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Onkaparinga" rel="nofollow">

        â€™s development assessment panel last week and, as a result of our hard work and the community dedication, we were able to convince the panel to reject the application.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jenny and all the members of the local community who supported our campaign against the tower. This was a fine example of what can be achieved when the local community band together and get behind their local member. I would like to thank them for supporting me so I could support them.
