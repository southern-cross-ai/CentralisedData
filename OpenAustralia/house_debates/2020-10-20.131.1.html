        Diwali is a festival that celebrates the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance and hope over despair. This year it is celebrated on Saturday 14 November. It also marks the beginning of the Hindu new year. Known as the

        , Diwali sees homes filled with diyas and children playing with sparklers. It is one of India's, and increasingly Australia's, most beloved and vibrant festivals. Families and friends come together, share meals, exchange gifts and feast in each other's homes, which are decorated vibrantly to celebrate the joy that this time in the calendar brings. This year, perhaps more than any other that I can remember, we desperately need the message of Diwali, a message that stretches beyond religions and cultures and I know resonates with all Australians. That message is the reaffirmation of hope and the celebration of joy.

        Diwali is a time to reflect on what we uphold as important. On that score it is important for us to reflect on the relationship between Australia and India at this time, a relationship that is growing, is blooming and is really something to celebrate. This year at the virtual leaders summit Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Modi signed a comprehensive strategic partnership, taking the relationship with India to a whole new level and bringing India to the forefront of those important strategic relationships that Australia has. When I reflect on the bridge between the two countries, I think of the 700,000 strong Indian diaspora here in Australia—6½ thousand of whom are in my own electorate.

        This year, while it has had many challenges, it's brought out the best in us, and the best in us has often been demonstrated by the Indian community. I've seen many in our Indian community going out of their way to help their neighbours—helping with shopping, opening their homes as refuge and leaving cooked meals at the doors of family and friends. Earlier this year during the bushfire crisis, many Indian Australians travelled from their homes to bushfire affected areas. Some of those worked in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">

        as volunteers. Many other Indians of every creed provided food and support to volunteers and to people affected by the bushfires. That same kindness is my experience of Indians generally. When we've needed Indian Australians most, they've been there to assist.

        I love attending our local Diwali celebrations, but many of them won't be taking place this year or won't be taking place in the same format. I usually go to the Hindu Council, the India Club, the Diwali Milan, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS" rel="nofollow">

        Temple at Rosehill and the Turramurra Gurudwara. Some of those will be on, but many of them won't be. But the spirit of Diwali and those messages of the triumph of hope over despair, knowledge over ignorance, light over darkness and good over evil are still messages that need to resound for us in this particular year. Let me take this opportunity to wish everyone in the Indian community shubh Diwali—a very happy Diwali.
