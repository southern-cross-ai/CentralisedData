        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is working with strategic partners to secure our region and safeguard Australia's economic recovery and future prosperity?

         thank the member for Curtin for her question and acknowledge and thank her for her advocacy for Western Australia's defence industry in particular and her support for the ADF in the seat of Curtin.

         has a very, very proud history, and the men and women that sign up do so for one reason and one reason alone: to serve our nation so that they can keep Australia safe and secure. Our message to the ADF is: the Morrison government has your back. We are investing $270 billion in our defence capabilities over the next decade to create a stronger Defence Force but also to forge stronger relationships with our regional partners. Over the past several weeks there's been quite the hive of activity in parts of Queensland and indeed around the country, where we've seen 17,000 military personnel from seven nations who have joined with our Australian troops in this year's

         . Around 8,300 Australian military personnel joined in the exercise, and they proved without a doubt that they are the most well-trained and well-equipped force in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Making history, this year's Talisman Sabre also marked the first time that Australian,

         </a>
         forces have joined together and worked together from one ship. This demonstrates a level of cooperation that takes years and years to build and perfect but just highlights the depth of our strategic partnerships. I'd like to thank all those who were involved in this year's very successful Exercise Talisman Sabre.

         Our government continues to create stronger partnerships with our Pacific partners as well. I was reminded just how important these relationships are when I had the honour to formally hand over the latest of the Pacific patrol boats to Vanuatu on Friday in Perth. Despite a very cold and windy day down at Henderson, it really was a joyous eventâ€”as they always are, when we join with our Pacific friends and family. I was particularly impressed when we were joined by the local Vanuatu band in Perth, who'd written a song for the occasion. It was very joyous indeed, as was the impromptu hymn performed by the Vanuatu crew. I must also mention the beautifully dressed local Vanuatu women, who were thrilled to be there, and I'm so glad they could join us.
        </p>
        <p>
         But there is a serious side to this event. It's worth remembering that we are delivering to Vanuatu and our other Pacific neighbours the defence capability they need in order to protect their shores for a safer region, and we're building 21 Pacific patrol boats. This is part of our plan for a secure region. A secure Pacific is indeed a secure Australia.
