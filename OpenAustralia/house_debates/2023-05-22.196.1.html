       <p>
        I want to speak about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appin_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Appin Road
        </a>
        . Appin Road is an essential link in my electorate that connects my electorate of Macarthur in the Illawarra to Wollondilly, Camden and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        airport. Appin Road is a single-lane road each way that carries massive traffic now. Areas of my electorate have doubled or nearly tripled in size since the 2016 census. We are now the biggest electorate by population in the country, yet the needs of my electorate are being ignored by governments of all persuasions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would not be treating my constituents appropriately if I didn't raise this issue in federal parliament yet again. Appin Road is a road on which many people have died over the last 20 years. It has increasing traffic, with trucks from Wollongong port carrying cars, produce and coal moving along Appin Road. The road itself is very dangerous, yet it is not being treated appropriately by governments of all persuasions. It is vital for my electorate. It connects us to the Illawarra. It connects us to the north and to the Western Sydney airport and yet its needs are being ignored. The needs of my constituents are being ignored. It is urgent that infrastructure is put in place for Macarthur. Appin Road is a primary connector for all those areas and electorates in south-western Sydney, leading down to the Illawarra, and yet it is being ignored. This is a tragedy for the electorate of Macarthur.
