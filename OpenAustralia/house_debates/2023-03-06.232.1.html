       <p>
        Australia is emerging from a dark period for the arts. For two years, the pandemic separated audiences from the creative experiences that are so connected to our wellbeing, our connection to each other and our understanding of ourselves. Theatres and galleries fell silent, choirs couldn't sing, kids couldn't dance, school plays were banned and festivals were cancelled. But we gobbled up film and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        , put art on our walls and read to get us through. That difficult period reminded Australians how much art of all types matters to our lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cultural sector faced this storm in a more vulnerable position than it should have been in. The arts community had suffered from a decade of funding cuts. The infamous Brandis cuts devastated the small to medium arts sector. These small organisations are essential to the arts ecosystem, but they were abandoned by the previous government. Many organisations simply didn't survive. The previous government could never quite acknowledge that arts jobs are real jobs. When COVID hit, the government had to be dragged to support artists when they so desperately needed help. The Liberals' belated response, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISE" rel="nofollow">
         RISE
        </a>
        Fund, had no vision or strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government takes a very different approach. We've listened to the arts community. The Minister for the Arts and I, alongside the Office for the Arts, have travelled the country, holding 14 roundtable meetings to listen to ideas, concerns, insights and aspirations. We received more than 1,200 submissions and had countless one-on-one conversations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our new National Cultural Policy, Revive, is based on the knowledge and expertise of people from right across the nation. Revive turns the page. This government will respect, support and uplift the horizons of the arts community. Unlike the previous government, we believe that artists, not politicians, should make decisions about artistic merit. That's why we're investing in the agency that makes funding decisions at arm's length from government. We're reversing the brutal Brandis cuts and providing $199 million to the Australia Council. This means more support across all art forms, including to underfunded areas like youth arts, small to medium organisations and independent artists.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australia Council will be strengthened, modernised and given an expanded mandate. Its transformation into Creative Australia will be the most significant reform in its history. It'll have four new bodies. One will be the Centre for Arts and Entertainment Workplaces, which will provide advice on issues of pay, safety and welfare in the arts and entertainment sectors. It'll refer matters of workplace concern to relevant authorities and develop codes of conduct. It will address issues raised in the
        <i>
         Raising their voices
        </i>
        report, which detailed shocking levels of harassment, sexism and prejudice in arts workplaces. Another body, Music Australia, will support the music industry to grow through strategic initiatives, industry partnerships, research, skills development and export promotion. We'll have a First Nations body to give First Nations people autonomy over arts decisions and investments. Writers Australia will provide direct support to the literature sector for writers and publishers to grow local and international audiences for Australian books.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are all significant steps forward, but, on top of this, we'll introduce quotas for Australian content for digital streaming platforms. We'll almost double investment in the Regional Arts Fund. We'll develop an arts and disability plan to enable people with disability to access and participate fully in the cultural and creative life of our nation. We'll provide $12 million to support digital games developers and independent games studios. We'll legislate to ban fake First Nations art and provide $3.8 million to digitise at-risk First Nations cultural material so it's preserved for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We'll introduce digital lending rights for writers and establish the role of poet laureate for Australia. We'll share the works of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         National Gallery
        </a>
        collection with regional and suburban galleriesâ€”and I know, having been in country
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in the last few days, that conversations about that are already starting. We'll establish artist residencies to visit Australian World Heritage sites to produce artworks and tell stories of place and heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        So how are arts workers feeling? As one said, 'I didn't realise how demoralising it had been until this light came through.'

           connection to kanamaluka, our local estuary, has been explored at the newly built University of Tasmania Library at Inveresk, which I opened last year. Launceston-born and -raised Aboriginal artist Caleb Mansell was commissioned to design feature carpets for the building's interior. A proud and deep connection to country and culture drove the inspiration for the final pieces, which can be seen across the three levels of the new library. The pieces are titled

           Growing up in Launceston, I spent a lot of time exploring and connecting to Country. There was always something mystical about this water that drew me in, it was like an energy. It was important that I brought kanamaluka from outside into the campus and told the story of how it supported our old people and still connects and supports our community today.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is critical that we ensure that the culture and historical significance of our First Nations people, like Aunty Patsy and Caleb, is heard through art. I welcome one of the key pillars of this new cultural policy, Revive, which has a focus on recognising and representing the crucial place of First Nations stories at the heart of our arts and culture and, importantly, legislating to ban fake First Nations art.

Of course, later this year Junction Arts Festival will be backâ€”no doubt bigger and better than everâ€”while, across the region, smaller cultural, writing and poetry festivals and events are held throughout the year, giving dancers, actors, singers, writers, photographers, painters and creators a platform for their work to be performed or displayed.

          <p>
           Over the past decade, a significant number of organisations and individual artists in my electorate of Bass have been supported through coalition funding to bring their creative pursuits to life. When the pandemic was in its height and Tasmanian borders remained shut, I saw firsthand, from my continuing engagement with the local arts community, how the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISE" rel="nofollow">
            RISE
           </a>
           fund gave local performers, pubs, theatre groups and art galleries a chance to get back on their feet and survive at a time when the industry had come to a complete standstill. Given where we were just a few years ago, I am absolutely full of pride when I look at the calendar of arts events in the year ahead and see how our local arts industry is thriving, assisted largely by the community, who have come out in droves to support local shows and artists.
          </p>
          <p>
           Art in all its forms is a reflection on our society and its culture. It is a source of inspiration and connection for our communities. I'm proud of the creative output that continues to grow in my electorate of Bass and want to thank all artists who contribute to our local arts scene. I'm hopeful that the establishment of Creative Australia and four new bodies within itâ€”
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Music Australia
           </a>
           , Writers Australia, a First Nations led body and a Centre for Arts and Entertainment Workplacesâ€”will amplify opportunities for local artists in my region.

            The new National Cultural Policy presents a much-needed boost to our arts industry. It promises a revival to the community of creative Australians and brings with it, for the first time in a very long time, government direction. This cultural policy is the third of its kind, following Paul Keating's Creative Nation and Julia Gillard's Creative Australia. It's a proud Labor legacy, and I'm proud to be of a government that is continuing it.

            We have an amazing arts sector in Dunkley. For example, last Saturday night it was on display in a magical way. The fourth Stellar Short Film Festival was held at McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery. You couldn't find a more beautiful venueâ€”outside amongst the sculptures, the gum trees and the stars and with local food vans and refreshments. That spirited lot gets a big shout-out; it was just amazing. It's one of those events where, after you've been once, you can't stop coming back. It's everything that is great, innovative and inspiring about Australian cinematic culture. It's one of a kind in our country, and it's run by, created by and is the heart and soul of Dunkley locals. There were about a thousand people there on Saturday night, enjoying film and, as I said, food and beverages from locals. Many people went with their family and friends, and we had artists from all the sectors that are involved in making film from around the country.

            Twelve of the best award-winning Australian films from 2020 to 2022 were showcased and competed for prizes from a panel of film judges. They were so impressive:

            I want to make special mention of one of the films from the night.
            <i>
             Tarneit
            </i>
            , directed by John Sheedy, won an award on Saturday night. I have to sayâ€”sorry, everyone elseâ€”it was my favourite. It's a beautiful film which tells the story of Tyrone and Clinton living in Tarneit, in Melbourne. They are deeply bonded, teenage young men. They were deeply bonded partly because they were both deaf, partly through a shared sense of neglect and the hardships of life and mostly because they shared a dream of one day escaping that harsh violence that swirled around them. The film was particularly special as the actors are deaf, and we were able to, with the organisers of Stellar, make sure they could attend the event, receive awards on the film's behalf on the night and be genuinely and absolutely included because the organisers of Stellar arranged for Auslan interpretersâ€”I must say, at significant expenseâ€”to be there to make sure that the brilliant young actors could be part of this event in a full and heartfelt way.

            and the surrounds are full of visual artists, museums, writers, content creators and more. I've spoken of many of them over the last four years in this parliament. These are people who went out of their way to contribute, prior to the last election, to shaping our national arts policy, being part of a forum online with the arts minister, the then shadow minister, to share their experiences, their ideas and their encouragement to move forward with a comprehensive policy. Now that we've launched Revive, the cultural policy my community were looking for, I'm very excited that in a few weeks the now arts minister is coming back to Dunkley to catch up again with many of these local voices, to talk about where to from here.

             I rise today to speak in favour of this motion and also to commend the long-term work of the members for Macquarie and Watson. The Albanese government has launched
             <i>

             </i>
             , Australia's new national cultural policy that will set the course for Australia's arts, entertainment and cultural sector for the next five years. This government recognises the importance this sector plays in Australia's cultural advancement and that the arts shouldn't be a privilege that only a few can access. It's something all Australians can experience and participate in.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the peak of the pandemic, the arts sector worked overtime with little federal support to ensure Australians could still engage with all aspects of the sector, from our cultural institutions and our learned societies to our favourite indi artists. The industry was forced to completely change its ways. Our favourite musicians, artists, comedians and actors went to podcasts, Zoom concerts or other mediums to ensure they could provide sought-after content for their dedicated followers. There are many Australians that are incredibly grateful for the services the arts sector continued to provide during such difficult circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
             The former government were no friends to those interested in the arts or those who worked across the sector. The Brandis era cuts devastated the industry and left many industry participants without hope. But now, thanks to the Albanese government, small to medium-sized organisations will have the opportunity to grow again. Revive will also seek to modernise how the government supports the arts sector.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since its creation by the Whitlam government in 1975, the

              Australia Council
             </a>
             has been the principal Commonwealth body that has supported the arts sector. The Albanese government will now restore its funding and modernise the program by establishing Creative Australia and creating four new bodies:
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Music Australia
             </a>

              First Nations
             </a>
             First and a Centre for Arts and Entertainment Workplaces. Revive will bring much-needed direction to the industry that was largely forgotten during the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments.
            </p>
            <p>
             This government recognises that you should not need to travel to the centre of our capital cities to appreciate art and that tourists should be encouraged to visit our regions to appreciate their stories and cultural contributions to Australia. This policy will begin the process of restoring the cuts made under the previous government and increase funding for the Regional Arts Fund, which will increase its capacity to deliver more regional programs. Revive, in this space, will aim to share the national collections with all Australians, by establishing a loan program that will deliver long-term loans of works from the

             of Australia's collection to regional and suburban cultural institutions, and I look forward to some of the potential programs that might run through the

             in my seat of Bean.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our national collecting institutions have provided Australians, whether they are academic researchers, amateur family historians or visitors, with a crucial link not just to our national heritage but also to an understanding of both our past and present. While Revive doesn't directly address the crippling neglect from the Liberal-National government's decade-long cultural war, I will continue to work with the Minister for the Arts and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Envoy" rel="nofollow">
              Special Envoy
             </a>
             for the Arts to ensure that the long-term financial sustainability of our national collecting institutions can be addressed in the upcoming budget process.
            </p>
            <p>
             We owe Australians a policy that will help shape and grow this nation's ability to share its stories through cultural expression. When I first served in this great place, I had the privilege to be involved in the inquiry into Canberra's national institutions and the report that came out of that inquiry,
             <i>
              Telling
             </i>
             <i>

              hy it's important
             </i>
             . Many of that report's recommendations have remained on the shelf gathering dust. Finally we have a government that is not only committed to our national cultural institutions but is committed to a national cultural policy that will tell our stories, past, present and future. I commend the motion to the House.
