        On a fateful day in December 2003, a

        boy set out from his home to catch a bus to the shops in order to buy Christmas presents for his family. He was a son, a brother, a grandson, a cousin, a nephew and a friend, and at the age of just 13 he had his whole life ahead of him. Today, everybody has heard of

        and the foundation that bears his name. The foundation has many friends but at its heart are Daniel's parents, Bruce and Denise, supported by a small and loyal team who are working in Daniel's name to promote child safety in our schools and communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, 28 October is the annual Day for Daniel. I hope it is a date that everyone remembers, because it is a chance to stand with Bruce and Denise and more than one million Australians in wearing red and supporting the work of the foundation. Bruce and Denise Morcombe are everyday people who are an inspiration to us all. Their strength and dogged determination to ensure only goodness comes from their son's loss has transformed child safety initiatives in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a parent, I cannot imagine how it must feel to lose a child, especially in such devastating circumstances. Daniel was lost to Bruce, Denise and their family, but their loss was also felt by the broader Sunshine Coast community.
