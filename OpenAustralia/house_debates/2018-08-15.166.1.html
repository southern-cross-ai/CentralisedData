       <p>
        One of our most important and valued national institutions is the ABC. We in the Labor Party are committed to properly funding and supporting the ABC so that it can continue to provide much-needed services right across the nation and especially in our rural and regional areas. The Prime Minister and the members of the Liberal and National parties have launched the largest attack on the independence of the ABC in a generation. Since 2014 this government has cut millions in funding to the ABC, which has seen 800 jobs slashed and a shameful drop in Australian content and services. This is all despite the government's now-broken election promise 'no cuts to the ABC'. We all remember that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year alone, this out-of-touch government has cut $83.7 million from the

        </a>
        funding. Our community has had enough. The fact is 17 million Australians consume some form of ABC content every week. In regional Australia, in particular, the ABC plays a vital role in keeping communities connected with local news and emergency information. In my area, in northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , our local ABC plays a unique role in providing local news, community information and relevant emergency informationâ€”for example, last year during our devastating floods many locals turned to the ABC to get critical messages and safety updates related to the flood.

        is part of our national fabric. That's why Labor will stand up for the ABC and fight against this government's ideological attack against our public broadcaster. A Shorten Labor government will reverse the Turnbull government's unfair $83.7 million cut to the ABC. This investment demonstrates Labor's commitment to the ABC's independence and to maintaining the ABC as our comprehensive national broadcaster. The unique programs and services of the ABC should be maintained to provide diversity and insight. One of my local constituents, and highly regarded member of

I totally agree with Neville, and I stand with him and the community in supporting the diversity and integrity of the ABC. Labor believe that the ABC is one of the most important institutions in our democracy, and we will protect our public broadcaster because we put people and the services they rely on first. In contrast, the Liberals and Nationals only look after big business and the banks. Their priority is a $17 billion tax handout to the big banks. The fact is the only way to save the ABC is to change the government and elect a Shorten Labor government.
