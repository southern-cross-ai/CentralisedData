        My question is to the Prime Minister. The government has lost 11 ministers in the last six months, and there is another minister still sitting here who should go. Given that it has been one year and two days since the member for Warringah famously said, 'Good government starts today,' Prime Minister, when does good government start for you?

          Today, we have had some really beautiful speeches, from

           Warren Truss

           Andrew Robb
          </a>
          , and we have had a lot of very warm words said about the National Party. The member for Hunter was just talking about 'Black Jack' McEwen, and it reminded me of something that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           John McEwen

            that the government is transforming the Australian economy to one that will be driven by technology and by innovation, building the prosperity and the security of the 21st century. We have established now four massive free trade agreements. The Minister for Trade and Investment,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robb" rel="nofollow">
             Andrew Robb
            </a>
            , who spoke earlier today so well, has succeeded in putting those building blocks in place. Right around Australia, we are seeing an economy that had been perceived as being largely dominated by the mining-construction boom. Because of the diversity of the economy—because of its resilience, because of the opportunities this government is providing to Australian businesses and individuals right around the country—we are seeing confidence up, unemployment coming down and participation going up. We are seeing signs of strong growth.
           </p>
           <p>
            And so I say to the honourable member, who always wants to cast everything in a bleak light—and obviously gets his questions from one of the more sarcastic newspaper columns—there are plenty of challenges, but the biggest news today is the resilience of the Australian economy and the leadership the government is giving, and the proof is to be found in jobs and investment right across Australia.

             Before I call the member for Petrie, a number of times during question time this week I have made the point that, if members have continually interjected and have been warned multiple times, they do not start with a clean slate. Those who have been warned multiple times I am not going to continue to warn. I am not going to go through the very long list of who they all are, but I certainly will not be allowing them to remain in the chamber—and I do not want there to be any confusion on that point.

             I have also made the point that it is highly disorderly to interject when I am making a ruling, so the member for Moreton can leave under standing order 94(a).
