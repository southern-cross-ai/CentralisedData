       <p>
        As an elected member of the 47th Parliament, I have the honour and the privilege of representing the constituents of Tangney. It is a position that I do not take for granted. As a community-minded man, I always approach situations calmly, knowing that it is often not the loudest voice that is the most impactful but the one who observes, plans and responds with reason and facts. I know that our government—the Albanese Labor government—is one that really listens to the pulse of the nation and responds accordingly to the genuine needs of all Australians. We are in government not to play politics; we are here to make a positive impact on the lives of everyday working people. Considering the pressing cost-of-living crisis that has gripped our country, I'm proud of Labor's tax cut initiatives. It is a balanced approach that is not just about benefiting some but creating relief for all. Many of my constituents have reached out regarding the tax cut from both perspectives: for and against. The feedback that I have received after people have looked into what the government tax cut means for the majority has been overwhelmingly positive. No-one is worse off, and equity has truly prevailed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will share with you some of the feedback that I received from my constituents. One said: 'I stood to benefit from the original stage 3 tax cuts but my three adult children would not, so I agree this decision has been very welcome, and our family love it.' Another said: 'The economic circumstances are now very different than when the tax cut was legislated, so this decision that the government has made is both fiscally responsible and principled.' Another said: 'The Australian public overwhelmingly wants what is best for their community and will forgive a "broken promise" when it is for the right reasons. This is definitely the right reason.' And another said: 'Any tax reform should focus on supporting the lowest-paid and most vulnerable members of our community. Thank you for making the right decision for Australia!'
       </p>
       <p>
        Tangney is a talented electorate that encompasses the values of hard work and perseverance. We do so because we want the best for ourselves and our families. From those employed in skilled trades to white-collar professionals, from teachers to higher education students who have just started their first job, every person is working towards a better future. Our government understands this and knows that the challenges faced by everyday, hardworking Australians have increased and that everyone deserves a helping hand. These tax cuts will do just that. These decisions will foster an environment where prosperity is shared by all. It is not just lip service when we as a government say that we will deliver for all Australians. We are a government that is dedicated to building a society where opportunities are accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status. We are a government that leads with empathy and understanding and commitment to the wellbeing of all Australian citizens. May this tax cut be a testament to our vision of a fair and inclusive nation, and may the benefits of economic growth continue to be distributed equally as well as equitably for all Australians.
