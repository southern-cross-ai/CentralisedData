       <p>
        Earlier this month, I had the privilege of celebrating the 23-year tenure of Leesa Jeffcoat AM as Diocesan Director Catholic Education Rockhampton. After more than two decades, Leesa made the decision to retire. Over the course of her impressive career, Leesa has overseen the opening of 10 kindergartens, four primary schools and a secondary school. More than 75,000 students have gone through the schools which Lisa has overseen during her time as diocesan director.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leesa has served the education system in Rockhampton not only as a director but as a teacher and student of faith. I have always admired those dedicated to our community through the nurturing of our region's young people. Leesa stated that she doesn't see this as an end point in her professional career, but rather that it signals the start of a new direction in her life which is full of exciting possibilities. Leesa has received a plethora of congratulations from many of her colleagues in the Catholic education system, including Bishop Michael McCarthy. The bishop thanked Leesa for her leadership, a skill which she has used well to nurture the youth of our area through faith based care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I enjoyed speaking with Leesa at her farewell and celebrating her championing of students in rural and remote areas. One of our greatest inequalities in this nation is geography. It's important we support the education of rural and regional kids who don't get the same opportunities as those in urban areas. I congratulate Leesa Jeffcoat on her service to Catholic Education Rockhampton and I wish her well for the future.
