        Today I want to pay tribute to Reverend Frank Duffy of Corlette from my electorate of Paterson, who was awarded the Order of Australia medal in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours list this week. Reverend Duffy is a deacon of the Anglican church and was recognised for his work with veterans and their families. Reverend Duffy sees his role as a deacon as providing a link between the church and our community. He was ordained in 2007, and much of his ministry has been supporting veterans and their families—but this was a job he was doing long before that. Reverend Duffy has been a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        for 30 years and is the second of four generations in his family to serve in our forces. His father served in

        , and Reverend Duffy himself carried out compulsory national service from 1957, which saw him complete military training to be 'at the ready' should conflict break out. His son and his grandson are now serving in our Navy.

        Reverend Duffy joined the RSL in 1987 while living in Penrith. He became a welfare officer and began visiting veterans when he lived in

        </a>
        . Reverend Duffy is part of the Nelson Bay RSL sub-Branch welfare team, who visit 100 or so veterans in their homes, hostels and hospitals to check on their welfare. It is often only for a chat, but it makes the world of difference to these veterans. Reverend Duffy is also the welfare chaplain for the Nelson Bay RSL sub-Branch and the

        I would also like to pay tribute today to a group of Maitland people who were, yesterday, inducted into the Maitland City Hall of Fame. The hall of fame was started last year by the

        . Recipients were also recognised in the arts, academia and public service. Yesterday's recipients were swimming champion Councillor Henry Meskauskas; internationally-renowned artist Nell; distinguished engineer and academic Sue McNeil; respected educator Janette Grossmann—and I welcomed some students from Maitland Grossmann this morning—Dr John Fraser and John Robert Hinder; William S Pender, hardware merchant and expert beekeeper; rugby league greats Bandy Adams, John 'Whacka' Graves,
