        The Ballina Seagulls rugby league team have just won their third premiership in a row. I was there last Sunday. It was a great game, a great effort. They were far too quick for their opposition. I acknowledge the players, Zac Beecher, Jayden Coldwell Jackey, Michael Dwayne,

There was a big crowd there last weekend. The team won very, very easily in the end. I just want to make a special mention of Zac Beecher and Nick Meaney, who are friends of my son. They are both only 18 years old and have played in their second premiership, so well done, guys.
