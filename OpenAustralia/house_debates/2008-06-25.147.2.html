       <p>
        On indulgence, I commence by thanking the House for the opportunity to have statements made in this place today and to thank those other members today who will be making statements on the death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
         Jane McGrath
        </a>
        AM. Today the sun is shining outside, but it is a day when, frankly, it should be dark; there should be clouds; there should be rain. The fact that the sun is shining today is indicative of the warmth and the spirit that Jane McGrath reflected to her family, to her community—of which I am a member—to Australia and to the world through her relationship with her husband, Glenn, and in her own right as a truly unique individual. It is fitting that we pay tribute to someone like Jane McGrath. I commend the words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on Monday. On that same day I was pleased, on indulgence, to be able to make some comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        In today’s proceedings I thought I would reflect more on the statements made by other Australians. I want to begin by reading part of an article written by Brad Forrest in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_and_Sutherland_Shire_Leader" rel="nofollow">
          St George and Sutherland Shire Leader
         </a>
        </i>
        . For me it really summarised the sudden tragedy of this for us all. I personally did not know Jane; I have met Glenn on a number of occasions around the electorate. They are identities within our community. But I, like all people who did not know Jane or Glenn personally but knew of Glenn and Jane, have been struck by a sense of grief that is quite profound. It happens very rarely in this country. To reflect those views today in this place is a very positive thing to do, as we all go through the process of grieving—none more so than Glenn, James and Holly—with the service now having probably just concluded in Sydney. I am encouraged by the fact that they are surrounded by their family and friends from their community—their home. It must be just an incredibly sad time for them. It is fitting that we identify with them at this time. Brad Forrest’s excellent article on the front page of the

        on Tuesday began:

        He sat his two young children, James and Holly, down in their Cronulla home and told them what they may have suspected—that their mummy was leaving them, but would always be with them in spirit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Sunday, the family was together by her bedside when Jane McGrath slipped away.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Her brave battle against breast cancer, which began 11 years ago, had ended.
       </p>
       <p>
        It goes on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jane’s fighting spirit had endured several operations over many years, with the cancer having spread from her breast to her brain last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …            …            …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Closer to home, the McGrath cricketing “family’’ of Sutherland Cricket Club, closed ranks around the family last year ensuring that few people knew just how far Jane’s condition had deteriorated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She was unable to attend a number of functions, including Sutherland’s tribute night for Glenn last year, where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne" rel="nofollow">
         Shane Warne
        </a>
        was a guest speaker, or when her famous husband was honoured with the naming of the (previously Caringbah Oval) Glenn McGrath Oval.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, quietly, as she faced the last part of her struggle, she was surrounded by friends who sought to protect her privacy and protect her family at that time. Above all, I remember Glenn standing there down at the Caringbah Oval on that day. It was a day of significance for him; none of us was aware of the pain he would have been going through as he knew what was coming.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the House on Monday I made a number of remarks and I want to repeat a few of them. Firstly, we want Glenn, James and Holly to know how deeply our community in the shire feels for them at this time and mourns the loss of their wife and mother, Jane. I am sure, Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, also coming from the shire, you would share in these comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jane was an inspiration to all of us. Her courage and determination were matched only by her compassion and generosity of spirit towards those women and families who faced the same challenges. Jane gave these women and their families, through her own example and her work through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         McGrath Foundation
        </a>
        , that precious commodity we all need when going through life’s most difficult times, and that is hope.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mothers are the great carers and nurturers of our society, as I said on Monday, and in Jane McGrath we have lost a great mother in our community—a mother who cared lovingly and warmly for her children and who did all she possibly could to give them the best chances in life and to allow them to inherit from her a sense of values that will guide them for all of their lives. Above all, Jane was a fighter who fought for the most precious of all things in life—time with our family and friends and those most dear to us. May we continue to be inspired by the way Jane lived her life for her family and others, and may we do the same for those around us. I said on Monday that we need more mothers like Jane McGrath, we need more wives like Jane McGrath, we need more daughters like Jane McGrath, we need more sisters like Jane McGrath and we need more friends like Jane McGrath.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members of the House will know, during the course of this week a condolence book was set up in my office. I have been overwhelmed and encouraged by those members who have come past and shared their thoughts—and not only members have come; other staff of this building have come and just quietly had their moment and signed that book. I just want to take the opportunity to share some of those thoughts that have been reflected by other members. The first is from the member for Paterson, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some people come into our lives and quietly pass by, others leave footprints on our hearts and we are never the same. Jane was one of those people ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Braddon said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Such a beautiful soul and ambassador, you must be so proud of Jane and her immense courage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Hughes said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Resplendent with purpose and commitment to life; resonant with love, honesty and truth to those she loved ... she is a shining light for the rest of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Barker said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We all recognise the hero that Jane was and is for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>

        </a>
        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You can be proud of what Jane has achieved in her life—the women of Australia will never forget her contribution, help and understanding to the plight of so many facing the challenge of breast cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Leader of the Nationals said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jane’s courage and commitment to supporting families living with breast cancer has touched the nation and will be a permanent recognition of a wonderful life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Joyce said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jane’s influence was by reason of her dedication and commitment to others while the fears and pain were her own and yours. We all recognise her effort and thank your family for the time she gave others.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many, many more that I could read from members from both sides of the House and all around this place. One that was particularly touching was from three survivors of breast cancer working in the Parliamentary Library which said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We appreciate Jane’s courage and work for breast cancer awareness.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen an outpouring not only in this book and in this place but right across the country. If you go to websites—and I particularly commend the

        sold today—you find the most touching of tributes. In this place we need to be the voice of those who are not in this place, and today I think it is important to reflect their voices in this tribute. Peter of Sutherland said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I too have someone in family battling this horrible disease &amp; Jane has been an inspirational role model on how to put on a brave face &amp; face head on to fight this disease ... Many of us are touched by her fighting will to live every minute of her wonderful life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter of Ballarat said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of my ABORIGINAL family and friends, I am deeply sorry for the loss of a very Beautiful woman, mother and wife!

        Dorita of no particular suburb said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Shine on, you are the brightest star in heaven today. I am proud to be a woman, you are an inspiration. All the beautiful memories will be forever in your families hearts.

        To Glenn, James and Holly, I never met your brave wife and mother, but over time I have watched her grow and fight the hardest battle no one should have to fight. She was a true inspiration and when I heard the sad news today I was shattered that such a beautiful person could be taken away from her family so early. Jane touched the hearts of so many people she truly was one of the most courageous people I have seen. The love she had for her husband and children was so great to watch. Her sense of humour was something that I always loved in her interviews, she was a trooper until the end and I will never forget her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cathy of Sydney says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Glenn, James and Holly, our deepest sympathy goes out to you and our hearts are breaking for you, my mum suffered from breast cancer at a similar time to Jane’s first episode, I was 6months pregnant with my first daughter, my mum being ‘old school’ never told us how she suffered, my sisters and I read Jane’s book and it gave us an insight into what she had been through, we thank her so much for that, for sharing that with us. Glenn, ‘sorry’ is not enough we are beyond words and cannot imagine your sorrow, our thoughts and prayers are with you all, she will always be your angel looking out for you from heaven and your beautiful children, much love to you all. My mum did tell us how wonderful the breast cancer nurses always were, so I will do my best to continue Jane’s effort to support this course, please everyone do the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to finish with this last one from Tania of Sutherland Shire:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for sharing Jane with all of us. I will continue to donate to the McGrath Foundation and I hope that many others do also. I know that you and your family and friends will continue to keep Jane’s memory alive in your wonderful work at the foundation.

        <p>
         On indulgence, I rise to speak on the passing of a great Australian: breast cancer awareness campaigner
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
          Jane McGrath
         </a>
         . Jane came to Australia after meeting and marrying one of our nation’s greatest cricketers—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
          Glenn McGrath
         </a>
         . Little did we know at that time that Glenn’s fortune in finding the woman of his dreams was also the fortune of thousands of Australia women and their families who were looking for support and inspiration in their fight against breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jane emerged as an important role model in her own right after discovering she had breast cancer. She subsequently embarked upon a campaign of raising not only funds but also awareness of the disease. During a decade-long battle, Jane entered remission a number of times. But in 2003 she was re-diagnosed with breast cancer. She finally succumbed to a secondary brain tumour earlier this week. It is a testament to Jane’s work at the foundation that she leaves a legacy of greater awareness of breast cancer and particularly the need for women of all ages to be conscious of regular self-testing. Women like Jane and the late actress
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Emmett" rel="nofollow">
          Belinda Emmett
         </a>
         helped to explode the myth that breast cancer is a disease that affects only women in middle age. These two women helped to shine a light on the fact that breast cancer does not discriminate on the basis of age, and, as a consequence, younger women afflicted with the disease have found a voice, a community of support and an inspiration that would not have otherwise existed. I think it speaks highly of Jane’s strength that her activism flourished in the face of great personal challenges. Far from giving in to the weight of adversity, Jane devoted her energies to her family and her philanthropic work and it was arguably Jane’s positive outlook that sustained her during her long battle.
        </p>
        <p>
         First diagnosed with breast cancer 11 years ago at the age of 31, Jane saw the need for better support services for women undergoing treatment, particularly in the form of breast care nurses. In 2002 she formed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
          McGrath Foundation
         </a>
         to fill that gap. Through her work in fundraising, the foundation has been able to support four full-time breast care nurses, each employed on three-year contracts. Breast care nurses not only offer sound advice to patients but can also provide that very important emotional support at a time when many people feel most isolated and vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to put on the record in this place my support for the valuable work being done by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
          National Breast Cancer Foundation
         </a>
         , which have been closely associated with the McGrath Foundation. Their successful
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
          Pink Ribbon
         </a>
         campaigns in October each year have been instrumental in making breast cancer a mainstream concern for Australian women and their families—and there is good reason: breast cancer affects one in every eight women and is the leading cause of cancer related deaths among women each year. It is expected that we will see 13,000 new cases in the coming year and, tragically, almost 3,000 of those diagnosed will lose their lives. The message is clear: early detection saves lives. I would encourage all women and their partners to be aware of the signs of breast cancer and the methods of detection. A simple, regular self-test could be the difference between life and death.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to extend my sympathy to Jane’s husband, Glenn, and their two children, James and Holly. I wish them all the best in this time of great loss and suffering. It is worth noting that, even through the trials that Jane faced, Glenn’s international cricket career had always been supported by her. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Jane for all of the sacrifices that she made in sharing Glenn and his talents with this nation and with the international cricketing community.

         Glenn’s determination on the cricket pitch was matched only by his love for Jane, and I know that the thoughts of all Australians are with him and his children at this difficult time. They can be proud, however, of Jane’s legacy and of the high regard in which she was held in Australia for her tireless efforts, something officially recognised by her appointment as a member of the Order of Australia this year. Just as in life, when Jane’s passion broke new ground for breast cancer awareness, so too in her passing she has inspired countless people to offer their support, with more than $200,000 being pledged to the foundation in the two days following her death.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that today Jane’s family and friends will be farewelling her at the Garrison Church at the Rocks, the same place at which Jane and Glenn were married nine years ago. I also acknowledge the Australian cricket team, who have paid tribute to Jane by wearing pink ribbons and using pink grips on their bats during their match against the

         overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jane McGrath was an outstanding Australian and a role model to thousands of women. I pay tribute to her in this place today and extend my deepest sympathy to her family. I look forward to seeing the work of the McGrath Foundation continuing well into the future and the positive legacy of Jane McGrath living on in the assistance and support given to women affected by breast cancer.

           Jane McGrath

          AM. Jane was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996. She was just 31. She fought a secondary cancer in her hip and in 2006 was diagnosed with a brain tumour and sadly passed away on 22 June this year, with her husband, Glenn, and their two children by her side. Along with her husband, Jane founded the

           McGrath Foundation
          </a>
          after first battling breast cancer. The foundation provides breast cancer education and breast cancer nurses for women suffering from the disease. Jane was always determined to leave a legacy, an echo that would last through eternity that one brave woman could make a difference. Jane wrote:

         <p class="italic">
          I was only 31 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I feel very passionate about empowering women under 40 to take control of their health by conducting regular breast checks—early detection saves lives.

          Sue Murray said Jane had always been encouraging of other women with breast cancer. She went further to say:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The role model that she has presented to women right throughout her journey has been inspiring, has been very supportive and very encouraging for all women who go through breast cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Breast cancer unfortunately is the most common invasive cancer amongst Australian women. In 2002, 12,027 Australian women were diagnosed with breast cancer. The incidence of breast cancer in women rose from 80 cases per 100,000 females in 1982 to 117 cases per 100,000 in 2002, an average increase of two per cent per annum. The risk of breast cancer increases with age—24 per cent of breast cancer cases diagnosed in 2002 were women younger than 50 years, 50 per cent were women aged 50 to 69 and 26 per cent were women aged 70 and over. The five-year relative survival rate for Australian women with breast cancer between 1998 and 2002 was 86.6 per cent compared with 70.9 per cent in the preceding five years. So progress is being made, yet there is still so much more to do.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is estimated that there are well over 110,000 women alive today who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous 20 years. To all of you survivors: I salute you and I urge you to press on and embrace life. You inspire us all with your courage and the dignity with which you live. But, sadly, 2,641 women died from breast cancer in Australia in 2005. That is 2,641 too many.
         </p>
         <p>
          Breast cancer survivors need heroes and Jane McGrath was such a hero. Few families are left unscarred by this insidious disease. When my sister-in-law—my brother’s wife, Keren—was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, it impacted on the whole family. Keren was in her early 30s, not unlike Jane, and she had two very small children, yet we watched her courage and determination during six long months of treatment. We watched her fight to live—taking every day as a blessing, treasuring family and friends and in turn being an inspiration to those around her. Fighters like Jane McGrath, indeed like Keren Robert, do that for our nation. They lift our spirits; they remind us that what matters is not what life dishes up to us but what we do with the life that we have been given. Jane’s passing, like the passing of every life due to cancer, is a tragedy. Yet in the midst of pain we look forward to hope and in the midst of anguish we pray that we can continue to find true meaning in life through faith, family and friends. Jane’s passing is a national tragedy, yet it steels our collective resolve in this place to do more—and I know that collectively we will do more.

           On indulgence: death can be cruel. It affects young people and old, it visits us when we least expect it and it sometimes comes to us after many years of battle. There is a saying, ‘The question is not whether we will die but how we live,’ and I believe
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
            Jane McGrath
           </a>
           lived a full life and lived by those words. Never succumbing to cancer throughout her battle, she chose to live her life with determination and strength. She responded to the challenge that cancer flung towards her with selfless courage and she was a true heroine. She was an inspiration to all of us and a source of hope for many. I would like to personally extend my condolences to Glenn and his children, James, eight, and Holly, six. They have lost an extraordinary wife and mother, and we have lost a true champion in our community.

           once famously proclaimed, ‘Every death diminishes us a little.’ Recognising the profound effect Jane McGrath had on all Australians, when we think of her passing last weekend, that really comes to the fore.
          </p>
          <p>
           There would not be a person in this House who has not had someone in their family or a friend suffer from breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the biggest killers of Australian women; more than 2½ thousand Australian women died last year because of it. It has got to be considered a mainstream health issue not just for women but for men also. I call upon Australian men to take a greater role in this regard. Too many of us think this is a women’s issue. It is not. It is a mainstream issue; it is a family values issue. We should think more about it and concentrate more on it, and more money must be spent on cancer research. I would encourage all Australian women, young and old, to self-test. As the father of teenage daughters, this worries me, as it would worry most parents with young girls in their family. I would encourage all Australian women to attend breast screening regularly. It seemed to me, watching Jane McGrath talk on

          <p>
           I would encourage Australians not to dwell on the tragedy; I would encourage Australians to look at her life and see how she lived it. Her life was a testimony to determination and a source of inspiration to us all. Having heard the tributes flow from the member for Cook, I want to really congratulate him on the speech he made the other day in the House and on his speech today. It is a testimony to his integrity and to the compassion he feels in his heart. Many in his electorate also feel for Jane. I am sure she would want all Australian women battling cancer to replicate her strength and to never give up hope. It is very fitting that the Australian test cricketers were wearing pink gloves and pink grips this morning. I got up early to look, and so they were. That is terrific. That is testimony to the affection and love that the Australian cricket team had for Jane.

           secured $12 million from the federal government to help recruit, train and employ 30 breast cancer nurses. Every time we see a nurse involved in breast cancer research we will think of Jane McGrath. She was a highly respected woman; she was held in high esteem in our community not just for her courage, dignity and stoicism but for the contribution she made to our nation. We are better in this country for having Glenn McGrath here, but we are also better for having Jane McGrath come to her adopted country and live and work amongst us.
          </p>

           When the deeds of Jane’s husband, Glenn, on the cricket grounds across the world are remembered, here at home and in the member for Cook’s electorate and in the capital cities, rural communities, byways and beaches of this country, we will think of a woman called Jane. It is a simple name but her contribution was not simple; it was immense. What she meant to Glenn and to her children will not be forgotten. The contribution she has made to breast cancer research and the fight against breast cancer is extraordinary. I say on behalf of my electorate of Blair, in Queensland, to all those women in my electorate who are battling this disease and on behalf of their partners, sons and husbands: never give up hope, and look to Jane McGrath for inspiration.

           <p>
            On indulgence, thank you to all members, particularly the member for Cook, for bringing this before the House. I rise today on behalf of my community in Tasmania and my family to say goodbye to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
             Jane McGrath
            </a>
            following her 11-year battle with breast cancer. Jane was a remarkable woman. Members who have already spoken on the condolence motion today have remarked on her very special qualities, no better demonstrated than in the McGraths’ interview with the ABC’s
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
             Andrew Denton
            </a>
            . What struck me most, apart from the extraordinary relationship between the two wonderful Australians and their love for each other, was her incredible sense of humour and optimism in the face of what she knew to be a very serious illness. She indeed was remarkable. Her courage and determination to fight this deadly disease was outstanding, and her contribution to raising funds for research into its cause will not be forgotten. As my honourable colleague just mentioned, that will mean a great deal to those people who unfortunately may suffer with this in the future and to the educative program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Jane and her husband, Glenn, were appointed members of the Order of Australia for the establishment of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
             McGrath Foundation
            </a>
            , which has raised millions of dollars for the fight against breast cancer. Jane was an incredibly courageous woman. She has inspired very many other women across Australia to fight breast cancer with tenacity and optimism. Madam Deputy Speaker, if I may, I would like to pay tribute to Jane and to share with you the story of other remarkable women in my electorate who have been inspired by Jane and today have conveyed to me their deep sense of thanks to Jane and their condolences to her family; she was an inspiration to them. I would like to share with the member for Cook particularly the nature of what these ladies—and their male supporters as well—have done, as it is very much in the vein of what Jane would have liked.
           </p>
           <p>
            They call themselves the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">

             Bosom Buddies
            </a>
            , which is great—and, indeed, they are bosom buddies. The Circular Head Bosom Buddies comprise 14 inspirational women who all live in the far north-west coast community of Circular Head, which is in my electorate. Each of the women has been touched by breast cancer in some way. Some are survivors; others have seen first-hand the effect that breast cancer has had on a loved one. Tired of feeling helpless in the fight against this debilitating disease—and I know that is something that Jane raised; there is an initial sense of helplessness, but you want to do something about it—these women made the decision to put themselves out there and be proactive in raising funds for research into breast cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people may have decided to hold a raffle in the past or to host  trivia nights, but the Bosom Buddies set their sights much higher and decided to douse themselves in pink and walk from Smithton to Hobart, effectively travelling from one end of Tassie to the other—and it is about 450 kilometres. So the pink ribbon brigade set off. They also set their sights on raising $100,000 to go to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
             National Breast Cancer Foundation
            </a>
            . From 11 to 21 April last year, the Bosom Buddies walked in the fight against breast cancer and it took them 11 days and 11 nights. For a minimum entry fee of $5, supporters were invited to join in any of the sections of the walk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coinciding with the walk, the Bosom Buddies coordinated the mother of all raffles. At every available opportunity they sold tickets—in the sunshine, in the wind and in the rain; you name it. They sold their tickets in street stalls, at the local agricultural shows that they visited along the way and at local sporting events. At each stop along the way, the Bosom Buddies were accommodated free by local businesses, and local newspaper the
            <i>
             Advocate
            </i>
            recorded their journey each day, again highlighting this whole cause. For 11 days and 11 nights, all Tassie stopped to watch, donate and applaud the work of the Bosom Buddies. They also hosted more than 10 other fundraising events in the lead-up to the big walk. These events took a great deal of time and effort to coordinate. On behalf of our community, I thank the Bosom Buddies for their selfless contribution to the fight against breast cancer. To cap it off, they exceeded their $100,000 target, raising $137,000 for the cause. I know that Jane would have been very proud of them for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The financial outcome of this event is, as we all know, only part of it. It was the awareness raised at the same time that I would also like to highlight. I know that was very much part of Jane and Glenn’s message to the Australian community: we have to become aware, we have to become conscious and we have to be mindful. For each place the Bosom Buddies visited, each stopover they had or each person who read about their travels, if one person was prompted to book themselves in for a mammogram or was taught how to conduct checks on their own breasts, just think of how many lives might be saved in Tasmania. Many women are now better educated about the disease than before. A blog on the website of the Bosom Buddies captures the beginning of their walk the best. It reads:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It made all of us feel so proud as we walked down the main street (followed by about 100 supporters and a horse dressed in pink), to the cheers and well wishes of the local business owners, employees and the general public who come out to see us off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of their final day, their blog reads:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It was a very proud moment for us all as we were led ... by the

            .

           <p class="italic">
            Family and friends were at the gardens to welcome us. It was a very emotional moment. A few tears were shed by us all.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the driving forces behind the Bosom Buddies is businesswoman and breast cancer survivor Judy King. On the phone this morning, Judy paid tribute to Jane McGrath. She said that the very unfortunate death of Jane will ultimately help to raise awareness and vital funds for breast cancer research and support and will provide great inspiration to all. I quote from Mrs King:
           </p>
           <p class="moved">
            That’s what Jane McGrath was all about, raising funds and awareness, and that’s what the Bosom Buddies are all about.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, as I mentioned, clearly Jane was a great inspiration. Mrs King says that the walk from Smithton to Hobart has grown into so much more, and one of the unexpected results has been the rise in the awareness that men can also have breast cancer. One of the walkers on the trek across Tasmania, auctioneer Crichton Horton, joined to represent men and to do his bit to raise the profile of that issue. Indeed, I think the incidence of prostate cancer amongst men, particularly in the light of the education and testing program for breast cancer in women, really highlights what is an important health issue in our country, and I think a lot of men have to take note of this as well. We know how serious and deadly cancer is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mrs King says the work of the Bosom Buddies has been ongoing and will continue in October this year when they launch their book about the experience, titled
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walk" rel="nofollow">

             of Life
            </i>
            , which I think is a very apt description. The printing of the book has been sponsored by the National Breast Cancer Foundation and a copy will be given to breast cancer patients. I quote from Mrs King:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Bosom Buddies are still out there working for breast cancer awareness, fighting for more money and care and we will continue to do so.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Bosom Buddies are all about making the difference. When you’ve survived something like breast cancer it changes your whole outlook on life and makes you re-evaluate everything.

            I know that was certainly a message that Jane and Glenn gave in their interview on the Denton program. Why does it take—and unfortunately, in this instance, it was certainly not something they wished—moments of crisis in our lives and in our health for us to appreciate our lives and to look after ourselves and our neighbours and families? I know that Glenn and Jane were absolutely dedicated to encouraging everyone to live their life for the moment, to enjoy it and be positive and to contribute to the wellbeing of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my passing tribute to Jane, and also to Glenn and their young family—for whom it must be very, very difficult—I would also like to recognise and pay tribute to a person whom I regard as one of the bravest and most courageous people I know, and a person who seeks nothing of others except love and gives it in so many more ways than she receives it. That is my sister-in-law, Marianne Langford-Sidebottom, who has suffered from breast cancer and is in a third stage of fighting cancer. She is an extraordinary fighter and a remarkable person. She is still going well and is very positive—sorry; this has just brought it all to me. Her husband, John, and children, Freya, Kendal and Elliott, are a very, very strong family. Marianne was an absolute fitness fanatic and still is. I think this greatly contributed to her ability to fight this, and she continues to fight it. She is a very courageous and determined person; a person with great perseverance. A thing that I thought that Jane McGrath seemed to exhibit—I did not know the McGraths, obviously, but from every time I saw Jane and Glenn—was something that Marianne exhibits also, and that is a tremendous optimism, a positiveness about living and a mindfulness about life and relationships.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marianne is such a person and is very, very courageous. I draw great inspiration from her and John and the family. I think very much of them, and I know that they would be saddened by Jane’s passing, but she too suffered with Marianne. Marianne continues with her battle, but I think we could all draw inspiration from people like Marianne and certainly Jane in our lives. I hope we can do a lot more to support these wonderful people, who certainly inspire me. I offer my condolences to Jane’s family, including Glenn. The member for Cook no doubt will be passing this on, and the parliament’s condolences and best wishes to the family, and I certainly want to pay tribute to Marianne Langford-Sidebottom, who is an absolute battler and an absolute beauty, and her family. Thank you for this opportunity to offer my great condolences.

            <p>
             On indulgence, I want to join with members on both sides of the chamber in adding my voice to the condolences to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
              Jane McGrath
             </a>
             ’s family. There is no doubt that the passing of Jane McGrath has touched the hearts of millions of Australians, and there are a number of reasons for that. One, of course, is the widespread nature of breast cancer itself. There would be few if any families that have not been directly affected by the incidence of breast cancer. But one of the other reasons we are touched by the events surrounding Jane McGrath is the way in which she carried herself. As a public figure of sorts, I have observed her over recent years. She has been inspirational to many, many Australians. I guess for many of us it was the interview with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
              Andrew Denton
             </a>
             that gave us such a wonderful insight into Jane McGrath, her struggle and her personality. You could not help but watch that interview and admire her courage, the effervescent vitality that she clearly displayed, her great love for Glenn and her family and her sense of humour, which also was obvious in that interview.
            </p>
            <p>
             There have been a number of other interviews in which Glenn has been involved that really do give to many of us something of an insight into the way that Jane handled herself in times of great difficulty. She has been a worthy inspiration to so many. The reality is that one in eight women will be diagnosed in Australia with breast cancer. It is a frighteningly high statistic. The good news is that over the last 20 years the survival rate has been improving by an average of about two per cent a year. So, although more people are diagnosed, early intervention and treatment has resulted in a much higher survival rate, and that is a good thing. Clearly, as members of parliament we all have some responsibility to ensure the proper resourcing of research facilities as well as the facilities for remediation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mentioned that very few families would not be touched by the incidence of breast cancer, and in my own family my sister-in-law has confronted breast cancer and has had to deal with that, as have her loving family. Only a month or so ago, I attended the funeral of the mother of a good friend of ours, who passed away from breast cancer. A very good friend of our family is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer with chemotherapy and radiation, and she too is a very vibrant lady with a great deal of vitality. My wife and her circle of friends have got together on a few weekends for bandanna days. Over a glass of wine, they have sat down to provide I think a bit of support to one another and have made their funky bandannas. Going through the treatment usually results in the loss of all body hair, so very often people wear hats, bandannas, scarves and the like. Indeed, bandannas are one of the fundraising activities and symbols for breast cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you see that in your neighbourhood, in your family and in your circle of friends it reminds you of how pervasive this disease is. All of those who have been touched by it—whether they are victims or friends or relatives of victims—look to the experiences of the McGrath family and are inspired by the way they handled themselves during the last few years.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
              Glenn McGrath
             </a>
             is an elite athlete and has had to confront a lot of things in that walk of life. I am sure nothing compared to the challenge that he had to confront when he found that his wife was suffering from a life-threatening illness. We as a nation all shared in observing that. In recent weeks, as Jane’s illness obviously became worse, it focused the minds of many people in Australia. On behalf of—I am sure—all of the people I represent in this parliament, I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to Glenn and the family and our thanks to them for the role models that Jane and the family provided us all. I think that will help us as we grapple with similar circumstances in our own families and in our own circle of friends. I pass on the best wishes of the people of Brisbane to the McGrath family.

             <p>
              I too would like to add some thoughts, on indulgence, by recognising the immense contribution that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
               Jane McGrath
              </a>
              has made to her community, her family and the nation in a larger sense and how profoundly saddened we all are by her untimely passing. I want to thank the member for Cook for his contribution in the House and here in the Main Committee this morning. I know that when he passes on to the McGrath family the condolence book he will pass with it the sympathies and expressions of sadness from both sides of the chamber.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before I came up here for chamber duty, I happened to switch on to
              <i>
               Sky News
              </i>
              , and I saw a beautiful sunny day in Sydney, a blue sky and the Garrison Church where Jane and Glenn apparently married and which today is the sad focus of her untimely death and passing. I was interested, sitting here on duty, to hear the contributions made by my colleagues from both sides, and I could not fail to note that six male colleagues made contributions. I thought about how important that is for this issue because, as others have said, cancer is not something that affects just one person, nor is breast cancer just a woman’s issue. That really shows how, over the last decade in particular, issues of this nature are much more easily aired in public. The battle that women have fought, sometimes on their own, on these issues has probably helped to inspire men to deal more seriously with the range of cancers that afflict them, particularly prostate cancer.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Treasurer has been one of those men at the forefront of raising men’s consciousness of those issues. I want to pay tribute to the men who spoke on indulgence this morning, because I think it sends a very powerful symbol to women that they are not on their own—that men, family members and community members understand that this is an issue that touches probably everyone in one way or another. I reflected, while listening to the debate, on how much progress we have made through the fundraising efforts of organisations like the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
               McGrath Foundation
              </a>
              , other cancer foundations and many voluntary community groups. The research that has been undertaken has helped to prolong the lives of people who are afflicted by this awful illness.
             </p>
             <p>
              The late Paddy George died at 39 from bowel cancer that eventually spread to the liver. My cousin Irene Rathbone died from breast cancer with the same trajectory as Jane’s; however, just in the short period of a decade, we can see that research and treatment has now made it possible for women to survive much longer, even when they are facing a secondary cancer. I never had the honour or privilege of meeting Jane but, in a sense, I think we all felt that we knew her, particularly after the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
               Andrew Denton
              </a>
              interview. What really touched me was her incredible naturalness. Here she was, a woman from England, walking down the street and people were saying g’day to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
               Glenn McGrath
              </a>
              , and she wondered who this man that she was going to marry was.
             </p>
             <p>
              Certainly his fame left Jane very unaffected—to use the words of the member for Brisbane, her ‘effervescent vitality’ shone through. Obviously she was a woman of immense courage, resilience, optimism and good nature. She was a woman of grace and a woman who touched so many people. I think that is why her untimely death has really captured the spirit of so many people across the length and breadth of Australia. There was something very magical about her, which is probably associated with the affinity we have with people who are touched by adversity when we contemplate how they handle that adversity and assist others to do likewise.
             </p>
             <p>
              In that regard, I think of the many women in the Illawarra who are involved in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Network_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Breast Cancer Network Australia
              </a>
              , which is headed by the wonderful cancer nurse Gloria Swift. I want to pay tribute again to the work that Gloria does in our local community. I know that the McGrath Foundation commits a large amount of funding to the promotion of additional cancer nurses. I think I speak on behalf of not just the members of the Breast Cancer Network but all those I represent in the electorate of Throsby in adding my condolences to those already expressed on the untimely passing of Jane McGrath. All who saw the Andrew Denton interview could see that the love between Glenn and Jane was palpable; it was just genuine, warm and loving. No doubt she was a wonderful wife—and no doubt she could not have been a wonderful wife without also being a truly wonderful mother, in that order. It is incredibly sad for James and Holly to be left without their mum; however, I think in time, when they have grown up, they will be able to look back and reflect on the wonderful contribution that Jane McGrath has made to her community, her family and the nation.

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
                 Jane McGrath
                </a>
                . In my short time in this place, this probably has been the most moving of all things that I have seen take place in this and the other chamber. On behalf of my Sutherland shire community, I pass on those thanks to all of your communities for joining in this motion. These things make Australia what it is, with our shared sense of loss at times like these but also our shared sense of humanity and of hope. In doing so—no matter how members wish to take it—I offer my prayers now for Glenn, James and Holly and their family. I just ask that the Lord comfort them at this very difficult time and in the times ahead; however, more than that, I ask that the Lord will strengthen all those who are suffering from breast cancer and that he will strengthen all of their families—that they will take great encouragement and hope from this day. We just pray for God’s blessing on all of them.
