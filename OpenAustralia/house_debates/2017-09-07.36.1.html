       <p>
        I am delighted to rise to pay tribute to a wonderful woman, a Freeman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Bayswater" rel="nofollow">
         City of Bayswater
        </a>
        , a local government in the heart of my electorate, who celebrated her birthday yesterday, the wonderful enigmatic Marlene Robinson. Marlene served as a councillor in the City of Bayswater for 21 consecutive years, representing West Ward, which includes Bayswater, Bedford and a part of Morley. During that time, she was instrumental in enormous positive change, and to detail all of her achievements I would need at least 20 minutes not 90 seconds . She established the city's youth advisory committee, built the area's first skate park, fought incredibly hard for Environment House and the establishment of that wonderful place, and fought incredibly hard for seniors' access and inclusion as well as access and inclusion for the disabled. Marlene was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which progressively worsened her mobility. Whilst it may have slowed her down physically, it never, ever got in the way of her ambition to make her local community a better place to live. Marlene's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS" rel="nofollow">

        eventually played a role in her leaving the council because she could no longer do the marathon doorknocking that she used to do. But, prior to that, she would doorknock religiously and put us all to shame. You cannot keep a wonderful woman like Marlene down. She continues to work in the local community. Her two decades of experience on the council mean her wisdom is sought everywhere. I have no hesitation in thanking Marlene for her service. Above all, happy birthday, Marlene.
