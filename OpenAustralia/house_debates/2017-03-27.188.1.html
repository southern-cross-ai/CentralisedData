       <p>
        Over the weekend, we had two momentous events on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Firstly, the government very proudly announced an agreement with the state government for funding of Queensland roads, worth half a billion dollars. A significant part of that was the upgrade of the M1 north of Mudgeeraba up towards
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Varsity Lakes
        </a>
        , something we announced during the election. Let it be very clear to the House that the Labor Party announced zero for the M1—check the budget papers. I encourage all Gold Coasters to check the budget papers, and you will find Labor left you out to dry. That is what they did. The government announced it, the government has now provided it, and it is up and running.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to announce that, for the commute between Mudgeeraba and Varsity Lakes, two lanes each side will go to three lanes—six lanes in total. The time for the commute will soon grow less. There is also $5 million for the next step between Varsity Lakes and Tugun. Congratulations to the

        team, which does not take the Gold Coast for granted like Labor, but is all about delivering for the

        .

        On a final note, and something that I think we can all agree on in this House, the first ever
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        women's grand final was hosted at Metricon between the Lions and the Crows.

        was proud to step up to the plate with this fantastic venue. Sixteen thousand people attended the game. It was a disappointing loss for the Lions in what was a very tough game, but it was a great outcome for the country.
