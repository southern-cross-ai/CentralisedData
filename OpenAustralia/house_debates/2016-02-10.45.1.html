        I rise on behalf of the people of Canning who have suffered greatly through the historic bushfires that swept through the Peel-Harvey region last month. Many people have lost their businesses, livelihoods and homes in Waroona and Wagerup. We also remember the people of Yarloop and Harvey, who have been very well represented by the member for Forrest, who is also a dairy farmer who came under threat from the flames.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the devastation, our farming community now face the difficult task of rebuilding their lives and businesses. The media and cameras have long gone and I know that many people feel alone and that the task ahead is insurmountable. The blazing heat of the past week is a stark reminder of how difficult it is to be a farmer in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Today I think of people like Helen and Mick Muir, who lost 15 kilometres of fencing, feed, pastures, buildings and their tractor. They, like many farmers in Canning and Forrest, have a tough recovery ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The volunteer spirit is alive and well in Canning. People are caring for their neighbours, without fanfare and in ways unseen. I think of the Pinjarra Rotary Club who, in the past fortnight, gathered 110 volunteers and removed damaged fencing from 10 properties. We have not forgotten our farmers and we will continue to make sure your voice is heard in the months ahead.
