        The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is proposing works to deliver stage 2 of the redevelopment of the National Education Centre for the Great Barrier Reef's Reef HQ Aquarium.

       <p>
        The Department of Home Affairs is proposing fit-out works for new office space at 808 Bourke Street, Melbourne. Home Affairs currently occupies three buildings in the Melbourne central business district and surrounding areas. The leases are due to expire in 2023 with no options to renew. Under its Melbourne precinct strategy, Home Affairs will consolidate the three sites into one new location, allowing for operational efficiencies and reduced property operating costs. The estimated cost of the works is $34.3 million excluding GST. The works must be referred, considered by and reported on to both houses of the parliament by the Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction works are expected to commence in May 2022 and to be completed in February 2023. I commend the motion to the House.

        Services Australia is proposing to undertake fit-out works at new leased premises at 205 North Quay in Brisbane. Services Australia currently occupies nine buildings in the Brisbane area, many of which include fit-outs that are approaching the end of economic life. Services Australia is proposing to consolidate these sites into fit-for-purpose office accommodation at North Quay. The consolidation will provide operational efficiencies and flexibility to meet future business requirements and reduce overall property operating costs. The estimated cost of the works is $89.4 million excluding GST. The works must be referred to, considered by and reported on to both houses of parliament by the Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works and relocations to the new building are expected to be completed by December 2024. I commend the motion to the House.
