       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax reforms are a major component of the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms to revitalise the Australian shipping industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the government's tax reforms is to encourage and support capital investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes made in 1996 by the previous government have meant a lack of investment in Australia's fleet.
       </p>
       <p>
        A consequence of this lack of investment, in addition to the slow decline in the number of registered vessels, is that our ships are getting older.
       </p>
       <p>
        The average age of the Australian fleet now sits at almost 20 years which is around eight years older than the average of those in the world fleet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ironically, this imbalance exists despite Australia being a country that prides itself on the safety and environmental outcomes of our shipping.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to being a brake on improving the productivity of our domestic shipping industry; newer vessels are safer, more energy efficient and better meet the needs of modern shipping.
       </p>
       <p>
        Encouraging new investment is critical if we are to revitalise the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax reforms I am introducing today provide a platform for this investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax reforms comprise two bills:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This bill provides for the issue of certificates after the end of the financial year to companies who meet the requirements of the tax concession regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also provides companies applying for these concessions for the first time the opportunity to obtain a 'notice' during the first year of entry.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will give companies a degree of certainty that their proposed arrangements will meet the requirements of the Shipping Reform (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Incentives" rel="nofollow">
         Tax Incentives
        </a>
        ) Bill 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional requirements will apply to companies accessing the income tax exemption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Companies will need to demonstrate that they have a substantial proportion of commercial, technical or strategic operations as well as crew management based in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Companies will also be required to comply with a mandatory training requirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The details of this training requirement, which are currently being finalised by the Maritime Workforce Development Forum, will be contained in regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        These provisions are aimed at ensuring beneficiaries of this best-in-class tax concessions have a tangible connection to Australia and are committed to building the local maritime industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also provides the power to collect and collate data in relation to these reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Powers to review decisions are also provided for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
