        Today I rise to pay tribute to a worthy benefactor and local business that has jumped in to assist two local charities for cancer patients. The generosity of their gesture needs to be acknowledged, and what better way than by recording the fact in

        ? But, first, I have some background. The two Shoalhaven charities are the committee raising funds to have a linear accelerator installed in the Shoalhaven Hospital to assist

        cancer patients and the Milton cancer outpatients appeal committee, raising funds for an outpatients wing at the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Both these committees have had their fundraising boosted through the generosity of Corban, Nowra, who donated a new car to be used especially to assist the effort. The car will be raffled and the proceeds distributed between the two charities. The car will be drawn at a ball at the end of March or at the beginning of April. The principals of Corban, Nowra, Cameron Blake and Alan Pace, were approached by a number of people seeking a significant donation. But, as Alan Pace explains it, Corban was not prepared to come to the party unless the community benefited. Both Cameron and he came from Sydney, and as he said to me, ‘City people don’t appreciate how well off they are, because country people do it tough.’ So they resolved to assist in this way, and I want to reinforce their generosity by saying that these are the types of businesses I want to support.
       </p>
       <p>
        They were approached by Mrs Betty Berg
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who has done a lot of fundraising locally and who is a well-known local identity. She negotiated with Corban, and they agreed to help. They supported the community by donating a Suzuki vehicle, and all they ask is that the community in turn support them to some degree. You cannot ask for more than that. Their generosity stands as a reminder that local businesses are as much part of the community as are other organisations. They rely on the community for their living, and it is only right that they participate equally as responsible corporate citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corban, Nowra, is to be congratulated on its generosity of spirit and its involvement in the social issues of the Shoalhaven. I would like to lay down a challenge to the other car dealers in town to match what Corban has done: rise to the challenge and help the community that puts money in your pockets. Whilst many of our businesses are very active in fundraising, particularly in local events, there is always more that can be done by both businesses and, in return, the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to also mention that Jim and Niki Kladis of Kladis Winery at Wandandian, just up the road, have donated a 22 carat gold ruby necklace and matching earrings as second prize. I would love to go on and thank everyone who has contributed so far, but that is for another day when both facilities are realised. For now, may I extend on behalf of the Shoalhaven area our utmost gratitude for Corban’s compassionate and generous gesture. These are the types of businesses that are welcome in the Shoalhaven.
