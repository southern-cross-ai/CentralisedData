       <p>
        We are now two weeks into the official dry season, which means the weather is perfect and there is a lot of activity in my electorate of Solomon, including the Mindil and Palmerston markets now opening. My team and I have been involved with Activate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        , a community and health wellbeing program organised by General Practice Network NT and the Darwin and Palmerston city councils. This excellent 10-week program has been running for six years now. As part of the activities on Sunday, I hosted a leaders walk at Palmerston and I thank everyone who came along.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the matter of sport, I would like to acknowledge the great start our local football team, the NT Thunder, have had. Coach Murray Davis and new captain Cameron Ilett have done a great job, and it is no surprise to us that they are currently on top of the ladder, undefeated after six games. I wish them luck this weekend in

        when they play against the Mount Gravatt Vultures.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also delighted to let this House know that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Darwin fishing club have negotiated, secured and relocated to the new clubhouse, an empty RAAF base house at Eaton. On this matter I would like to thank Minister Snowdon who has been true to his word at our meeting that the RAAF base houses will indeed be made available for Territorians. Sadly, though, we still have over 100 houses vacant. I will continue to push this issue, because no-one likes waste and mismanagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arafura_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Arafura Games
        </a>
        are well underway. The competition, held every two years, is a major sporting event targeting developing athletes across the Asia-Pacific. I wish all the athletes well, including competitors from the Oceania Paralympic Championships. It was disappointing and embarrassing for the Territory Henderson government that yesterday our beaches were closed for swimming due to the high levels of E. coli and other bacteria.
