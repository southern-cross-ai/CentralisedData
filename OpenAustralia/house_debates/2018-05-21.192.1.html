       <p>
        This National Volunteer Week, I'd like to give a huge shout out to all of the volunteer groups in my electorate, but particularly to Team Colyton, a phenomenal community group which aims to foster collaborative relationships between residents, businesses and community initiatives in their neighbourhood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their achievements range from connecting active community members via regular activities like walking groups and book clubs through to participation in early years and social inclusion weeks. They also help fight for the improvement of Colyton's public spaces through things like graffiti removal, graffiti murals, public artworks, gardens and more seating space at the shops. Team Colyton also hosts the annual Colyton Carols, a community Christmas celebration with beautiful performances from local school kids, as well as different members of church communities and various other community groups. I'd like to thank all of the groups that have supported Team Colyton throughout the years, including Community Junction, Penrith Neighbourhood Renewal and Ability Links. Team Colyton would not be Team Colyton without all of its members, which include local residents, community services, school groups, businesses and council. I sincerely thank everyone in the group for their tireless hard work and advocacy for our entire community. If you live in Colyton, I strongly urge you to get along to one of their meetings, like I did the other day, and you will even get a fabulous shirt that you can wear with absolute pride while you're out there advocating and improving your local community. Thank you.
