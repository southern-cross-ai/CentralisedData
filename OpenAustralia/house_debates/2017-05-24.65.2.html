        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care. Will the minister update the House on how the budget is providing greater support to older Australians? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Bennelong for his continued interest in aged care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, I want to announce that I have commissioned an external review of the failures and shortcomings that led to the unfortunate circumstances at Makk and McLeay at the Oakden older persons facility. What I want out of that is a report that has no fear or favour in identifying the shortcomings that allowed that context to prevail, because the Turnbull government is committed to a strong, effective aged-care sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         Providing support to our older Australians is a high priority for government, and it was reflected within the 2017 budget. In the forward estimates we have allocated $99.3 billion to provide for the needs of older Australians living within residential care or those who choose to stay at home longer and enjoy the autonomy and independence that they have been used to over their years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recently, I announced a two-year extension of the Commonwealth Home Support Program of $5.5 billion. This provides for community transport, cleaning, personal care, allied health care, domestic assistance with cleaning and shopping, home maintenance and modifications. This means that 900,000 Australians will receive this support, provided and supported by 1,600 providers. An additional $3 million was provided to strengthen the My Aged Care platform. This will enable the enhancements to occur that will make access easier for professionals, for families who have loved ones considering aged care and, importantly, for people in rural and regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is the $2 million development of an industry-led workforce strategy, which will not only link with the needs of aged care but, in working with my colleague, Minister Porter, will also look at needs within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, the government is investing $33 million over three years to help service providers in the disability and aged-care sectors to grow their workforce. It will also harness existing employment services to match local jobs. It is an incredible area of growth but it is also an area in which we want the workforce that is projected for the future. We have a need of 366,000 workers in 2016, which will increase to 980,000 workers in 2050. In addition to that, 60,000 more full-time workers will be required by 2019 as the NDIS rolls out and the connected activity of the aged-care sector workforce complements the NDIS Integrated Market, Sector and Workforce Strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only issue facing the NDIS is Labor's ballooning funding gap of $55 billion over the next decade. Unlike Labor, the Turnbull government will fully fund the NDIS through a 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare levy.
