       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the passing of Viola Hill and give tribute to her contribution to the local community in northern Brisbane. Viola Hill passed away on 18 February 2008. She was a well-respected Aboriginal elder for her time and work within the wider Brisbane community. Viola was born in Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission. Although I do not have time to talk about Viola’s time in Cherbourg, I can say that, as a devoted Christian woman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM" rel="nofollow">
         AIM
        </a>
        Church, Viola eventually became a Sunday school teacher and leader. This led to her missionary work for the church.
       </p>
       <p>
        With her missionary work, Viola relocated to Rode Road, Chermside in the early 1980s with her son, Phillip. Living at Chermside, Viola provided care and accommodation for people who came to the city for medical treatment. During this time Viola had also become affectionately known as Auntie Vi. Living in Chermside she had worked with Auntie Evie Walker, Auntie Nellie O’Chin and Pastor Malcolm and Ada Munro. Together, they visited many Indigenous communities in Queensland and Australia with their missionary work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auntie Vi moved from Rode Road to Deagon where she lived for the past 28 years and continued with her missionary work with Auntie Nellie. Auntie Vi and Auntie Nellie used their own money to regularly visit the prisons, hospitals and schools. Auntie Vi was a surrogate mother to many kids from different backgrounds, especially those she had met in prison. To her they were all equal. Her limited education and communication skills did not stop her hunger for better treatment and living conditions for her people. She lobbied many parliamentarians for years to have equal rights and basic needs implemented into mainstream Australia for Aboriginal and

        </a>
        s. Auntie Vi was a tireless community worker, initiating many community programs and employment opportunities for Indigenous people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another testament to Auntie Vi was that she helped to establish the Koobara Aboriginal cultural organisation at Zillmere, where she was honoured with life membership. Her other involvements were with the Nalingu Respite Centre and as an initial founding member of the Ti Tree Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing program at Sandgate. Through her vision, energy and drive Auntie Vi achieved many goals in her life by negotiating with local councillors and state government departments to help improve services for her community, especially for the Indigenous people in the local community. In 2006, the completion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Street" rel="nofollow">

        units in Sandgate, named in her honour Viola Hill Place, is a testimony to her outstanding work and service in the Sandgate area and beyond. Viola’s contribution and commitment have established networks of services and support for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to pass on my condolences to Auntie Vi’s family and to all those people in communities, not just in Petrie and Lilley but all over Queensland, who are feeling the sadness of Auntie Vi’s passing. Her spirit will forever live on and so will her work.
