        I rise today to share with you a recent remarkable event in my electorate of Leichhardt: the North Queensland space industry workshop presented by Space Centre Australia. This groundbreaking event was held in Cairns on 21 April. It brought together leaders and experts from around the world to discuss the construction of Australia's first large-scale, multiuse spaceport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Space Centre Australia's facility represents a significant investment in the region. It is estimated that some $120 million will be injected into the Far North's economy during the construction phase and an estimated $100 million per annum thereafter. Once operational, the spaceport will create up to 300 permanent jobs and thousands of construction and support jobs throughout its development. It will be a real game changer for

        </a>
        and the broader Australian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The workshop was critical in establishing a common understanding of the space industry sector regionally, nationally and internationally and how it impacts Far North Queensland. It focused on encouraging positive collaboration and cooperation between the community, academia, businesses and government. I'm particularly proud of the strong Indigenous focus and involvement, with leaders like Daniel Joinbee, managing director of Gunggandji Aerospace—a 100 per cent Indigenous owned business—and Sharon Bonython-Ericson, founder of Illuminate

       <p>
        I want to also extend my heartfelt congratulations to James Palmer, the CEO of Space Centre Australia. His team has been instrumental in pioneering the Australian space industry in Far North Queensland. The facility will sport commercial operations, which will include not only launching but also retrieving satellites and also potential defence needs while providing a clear pathway for our next generation to learn on site and gain employment as part of the space industry. The event was a fantastic success, and I'm proud to have been part of this significant moment in our region and in our country.

        say that I'm very much looking forward to working alongside all involved in embracing these new technologies and this innovation. Through close collaboration, I'm sure Far North Queensland will have no problem in reaching for the stars.
