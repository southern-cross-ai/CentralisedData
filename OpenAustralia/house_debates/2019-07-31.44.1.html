        Road congestion is a vice in the major cities and eastern seaboard of Australia, but it is out of control in Queensland, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HILDA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        survey pointed that out yesterday. The ABS tells us that the longest commute in Australia is in Brisbane. We've got a state Labor government too busy building up the bureaucracy, the water bubblers and the public servants to care about it. In my area of Redland, we have an 800-metre stretch of road to be duplicated—that's the legacy of state Labor—and, in the meantime, the other state MP promises an on-ramp to the M1. You need a road that functions to get to the on-ramp. They're beyond understanding the importance of investment in infrastructure in Queensland Labor.

        And, despite the nation's figures getting better, unemployment in Queensland and in my area has gone from 4.4 to 5.8 per cent under the Labor watch. It's out of control in Queensland. Queenslanders have lost patience with Jackie Trad and her troupe. And I want to say one thing very clearly: there are around a thousand Redlanders in my city who are unemployed—they shouldn't be, but they are—because of our state Labor government's inability to deliver in my home state the very good providence of economic management that there is in Canberra. We will stand up against this abrogation of their responsibility. They are building up public servant multistorey high-rise buildings in the city, hoping they will vote for them, but they are forgetting about the locals who just want a job a little closer to home and a road that gets them there.
