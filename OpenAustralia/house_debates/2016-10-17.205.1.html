        At just seven months of age, a little boy in my electorate suffered horrendous abuse at the hands of an adult, an adult who should have been able to be trusted. Bobby, against all the odds, has battled uphill, and his prognosis was never the outcome we have today. Through the love, support and dedication of his mum, Elise; Dad, Baz; and big sister, Olivia, Bobby is making progress each and every day. In Carers Week, I make particular mention of those people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently our amazing community came together for Bobby the Brave's Gala Ball, via the genius of Nicole Galea, Bobby's godmother, to celebrate his achievements and raise much-needed funds for Bobby's family to buy a car that would accommodate his wheelchair, to maintain the family's independence. The initiative of Nicole spurred on another local champion, Greg Bond, to gather his mates and walk from Randwick Children's Hospital, where Bobby received treatment, to Panthers club, raising $14,000 along the way.
       </p>

        The evening was a great fusion of community support, compassion and working together. This is a testament to the community spirit that is very much the fabric of the electorate I proudly represent, Lindsay. I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Nicole and Greg and their wonderful teams for the way in which they have changed this family's life, and to extend to Elise, Barry, Olivia and Bobby all the very best into the future. I look forward to continuing to work with them over the coming years. I would like to add that, since the fundraiser took place, Bobby's family have realised that dream of buying a car and are now able to maintain their independence.
