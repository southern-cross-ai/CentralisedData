       <p>
        Townsville is about to get an influx of visitors, thanks to the half-price flights made possible by our announcement last week. I've been meeting with dozens of tourism, accommodation and hospitality business operators over the last year. They've all said the same thing: this year has been extremely tough. With constantly changing restrictions, the uncertainty has resulted in a big hit to visitation to our area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to admit that I, along with the industry, was disappointed that Townsville was left off the first tourism stimulus list, and so I used the community's voice; I met with them to write to the relevant minister to explain how important this would be to a region that had been devastated through floods and then the impacts of COVID-19. So I was very pleased to be able to make the announcement that we will be getting the 50-per-cent-off flights to Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to encourage everyone who's listening today and everyone here: in the coming months, your electorates are going to be cold and miserable! Not in Townsville: it'll still be 30 degrees; it'll still be lovely. So come visit. Use your 50 per cent discount. Come up to Townsville. For the people of Townsville: it's okay; when they come up and visit and go across to Maggie island, you can use the 50 per cent in reverse and get away for a little break with the family. So, everyone, come visit Townsville. It's a lovely place to visit. It's a great place to be.
