       <p>
        Since 2009 Business Armadale has been helping local business owners reach their full potential by promoting a strong community spirit, providing training and support for local businesses and proactively advocating for the economic success of the wider city of Armadale and City of Gosnells region. Business Armadale has also strongly advocated for key local infrastructure projects that will help drive efficiencies in our area, like the widening of Armadale Road, the construction of a new Armadale Road bridge and the fixing of the Denny Avenue level crossing—projects for which I and Labor have been long-time supporters and advocates.

        Last week, I had Labor's hardworking shadow minister for employment services, workplace participation and the future of work and the digital economy, the member for Chifley, back in my electorate of Burt, attending a Business Armadale post-Budget breakfast round table. We spoke to the local business group about Labor's approach to supporting small business. We had plenty of great questions and engagement not only about our policies but about those of the government. It was great to see their support and receive their ideas about how we can support more jobs growth in my local region—an area that is struggling more than most.

        The thing that impressed me about Business Armadale was that the discussion was not just about them; it was about the wider community and how we can make things better for all people in our communities, their businesses and workers in particular. I would like to thank the president of Business Armadale, Wayne Nurse, and Heather, who organised the event, along with Gary and his team at The Manse Restaurant, who hosted us.
