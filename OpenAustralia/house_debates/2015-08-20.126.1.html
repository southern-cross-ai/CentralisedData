        I have spoken many times in this place about volunteering. Volunteering is a strong Australian tradition. It is so strong, in fact, that it is estimated to be worth more than $200 billion a year. Each year in my local community more than 16,000 men and women give time back through volunteering, and many place their lives at risk to assist others: from surf lifesaving to marine rescue, the Rural Fire Service, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        and the

         Volunteer Rescue Association
        </a>
        . I am sure we are all very grateful for their service to our communities.

        One of the great joys of being a member of parliament is getting the opportunity to meet and support these volunteers and the organisations to which they belong. I was honoured to have recently attended The Lakes Team Volunteer Appreciation Day, where volunteers from Rural Fire Service units across the Wyong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">

        councils are recognised for their hard work, dedication and commitment. It was great to also see the member for Shortland there.

        ' tireless firefighting is the difference between life and death and having lives forever altered by the unforgiving nature of fire. Not only do our RFS volunteers protect us in times of fire but they also play a significant role in times of other natural disasters, including the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        storms, which ravaged the Central Coast in April this year. In fact, it was a particularly poignant ceremony as the volunteers had only recently finished dealing with the April storms. RFS members' contributions are not just measured in the aftermath of natural disaster, they are felt all year round when we know that if we are ever under threat from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">

        I would like to pass on my congratulations to: Mathew Shoesmith, who received a national medal for 22 years of service;
