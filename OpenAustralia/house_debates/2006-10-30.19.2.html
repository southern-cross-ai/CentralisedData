        Bendigo community broadcaster Fresh
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        have been informed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
         ACMA
        </a>
        that, after 25 years of successful broadcasting, their licence would not be renewed simply because the ACMA believed their application was received after the statutory closing period. I believe this ACMA decision is a breathtaking example of arrogance.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_FM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        management have informed me that their application for licence renewal was dispatched on 28 April 2006, well within the prescribed period. I informed Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts Senator Helen Coonan of this in a letter posted on 9 October and to date have not received even an acknowledgement of that letter let alone a reply.
       </p>
       <p>
        ACMA have stated that they believe they have not been supplied with significant evidence that Fresh FMâ€™s application had been sent in April. When Fresh FM re-sent the application they explained to the department that if they needed proof in the form of a stat dec then they were prepared to forward it immediately. Fresh FM have received no correspondence back from the department regarding this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fresh FM received a faxed document on Friday afternoon around 2.40 pm informing them that their licence would not be renewed. This gave the organisation very little time to speak to all of their members, sponsors, supporters and committees. Fresh FM programming provides access to a range of multicultural, minority and other community groups. They would not have access to airtime and therefore communication with their respective communities if Goldfields Community Radio were unable to continue operating.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goldfields Community Radio also provide live sporting coverage, the only radio station in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Central Victoria
        </a>
        to do so. They provide programs specifically for young people, such as programs where school students present music and other information. They have also played a vital role, and been a willing participant in, a range of local charity activities.
