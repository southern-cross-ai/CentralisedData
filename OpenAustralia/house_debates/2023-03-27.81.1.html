        My question is to the Prime Minister. A typical Australian family with a mortgage today is paying $1,700 a month more than when the coalition was in government last year. Power bills are rising sharply, and the cost-of-living is going up and up. Inflation is at its highest level in 30 years. Will this out-of-touch Prime Minister finally admit that families always pay more under Labor?

            about the cost of living, the impact of inflation, and housing and energy policy. Indeed, we had legislation last December about energy policy. We had the cap on gas and on coal—gas here, coal in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            and Queensland. That made a difference in halving the wholesale price that was predicted at the time of the October budget. We also had a $1½ billion energy price relief plan, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition voted against. But we voted in favour of it, and that will be included in the May budget.

            But there is an opportunity for redemption. I always believe that people can redeem themselves. I have that faith. The nuns at

             HIA

            , the Housing Industry Association, said it supported 'the government's goal to build 30,000 social houses and believes it's a worthy goal to get behind'. It said, 'More supply means cheaper rents.' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that that is irrelevant. I actually think it isn't irrelevant at all going forward. Fortunately, some over there—

                The final part of that question—and it has been the final part of a number of questions—goes to particularly asking ministers, or, in this case, Prime Minister, to compare and contrast where you would pay more. That tag specifically invites a comparison with the previous government. That's exactly what it's doing, and the Prime Minister is simply responding to exactly that part of the question.
