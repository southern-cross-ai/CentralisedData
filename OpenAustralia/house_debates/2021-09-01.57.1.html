        [by video link] Over the last week, Australians have been tuning in to watch our incredible Paralympic athletes compete on the world stage in Tokyo. Just like their Olympic counterparts, our Paralympians have been well represented on the podium, reaping over 50 medals in the games so far. I had the pleasure of hearing the stories of two

        , when I caught up with them via Zoom from Tokyo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matt, a veteran of the Paralympic swimming team, was born with cerebral palsy and a vision impairment. He told me with a shrug how he has endured over 50 operations in his lifetime. Matt made his Paralympic debut in Athens, in 2004, making this his fifth consecutive

        he has added a bronze medal and a gold medal to his already impressive collection.

       <p>
        Tiffany became the youngest Australian Paralympic swimmer to compete at the world championships when she participated at the 2015 competition in Glasgow at just 13 years of age. She went on to win a gold and a bronze in Rio in 2016. Already at these games this inspiring young woman has won bronze in the 200-metre individual medley and is on track to defend her 200-metre breaststroke crown, winning her heat in the event just this morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matt, Tiffany and the entire Paralympic team have made their communities and their nation so proud. We are inspired by your efforts and wish you all the best of luck for the rest of the games.
