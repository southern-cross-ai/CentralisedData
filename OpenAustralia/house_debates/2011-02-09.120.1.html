       <p>
        As members of parliament, we often hear of illnesses and medical problems that afflict our constituents. Such moments are reminders to us that there are many people in Australia who, through no fault of their own, are struck down or who have a loved one or friend struck down by health problems. Their circumstances are tragic, and we can understand that the situation can become too much for them and they cannot keep going on. In the case of relatives who require high levels of care after a health problem, many people seek permanent care, but some do not. Some are determined not to succumb to the adversity and the difficulties of providing care to their loved one. Today I will speak of one such person, my constituent Mr Maurie Ellemor.

        , Steve Ellemor, the son of Maurie and Angelina Ellemor, told me that his parents had been married for 40 years. He told me that in July 2008 Lina had brain surgery to remove a small growth at the back of her brain. Although the outlook initially looked positive after the surgery, she needed another operation within 24 hours to deal with the swelling of her brain. It was determined that Lina had suffered a brain stem stroke, and she was in a coma for nine weeks. The prognosis looked bad, and it was suggested that Maurie look for permanent care such as a nursing home. Maurie and Steve determined that they would not give up, and Maurie instead pushed hard for a bed at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenton_Park" rel="nofollow">

        rehab hospital. From November 2008 to September 2010, Lina was there. Although some limited progress has been made, Lina still requires full-time care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maurie is a small business owner and, like so many small business owners, faces fairly significant bank debts. In spite of such challenges, Maurie has left the business in the hands of his son Steve while he modifies the family home and provides care to Lina himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this tragedy occurred, Maurie has had a range of additional challenges to overcome. He endured a home invasion whilst Lina was still in hospital; and late one night, after returning from the hospital, he drove past his business to check on its security only to find a hit-and-run victim lying on the ground outside with a serious head injury. If that man had not been found by Maurie, he certainly would have died that night, with his skull split open.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steve Ellemor and family friend George Rumenos describe Maurie as a patriot who loves the flag and his country. Maurie is the sort of friend who would give the shirt off his own back just to help. They describe him as a great dad and a great husband who at times struggles with the weight of his responsibilities, yet he is clearly defined by his great love for his wife and his determination to do the right thing for her.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the wider community, beyond Cowan, would benefit from hearing the story of Maurieâ€™s inspiring dedication. Today I take this opportunity to honour Maurie Ellemor as a great role model for our community. I hope that in the future there will be better days for Maurie, Lina, with her health problems, and the entire Ellemor family.
