        <p>
         I thank very much the member for Hunter for his question. As a regional Australian, he knows just how important these tax cuts are for those of us who live in the regions. In fact, as the Treasurer just mentioned, 90 per cent of regional taxpayers will be getting a bigger tax cut under the Albanese Labor government's tax plan. That is a very good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 1 July we will be delivering a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer to help with the cost of living, and this will significantly benefit those who live in the regions. In fact, in the Hunter, 73,000 taxpayers will receive an average tax cut of over $1,500.
        </p>
        <p>
         My colleagues and I who live in the regions—we love them—and in remote Australia have been listening to what our communities have been telling us about the cost of living, and we recognise that people are doing it tough. But we're responding to that pressure by delivering a bigger tax cut for middle Australia to help Australians with that cost-of-living pressure, here and now.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach will overwhelmingly support those in the regions. Under this government, with our tax plan, regional Australians will keep more of what they earn. Eighty-six per cent of taxpayers in western
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and the Hunter will get a bigger tax cut under Labor's plan starting on 1 July. Eighty-seven per cent of taxpayers in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Far North Queensland
         </a>
         and regional Victoria will get a bigger tax cut under Labor's plan. The person on an average income of $73,000 will get a tax cut of $1,504—$804 more than they would have been going to receive under the Liberal Party's and the National Party's plan.

            <p>
             As I was saying, those earning $40,000 will get a tax cut of $654—frankly, compared to absolutely nothing under the Liberals and Nationals. These vitally important nurses, teachers, retail assistants—including those important workers who work in Woolworths, that the Leader of the Opposition so righteously wanted to somehow say should be boycotted and, therefore, lose their jobs—and our labourers, our truckies and our agriculture workers in regional Australia are some of the most likely to benefit from that.
            </p>
            <p>
             We recognise the contribution of our workers to our nation and to their communities, providing our food, getting our goods to market, and goods to our doors, supporting a good-quality life in our regions, and increasing the availability of affordable housing. We know that, in Gippsland, 61,000 taxpayers will get a tax cut, including 86 per cent who'll be getting a bigger tax cut. In New England, 62,000 taxpayers are getting a tax cut, including 82 per cent getting a higher tax cut. In Leichhardt, 79,000 taxpayers are getting a tax cut, and 87 per cent getting a bigger tax cut. These tax cuts are good for regional Australians, and it's only a Labor government that's delivering them.
