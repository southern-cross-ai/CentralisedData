       <p>
        This morning I welcome the recent initiatives by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator the Honourable Joe Ludwig, concerning blind and visually impaired electors. I am very pleased that our government yesterday introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Close of Rolls and Other Measures) Bill 2010 providing blind and visually impaired electors the legal option of casting a secret vote. These amendments will ensure that arrangements can be put in place before the next election while longer term solutions are prepared. Importantly, it is part of our government’s response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified in 2008. Under article 29, the convention states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... Parties shall guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to enjoy them on an equal basis with others ...
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004, I first raised my concerns in this place that visually impaired electors did not have the right to cast a vote in secret, and I called on the government and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to investigate this matter and provide the necessary technology and a system that would realise this goal. In 2007, a trial of electronic voting was conducted but in 2009 the electoral matters committee deputy chairman noted that the electronic trial did not increase participation levels enough to make the cost worth while. A secret ballot is a democratic right in Australia and I am pleased that the Special Minister of State has ensured that the Rudd government will provide a means to uphold this principle for our visually impaired citizens and that we continue to work to fulfil our obligation under the United Nations convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Lowe, I am proud to host two wonderful organisations that provide invaluable support and resources for the visually impaired. The head office of

        , have been working tirelessly on the National Disability Strategy, which aims to improve the lives of people with a disability. I commend both the Special Minister of State and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services for their efforts and I look forward to further improvements for the benefit of Australians with a disability, as well as their families and carers.
