        This morning the coalition government announced it is delivering for regional Australia, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a $100 million mobile black spot program. This is really good news for residents and businesses in my electorate of Robertson. We had previously committed to expanding mobile coverage as part of our growth plan for the Central Coast. We did this because we know it will have major economic, social and safety benefits for people who live, work and travel in these communities.

        Unfortunately, under the previous Labor government not one cent was spent on dealing with mobile phone black spots. So today I am pleased to announce that four serious mobile phone black spots will receive better mobile coverage as a result of today’s announcement. Thanks to the mobile black spot program, coverage will be improved in parts of

        Last year I met with locals from Mangrove Mountain, including Glynnis Golsby, who joined me in fighting for better mobile coverage in that area so I was really pleased to be able to tell Glynnis this morning that their community is one of the black spot areas addressed by round 1 of this funding. I am also glad to see that a further $60 million in funding has been announced for round 2. This will be an opportunity to assist more regional locations where there is still strong community demand for improved mobile coverage, especially after the recent storms we experienced on the Central Coast. I commend this program and particularly thank the member for Bradfield for his important work in delivering—(Time expired)
