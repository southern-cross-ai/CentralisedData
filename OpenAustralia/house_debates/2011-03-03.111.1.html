       <p>
        I rise to speak about the matter of Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital, which is the major public hospital in my electorate of Bradfield. For many years, Hornsby hospital has been grievously neglected by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state Labor government. This is a major hospital serving a large part of the northern area of Sydney, but it is in very poor physical condition. I have had the opportunity to visit the hospital on a number of occasions and I have seen for myself the operating theatres which have very inadequate electrical wiring that is not suitable for modern equipment. I have seen for myself the open passageways running between wards and the operating theatres through which patients have to be wheeled at any time of the day or night, no matter how cold it may be.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have seen for myself the evidence of damage from possums and I have seen for myself the poor state of the wards. It is an inadequate physical facility in which the doctors, the nurses and the staff do a terrific job. It is widely accepted that Hornsby hospital needs to be rebuilt but, for 15 years there has been very little good news on this front. I am therefore particularly pleased to be able to congratulate the New South Wales shadow minister for health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jillian_Skinner" rel="nofollow">

        , and the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Hornsby, Matt Kean, on the recent announcement that an incoming O’Farrell government would commit to spending $50 million towards the upgrade of Hornsby hospital. This will not finish the job but it will be a very important start on the project of rebuilding Hornsby hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate and acknowledge Dr Richard Harris, the chair of the medical staff council, and his colleague Dr Pip Middleton, amongst others, who have been advocates for improving the physical condition of Hornsby hospital for many years. For 15 years we have seen a sorry tale of neglect of the needs of Hornsby hospital by the New South Wales state Labor government, but it is very pleasing indeed that there is now a clear commitment by an incoming O’Farrell government to spend $50 million to improve Hornsby hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am particularly pleased to note the words of the shadow minister for health, Jillian Skinner, that this would be part of a staged redevelopment. Let me congratulate the Liberal candidate for Hornsby, Mr Matt Kean, on his work in securing this important commitment of $50 million for Hornsby hospital.
