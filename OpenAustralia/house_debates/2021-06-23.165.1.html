        I rise to acknowledge and recognise the exceptional individuals within my own community of Wentworth whose meaningful service to others and Australia was recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours list. Appointed as officers of the Order of Australia for their distinguished service to the community were Mr Peter Ivany and Mr Cameron Kerr. Mr Ivany was recognised for his support for the arts, sports, natural science and not-for-profit organisations and Mr Kerr was recognised for his dedicated service to wildlife conservation, animal science and zoological associations.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of individuals were also appointed as members of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours list in the general division. They include Mr Greg Shand for significant service to the Jewish community and charitable institutions; Mr Simon Bouda for significant service to television and print media; Ms Shayne Brown for significant service to medicine and orthoptics; Professor John Connell for his service to tertiary education; Dr Bronwyn Evans for service to engineering and medical technology; Mr Mark Miller for significant service to visual and performing arts; Professor Robyn Richmond for significant service to tertiary and medical education and public health; Associate Professor Gary Sholler for his significant service to paediatric medicine and tertiary education; Mr Colin Tate, who many here would know, for his service to charitable initiatives; Ms Charlotte Vidor for her significant service to the multicultural community and to urban planning; and Ms Leanne Zalapa for her significant service to the Prince of Wales Hospital Foundation and to health education more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also a number of individuals in my community of Wentworth who were awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . They include Mr Stephen Cordell, Mr Philip Feinstein, Mr Brian Ladd, Dr Alexander Levendel, Dr Michael Newman, Mr Adrian Skurnik, Mr Lee Stockley, Mr Malcolm Young and Mr Morri Young. These people have given service across a range of fields, including medicine and the arts, and to our veterans and our local communities. Finally, I wish to congratulate Mr Jason Elderhurst, who was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for his outstanding contribution to building services within the

        public service.
       </p>
       <p>
        My community of Wentworth, like many communities around the country, is proud and honoured to have such dedicated individuals who give meaningfully of their time, expertise and their family life often enough in order to serve worthy causes and to contribute to the community in meaningful ways. These people are the heart of the social capital that we possess here in Australia. They make our communities stronger and more lively. They look after some of the most vulnerable individuals. They are what makes Australia great. On behalf of the people of Wentworth, I thank and acknowledge all of them.
