        I rise to congratulate the mighty Macquarie Scorpions on the excellent season they had in the real

        , the

        . They lost narrowly in the grand final to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_United" rel="nofollow">

        by 24-18 after leading 18-4 at halftime. I pay tribute to the players who battled through injuries. They have a very young squad, which bodes well for next year. They did a great job getting to the grand final. They were massive underdogs, and to lead for 55 minutes was a tremendous achievement. I also know the eventually successful team, Lakes United, who played the full 80 minutes, and it was great to see the first

        -only grand final in the NRL since 1994.

       <p>
        More important than the work on the field is the work of the Macquarie Scorpions off the field. The team is full of white-ribbon ambassadors, and the leadership of the Macquarie Scorpions has instituted a Let's Tackle Domestic Violence round of the real NRL. They really are champions at confronting domestic violence in the Newcastle region and they are leading from the front. So I want to thank them for their great efforts in championing this very important cause as well as playing some great footy on the field.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank their major sponsors, Toronto Workers Club and Centennial Coal, a very important local employer. I want to wish them the very best of luck for next year. I am sure they will go well and, hopefully, the old saying that you have to lose one to win one comes true. I will finish by saying, 'Go, Scorps!'
