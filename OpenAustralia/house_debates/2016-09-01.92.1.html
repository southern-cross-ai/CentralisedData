        My constituency question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure representing the Minister for Communications. Around 30,000 residents, or around one in four of the adult workforce on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , have to commute very long distances to and from work, including thousands who travel daily on the train line between Newcastle and Sydney. Can the minister please update the House on how the government will upgrade and build telecommunications infrastructure to help improve the lives of Central Coast commuters through better mobile coverage?

         I am very pleased to have this opportunity to respond to this question from the member for Robertson. The member for Robertson spent many years in the telecommunications sector. She has real business experience, like so many people on this side of the House and like virtually nobody on that side of the House. One of the consequences of that was she was able to deploy that expertise in working with the government to arrive at this very exciting policy under which $12 million will be committed to deliver continuous in-train mobile coverage between Hornsby and Wyong, a 60-kilometre rail route. A number of stations will also receive wi-fi along the wayâ€”stations such as Gosford,

         and Cowan.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of this project is that some 30,000

         commuters will be able to use their time more productively as they are sitting on the train going towards Sydney or heading back home at the end of the day. It builds on our $220 million mobile black spot program. It will mean that people will be able to use their time very productively. For example, they will be able to go online and do some research while they are on the train. They might want to go online and research David Feeney's personal interest statements. Did he find any more non-declared negative-geared homes?

           They might want to have a look at a map of where the member for Isaacs lives. Is his residence anywhere in his electorate? They will probably find not. All kinds of research can be usefully done while you are on the train. What we have done with this $12 million commitment is allow people to use their time more productively. We have been able to draw upon the experience of the member for Robertson and we are committing infrastructure here which will allow people to use their time more productively and more efficiently. They will be able to go online while they are on the train. They will be able to go online when they are on stations by using the wi-fi. This is a terrific initiative. It is all about delivery and allowing people on the
