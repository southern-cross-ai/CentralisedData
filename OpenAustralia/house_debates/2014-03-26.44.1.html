       <p>
        Last Saturday, I attended Football Fest Day hosted by Woongarrah Football Club at their home ground at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlyn_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Hamlyn Terrace
        </a>
        . The Woongarrah Wildcats Football Club was formed in 2008 by Kevin and Helen Wilson. They began with a mission to offer members and families a fair, honest and friendly club that everyone would be proud to be a part of.After many long hours of dedicated hard work from the committee, the Woongarrah Football Club has successfully completed six years of football with 640 happy players and families.I was approached by the club earlier this year by dedicated club committee member Karen Drinan to see if I would be interested in supporting their Cadet Referee Program. I must say I had no hesitation in agreeing, and on Saturday I was honoured to present the cadet referees with their jerseys.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cadet Referee Program is a great initiative to provide support and confidence to young referees. What I witnessed there on Saturday was a great community club with a great community spirit. Community organisations such as the Woongarrah Wildcats are a great example of the outstanding sporting organisations that we have in Dobell. In Dobell we are very proud of our sporting talent and very proud of the many volunteers, like Kevin and Helen Wilson and Karen and Tony Drinan, who give their time every week to provide opportunities for particularly our young people to participate in their chosen sport. I commend the committee of the Woongarrah Wildcats for their achievement in establishing this club and for keeping community spirit alive and well in the Woongarrah and Hamlyn Terrace community.
