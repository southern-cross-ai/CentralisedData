       <p>
        My question is to the Treasurer. Last night the Treasurer said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm always cautious about taking people's money off them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Was the Treasurer cautious about ripping away $6,000 from Australian families? Was he cautious about ripping $80 a week away from Australian pensioners, and was he cautious about abolishing the only tax concession low-income earners get for their superannuation contributions?

        <p>
         I am very cautious about policy announcements and making sure that they actually deliver what they promise. That is why we have not promised things like Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. That is why, when we make promises, we seek to deliver them. But I would say this to the member for McMahon: I have a great deal of respect for taxpayers who work damn hard to pay their taxes. I tell you what: I will never apologise for respecting people who work hard and make a contribution to the government for other people's services.
        </p>
        <p>
         On our side of parliament, we know because we have actually worked for people and employed people. There are a sea of small business people here on this side of the House who have employed people and know how hard it is to earn a dollar, to engage in employment practices, to create wealth. I am prepared to match the qualifications of every person on this side of the House against those of people on that side of the House. I understand the difference on the basis of the fact that these people respect tax payers, whereas the Labor Party has total contempt for taxpayers. So there will be no apologies from me for being precious about taxpayers' money.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why we are trying to ensure that Australia lives within its means. You mentioned the carbon tax compensation. We got rid of the carbon tax and kept the compensation in place. We got rid of the carbon tax, reducing the bills for everyday Australian households by $550 a year, and we kept the tax cuts. For pensioners we kept the compensation package when there was no carbon tax.

           So yes, we do have respect for taxpayers. We make no apologies for that.
