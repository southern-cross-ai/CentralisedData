        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister listen to 81 per cent of company directors, who want a cautious phasing-out of fiscal supports such as JobKeeper rather than the government's hard economic snapback?

         Once again, the member for Rankin misrepresents the government's position and he misrepresents the government's policies. He seems to be unaware of the broad range of measures that the government has been putting in place—globally recognised—that are providing the necessary economic supports. We have listened carefully right across the economy, to those working, to those running businesses—particularly to those running businesses. That's why the Treasurer announced the extension of the instant asset write-off, a very important measure. That's why the measures that will kick in in July which involve further support and stimulus payments in the economy in July will be occurring. It's why one of the first things we did was to ensure that jobseeker would be at a sufficient level—

          Can the Prime Minister just pause for a second? Both the Treasurer and the shadow Treasurer are having what looks like a fascinating discussion, but they're about have it outside the chamber. I'm trying to listen to the Prime Minister.

           What the government will continue to do is make decisions about the level of supports we provide into the economy based on the best possible advice and the best reading of the economic situation as that becomes increasingly clear. That's what we're doing as a cabinet. That's what the Expenditure Review Committee, which is the committee of cabinet that is considering these issues, is doing. We are looking at all of those matters extremely carefully. That may not suit the convenience of the member for Rankin or indeed the Leader of the Opposition or anyone else, but, if they want to work to a political timetable and agenda, that's up to them. The government has the important responsibility of calibrating our support for economic lifelines into this country and ensuring they are done in a way that limits the burdens on future generations, that is targeted and comprehensive and that uses the mechanisms that are already in place so as to not risk the sort of waste that we saw when stimulus measures were put in many years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have learnt the lessons of Labor's failures in this area. I'm sure if they'd had the opportunity to sit on these benches, which I'm sure would put a shudder through the spines of all Australians—if they believed that the Labor Party were dealing with this issue right now, it would put a shudder through their spines. Australians will feel very comfortable that this government is taking a mature and responsible approach to calibrating our economic supports on the best available economic data and not rushing off for a headline, which is what the member for Rankin seems only to be interested in.
