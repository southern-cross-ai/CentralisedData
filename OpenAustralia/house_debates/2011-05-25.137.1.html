        I would like to take this opportunity to welcome a major funding contribution in my electorate of

        . The Albany Community Care Respite Centre has been allocated $1.1 million in funds over three years under the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services through the state and federal governments. This will allow the facility to operate on a full-time basis for the next three years and deliver an essential service to Albany and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Southern" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        region. I had the privilege of announcing this funding alongside my Nationals WA colleagues when I visited Albany last week. To say the news was warmly received—

       <p class="italic">

         A division having been called in the House of Representatives—

       <p>
        Proceedings suspended from 09 : 45 to 09 : 51
       </p>
       <p>
        This news was what the respite care staff, centre staff and many carers residing in the Great Southern had been waiting for for more than a year. This funding means the Albany Community Respite Centre will now be available to provide 1,460 bed-days each year of respite care for local and visiting patients. It is very positive news for carers and their families living in the Great Southern.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albany Community Care Respite Centre is a brand new facility, constructed in 2010 with a generous amount of community support. However, a lack of funds means it has been able to operate for just one week each month. The respite centre will now allow carers to take a much-needed break to recharge and refresh, knowing that their loved ones are in good hands. A service like this, in a major regional centre like Albany, is vitally important to ensuring that regional Australia is sustainable. Indeed, according to Carers Australia, a break for respite care, whether it be for a few hours or a few days, will significantly increase the duration that a carer will continue to provide care. I believe that many families will benefit from this service, and the availability of respite care in Albany will continue to keep families living in the Great Southern.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past several months I have campaigned strongly to secure ongoing funding for this respite centre and I am very fortunate to have a strong supporter in the federal health minister, the Hon.

I wish to thank the Albany Community Care Respite Centre manager, Colleen Tombleson, who took me on numerous tours of the facility and was always available if I had any questions. I also thank the Nationals WA for their continued support for the project, particularly the Hon. Colin Holt

        Carers provide a valuable service to our country, taking on what can often be a thankless job. I commend the state and federal governments on their decision to fully fund this vital service—
