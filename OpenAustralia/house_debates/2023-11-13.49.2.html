        Labor are desperately failing the Australian public. Since the election, we've heard continuous promise after promise that it was going to be easier under Labor. I say that it's getting harder and harder. Every day it's harder. Electricity prices are up 18 per cent. Families right across the electorate of Wright are telling me how difficult it is to deal with the cost-of-living pressures. Electricity prices are up 18 per cent, and that flows through to our food producers. The largest contributor to

        in my electorate is agriculture; we produce vegetables. When electricity prices are up, costs for the packing houses, the produce houses, go up, and those have to be passed on to mums and dads, and the Australian public, when they buy products at the grocery store.

        What happened to the $275 that Labor promised on a heap of occasions that they were going to deliver to the Australian public? It never came, and that's why Labor is failing our public. We've seen an eight per cent increase in the price of food, again, as a result of the extra cost of goods. We've seen the 12 interest rate rises and inflation is out of control. There are many things that we can do with the fiscal levers, but this government aren't doing them. They're continuing to pump in funds after funds. The Labor government are failing the Australian people.
