       <p>
        Last week, I had the pleasure of hosting a work experience student from St Andrew's Catholic College in Cairns, young Harrison Thyrd. He's in year 10 and is an aspiring politician. Harrison certainly picked the right week to attend work experience with me, as the Prime Minister joined us in Cairns. Not only did Harrison get to feel what life would be like as a politician; he also got to attend numerous media events and community meetings with me throughout the week.

        As we're all aware, school is not the same as the working world, and I believe we have an obligation to young people in our electorates to provide them with the experience necessary to help them enter the workforce. These critical skills, including teamwork, communication and cooperation, are amongst many other common skills required in the current and ever-changing workforce. Having work experience as part of the curriculum in schools is vital, to ensure that our students acquire introductory experience in their desired careers. It also assist students who are unsure of their future pathway to attempt avenues. In addition, undertaking work experience in year 10 assists students in choosing their subjects in senior years, a decision that will likely impact on them for the rest of their lives.
       </p>

        It was an absolute pleasure to host Harrison. I'd encourage all members of this place to take the opportunity to host school students in their electorates.
