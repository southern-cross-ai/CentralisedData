       <p>
        I rise to speak on the positive impact that the coalition policy for direct action on climate change will have on the local environment in my electorate of Indi, north-east Victoria. It is a very important slice of Australia, particularly with regard to the environment and its significant contribution of water to the Murray-Darling Basin. People in my electorate have been crying out not to be punished but to be rewarded, to have incentives to continue to contribute to improving the environment and reducing carbon emissions. I am very pleased to say that the coalition’s policy of direct action has a key role for rural and regional areas to reduce carbon emissions and to help the environment. From the additional $1,000 grant for solar power and hot water to the Solar Towns and Schools initiative, locals will be encouraged to take up the incentives and to do their bit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Green groups in my electorate were horrified at the government’s proposal not only because it was a significant tax but because, importantly, it would do nothing to reward them for the efforts they were making in reducing carbon emissions. That caused significant distress in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our direct action plan is not only practical, which is what country people are, but also much cheaper. Our plan is $3.2 billion, as opposed to a $40.6 billion tax-and-churn system full of bureaucracy and inefficiency that would even allow the purchase of abatement from overseas to offset emission increases in Australia. We do not believe that Australian businesses and consumers should be slugged with a new tax. We have seen the cost of living increase in the last two years, to the distress of many families whether they are paying mortgages or not, and we do not believe that they can afford this brand new tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the coalition’s plan, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replenish a very valuable natural resource that we have—that is, our soils. I look forward to working together with many local organisations, individuals, farmers and businesses to see how north-east Victoria, my electorate of Indi, can benefit from the incentives in the coalition’s action plan for direct action.
