       <p>
        This week is Reconciliation Week, and my electorate of Cooper comes together like no-one else, I reckon, to acknowledge and celebrate the importance of Reconciliation Week. I'm really proud to share today the achievements of one of our wonderful local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm honoured to represent my electorate of Cooper. It's home to many First Nations people and First Nations organisations. Dardi Munwurro is a local organisation established in 2000 to provide group leadership training programs tailored to Aboriginal men and youth. Dardi Munwurro, which means 'strong spirit', is a specialist Aboriginal service. They aim to empower and inspire individuals by delivering a range of family violence programs to break the cycle of harm in First Nations families and communities. Under the leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Thorpe" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
         John Byrne
        </a>
        , Dardi Munwurro helps young Aboriginal men to become leaders within their community. The organisation creates safe spaces for self-reflection and learning, hosting men's gatherings and camps where they can bring important issues affecting the local community to the fore. I'm so grateful for the incredible support of many local leaders who lend a helping hand to Alan and his team, including the

        and the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        A good yarn goes a long way. Having a trusted person on the end of a call for help is so valuable. The Brother to Brother 24-hour crisis line, staffed by Aboriginal men with lived experience, provides support for callers in relation to relationships, family violence, parenting or drug and alcohol challenges. I can't thank enough the local Aboriginal men and elders who take these calls and provide a local connection point for their community. Cooper has a strong First Nations community, whether it's on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        field, in the First Nations owned businesses on the local high street, coming together to support the Voice to Parliament or standing up and supporting each other in their times of crisis.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconciliation_Week" rel="nofollow">
         National Reconciliation Week
        </a>
        is a time for all Australians to learn about our shared histories, cultures and achievements. This year, the theme of 'Be a voice for generations' is an important opportunity to reflect.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to Cooper coming together later this year to vote in the referendum. Any referendum is a significant moment, but this referendum will be history making. A voice to parliament enshrined in our Constitution will indeed be a voice for generations.
