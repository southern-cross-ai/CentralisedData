       <p>
        I rise to bring to the attention of the House the concerns of my constituents about Labor's retiree tax. Cowper has an older demographic. Many of them are self-funded retirees who have worked hard all their life, scrimping and saving to build a nest egg for their retirement. What does the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        propose to do? It proposes to rob them. It proposes to rob their retirement by way of this unfair tax. It is an outrage that this is being hatched on our self-funded retirees. These retirees have worked so hard. What does the Labor Party say to do? The shadow Treasurer arrogantly says, 'If you don't like our retiree tax, don't vote for Labor.' I think that's probably one of the first sensible things that the member for McMahon has said. He said, 'If you don't like the retiree tax, don't vote for Labor at the next election.' I couldn't agree more.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the seat of Cowper, it is a little bit more complicated because we have an alleged Independent candidate running. I say 'alleged' because he propped up the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government for years. It is a little bit more complicated. If you don't want the retiree tax, don't vote Labor. But don't vote for the Independent candidate, who will also deliver you a Labor government.
