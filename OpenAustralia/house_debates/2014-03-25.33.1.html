        . That means that what up until now has been a search moves into a recovery and investigation phase. I have this morning spoken to Prime Minister Najib Razak. I have offered Malaysia—as the country legally responsible for this—every assistance and cooperation from Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This plane is lost in one of the most inaccessible parts of our globe. It is a long way from anywhere. But the closest land is Australia, and we are the best placed country to assist. It is highly likely that in coming days and weeks many of the relatives of passengers on ill-fated flight 370 will wish to come to Australia. I want them all to know that should they come here they will be in the arms of a decent country. I should also let the House know that the government has decided to waive visa fees for any relatives wishing to come to Australia. I should at this point express my condolences and the House's condolences regarding the Australian passengers on that flight, and I propose that we might have a formal condolence motion for them tomorrow.

         I rise to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister. Our thoughts today are with all the families and friends of the passengers and crew of

          MH
         </a>
         370. The pain of not knowing what has happened to one's family has now given way to the agony of loss. We too offer our sympathies to all of those whose worst fears have been realised. These matters are never easy to deal with, but to have to wear a very public loss when perhaps you would seek to mourn in peace and privacy must have been very difficult. The disappearance of MH370 is a mystery that has captured global attention. Unlike perhaps some disasters that occur around the world, because all of the citizens of the world fly, this disaster is one that touches all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia can be rightly proud of the leading effort it has played in the international search effort. Our service men and women have taken on an extremely difficult task with determination and dedication. This search has brought nations together. Australia is proud of the Australian contribution, and I believe the world is grateful to them. We may never know the full story of MH370, but we do know that there will be families consumed by grief today and in the years to come. Our hearts go out to them.
