       <p>
        I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight the extraordinary bravery of a Tasmanian man,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_Seaman" rel="nofollow">
         Ordinary Seaman
        </a>
        Edward Sheean—known as Teddy to his mates—who died on 1 December 1942 while protecting his mates on the corvette
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        . Teddy's bravery is confirmed in our military history and, although he was posthumously mentioned in despatches for that bravery, by any measure he deserves much higher recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent years I have been a guest speaker at commemoration ceremonies for Teddy in Latrobe, Tasmania. The level of interest in his story is remarkable. I have strolled through the Sheean Walk in Latrobe many times, including with Teddy's nephew, Garry Ivory, and the sense of pride and respect that accompanies Teddy's memory is palpable. This is because, although

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        , his actions were clearly extraordinary enough to generate this continuing level of respect and admiration. A submarine is named after him; songs and a historical walk are dedicated in his honour; and he is the subject of books, articles, media stories and even television programs like
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Story" rel="nofollow">

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The respect afforded to Teddy's memory reinforces that the actions of an individual can inspire many others. I refer here not just to military comrades but to communities and nations. Teddy's sacrifice set in motion a historical ripple that continues to lap against the hearts and minds of many Australians. And little wonder, given the circumstances of Teddy Sheean's bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 1 December 1942, HMAS
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        was sinking in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arafura_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Arafura Sea
        </a>
        after being attacked by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese aircraft were firing at those in the water. The captain had given the order to abandon ship yet this young man, not even 20 years of age, staggered back to an Oerlikon gun and started firing at the Japanese aircraft that were shooting his mates in the water. Twice wounded, he continued firing until the ship sank. He died with the
        <i>
         Armidale

        . The Navy's official history of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , in the understated language of the day, records:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bomber fell to Ordinary Seaman Sheean at the after oerlikon, who remained at the gun when the ship sank.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those twenty words are fleshed out in a footnote on the same page, where Teddy's shipmate, Ordinary Seaman R.M. Caro, adds pathos to this stark description:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Teddy died, but none of us who have survived, I am sure, will ever forget his gallant deed … None of us will ever know what made him do it, but he went back to his gun, strapped himself in, and brought down a Jap plane, still firing as he disappeared beneath the waves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite being wounded, Teddy continued to protect his shipmates—to put the lives of others before his own. Yet, in my view, our system has failed Teddy Sheean; it continues to fail in appropriately acknowledging his bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commanding officers of Australian Navy ships in 1942 were not permitted to specify the nature of the award they were submitting. Whereas Australian Imperial Force and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        awards were decided by Australians in Australia, our Navy had to submit its recommendations to the admiralty in London for consideration by an honours and awards committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sheean's deeds were also suppressed from public knowledge by a decision of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        on 9 December 1942 to 'impose a complete publicity ban upon HMAS
        <i>
         Armidal
        </i>
        <i>

        story.' The captain of the
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        was one of only 47 survivors from a ship's company of 149 men. They survived for days at sea before being rescued. Sheean's case was not supported with the determination it deserved. He was a small fish in the very deep halls of the British admiralty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I again add my voice in the strongest possible terms to Teddy's cause. His actions fit the criteria for much higher recognition. They were conspicuous and daring and constituted a pre-eminent act of valour and self-sacrifice against impossible odds. His was a display of rare and mighty courage that sits comfortably within that small and select group of people who have previously been awarded much higher awards for gallantry. I support Teddy's family and friends in fighting on to get Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean the recognition his valour and sacrifice so richly deserve.
