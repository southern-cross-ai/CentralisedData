        I thank the member for Kingston for visiting Swan. It is a pity I was not able to join her. But it was also a pity that she was not there either when we announced $20 million for the Curtin Medical School, which I see the opposition take little interest in at all. Also in my electorate, which I know the member for Kingston did not visit, was a function on Friday night for the Manning Memorial Bowling Club. I know many people in the audience here probably participate in bowls. It is one of the most participated in sports in Australia. It was their presentation night. It was a night for all their awards. There were about 60 people there.

        I would like to congratulate particularly the women's team of the Manning Memorial Bowling Club because, out of the 12 participants who made the WA state team, seven of them came from the Manning Memorial Bowling Club. As you can see, they were not only well represented; they were overrepresented. That obviously indicates the strong women's team they have at the Manning Memorial Bowling Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Graham and Laura, who were nominated the men's and women's bowlers of the year of the club. I also congratulate Faye Doran, who was there. She is the patron of the club and has been an institution at the Manning Memorial Bowling Club for many years. I hope to see her around at the bowls club for many years to come. Congratulations to the people at the Manning Memorial Bowling Club who participate in the sport, particularly the young people as it is often seen as more of a senior sport. I say congratulations again to the Manning Memorial Bowling Club.
