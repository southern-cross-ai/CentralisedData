        I remind my friend the member for Hume that Regional Partnerships, better known as the regional rorts scheme, had nothing like the level of scrutiny and independence that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
         RDA
        </a>
        process has now. I can understand that he might be upset that a number of his projects did not get up—as mine did not either—but I will tell you what: between this and the regional rorts program, I know which one has a much more meritorious structure and more independence.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to continue, if I may, talking about the progressive industries and enterprises that exist in my electorate of Braddon on the north-west and west coast of Tasmania. I spoke about the dairying industry and the fantastic investment that is now underway in that industry. I would now like to turn to mining. The mining industry is consolidating strongly in Tassie, particularly on the west coast, which is part of my electorate. Commodity prices remain strong with copper, tin, tungsten, silver and zinc showing particular value. Gold prices are also very high. In recent years the number of exploration leases issued in our region has been at record levels and demand from key markets such as China and India remains robust. Over 3,400 people are employed in the resource extraction sector, either as employees or contractors, and around 70 per cent of these are on the north-west and west coasts, and there are a number of major projects planned which will likely continue the expansion in the next couple of years. These include Beacons Hill Resources for magnesite; Proto Resources for nickel and cobalt; Venture Minerals for iron, tin and tungsten;

        Scheelite for scheelite; and Shree Minerals for iron. As demand for skilled labour across the mining sector nationally increases, the Tasmanian mining sector offers potential for well-paid work in a number of key regional locations in the coming years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aquaculture is another major enterprise and industry in Tasmania. Tasmania's aquaculture industry is the largest in Australia, accounting for around one-quarter of the total national fisheries output. The industry employs at least 1,100 people across the island and has increased the value of its production by seven per cent in the year just gone. Within the region, the major salmon/ocean trout producers are planning a significant expansion and consolidation of an industry hub on the west coast and one major producer has recently opened a new processing facility in Devonport, with the creation of new jobs for local people. Global demand for aquaculture products continues to increase and Tasmania is well placed to take a leading role in meeting this demand. The industry here uses world-best technology and enjoys relative pest- and disease-free status for farmed fish.
       </p>
       <p>
        The r ed m eat f arming and processing industries are also highly significant. These are key agricultural sectors for Tasmania, with over 4,900 people employed in cattle/sheep farming and meat processing across the state. Just over one-quarter of these jobs are in my region in the north-west, with the majority of meat processing being done on King Island and at Smithton and Longford. Market prices for sheep and beef meat continue to be strong, with increasing demand by consumers for sustainably produced food. This represents a strong point of advantage for high-quality Tasmanian produce. The sector continues to offer good employment prospects for skilled labour in the coming years.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 Specialist manufacturing is also a feature of our region. It is a key sector for Tasmania, covering marine manufacturing, metal manufacturing, casting, specialised machinery and engineering. Across the s tate it employs over 3,300 people, with nearly one - quarter of these in my region at expanding major enterprises such as Caterpillar in Burnie. Caterpillar has undertaken a number of innovative employment programs in recent times, offering life-changing training and subsequent careers to groups of people co m ing out of often long - term unemployment. This is only one of the success stories where Tasmanian ingenuity and innovation continues to offer future opportunities to local people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of my region has been selected as part of the place based initiative.

        example is an excellent template, which can be replicated throughout the rest of Australia and particularly rural and regional Australia for training long-term unemployed people.
