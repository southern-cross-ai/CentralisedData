       <p>
        Inala is an outstanding organisation in my electorate which reflects so much of our community that makes me proud. It was founded in 1958 to provide the highest quality support to individuals living with disability, allowing each client or resident to reach their maximum potential. Inala has always been an organisation that values each person and believes that everyone should be enabled to live a life of purpose and meaning. They celebrate the unique contribution of each human being regardless of their disability, gender, race or background.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today Inala provides accommodation, specialised day programs, therapy services, life skills training and community participation programs. The age of the organisation means that Inala now has clients who've been part of its community for many years and have changing needs as they age. Inala's longest term client is Russell, who has benefited from Inala's work for 62 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inala was one of our successful applicants in the Stronger Communities grants program, receiving $15,000 towards the renovation and refurbishment of one of their older buildings. This renovation will include the provision of accessible bathrooms to allow the use of hoists and wheelchairs, and the refurbishment of rooms will enable Inala to provide a new day service to support maturing clients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Inala and the important work they do for people living with disability and their families. From their
