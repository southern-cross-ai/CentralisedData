       <p>
        Australia is one of the world's most successful multicultural nations. It's in our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>
        to celebrate everything that binds us together. That's what makes us Australian. But, equally as important, the other side of that coin is the maturity in which we embrace and accept our national diversity. Our tapestry of cultures, faiths and beliefs all form the complex fabric that makes our society work. If we are to accept that this enriches our community, our diversity, and our commonality, then we must also accept that it is vital that both are fiercely and equally protected.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are fortunate in Australia that our education options currently mirror our diverse society, and it is crucial that to protect these. Being involved in faith based education is a choice that is increasing year on year in Australia. Parents choose to send their children to faith based schools. Teachers choose to teach within these faith based schools. Support staff choose to seek employment within these faith based schools. There is no compulsion. In doing so, they agree to adhere to the ethos of those schools. If you don't wish to work, or have your children learn, within the ethos of a faith based school, then there are an array of other fantastic options available to you.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the very existence of religious schools and their ability to provide faith based education is being threatened. Today it is expected that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>
        will recommend the removal of section 38 from the Sexual Discrimination Act. These sweeping reforms, if legislated by the Albanese government, will remove exemptions that currently allow religious schools to preference the employment of teachers and other staff who share their beliefs. In essence, schools will be required to employ staff who are antagonistic to their religious teachings and missions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that the Albanese government reject this attack on the freedom of our faith based schools. We must continue to support the rights of parents to choose the school that they see as best. It is a fundamental part of Australia's multicultural and multifaith tradition. Parents choose faith based schools because they want their children educated in a community where staff adhere to and support their family's faith traditions. It's crucial that this doesn't change. I call on this government to vehemently reject these proposals.
