       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter of privilege under standing order 51. I would ask you to examine the statements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        in relation to his involvement in matters concerning James Ashby and the former Speaker Peter Slipper. To assist you in considering this matter, I provide you with the following material: the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        <i>
         s
        </i>
        of the minister's answers in question time in the House of Representatives from 23 November to 2 December 2015; the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        of the minister's statement on indulgence to the House of Representatives on 2 December 2015; and tweets by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Producer" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Producer
        </a>
        of
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        which include transcripts of an interview between journalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
         Liz Hayes
        </a>
        and the minister for
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        on Channel 9.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also request that you examine any statements made or answers given by the minister to the House of Representatives today, the
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        television program broadcast on Channel 9 on 7 September 2014 and a story by journalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Oakes" rel="nofollow">
         Laurie Oakes
        </a>
        broadcast on Channel 9 television news on 1 December 2015 in which an excerpt of the original version of the
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        interview was played. Specifically, I ask you to consider the interaction between the minister's admission on
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        that he had asked James Ashby to procure copies of the former Speaker's diary for him, the minister's answer during question time on 1 December 2015 in relation to the
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        interview that what was put to air was not the full question, the minister's statement on indulgence in the House on 2 December 2015 and the minister's denial in question time on 2 December 2015 that he had asked James Ashby to procure copies of the former Speaker's diary for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the contradictory nature of these statements and given the minister's particular responsibility for matters affecting the standards of integrity for members of parliament, I ask you to consider giving precedence to a motion to refer to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests whether the minister's statements in the House from 23 November to 3 December 2015 have deliberately misled the House such as to constitute an offence of an improper interference with the free exercise of the House of its authority or functions.

         I thank the member for Watson. I will carefully consider the matter he has raised and all of the material he has provided as well. I will report back to the House at the earliest opportunity but, given the volume of the material, it clearly will not be today.
