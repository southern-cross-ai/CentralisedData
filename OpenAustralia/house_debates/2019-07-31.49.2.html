        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that tax cuts would be legislated before 1 July, he said that the member for Durack would remain environment minister and he said that the government would create a national integrity commission. Were any of those commitments true?

         I'm very thankful to the Leader of the Opposition for raising the issue of our commitment to tax cuts, which not only provide tax relief today but provide tax relief for Australians out into the future as well. The harder they work and the more they earn, the more they keep of what they earn. That's what we promised to the Australian people and that's what we delivered, and the Labor Party sought to oppose us every single step of the way. They remain opposed to tax relief and, if they're elected into this place at a subsequent election, they will roll back the tax relief that has been legislated for the Australian people. Even now, some several months after the election, the Labor Party continues to tear itself apart about its $387 billion of higher taxes. They have members over there who are clinging onto those taxes for dear life. They worked so hard to put that massive tax burden into their election platform to take to the Australian people. Now they know they have to make a choice: are they going to tax Australians more or are they going to follow the government's approach and ensure they get their expenditure under control so that the government can live within its means and deliver the essential services that Australians rely upon? That's what my government is delivering.
