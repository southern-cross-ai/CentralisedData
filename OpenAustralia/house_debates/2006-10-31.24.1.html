        My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on the success of the government’s Regional Partnerships program? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any comments regarding the future of this program? What is his response?

         I thank the member for Cowper for his question. The member for Cowper recognises the significant importance of this program in assisting regional communities with their economic and social structures and the improvement that can take place with the assistance of the federal government. The member for Cowper would be aware that since 2003 about 1,088 projects have been funded to the tune of $213 million, having been approved by the government. But, most importantly, with all those projects, for every dollar that has been put in by the Commonwealth there has been $3 contributed by the partners, whether they be community groups or organisations, or local councils. So for every dollar we have put in we have attracted an extra $3 invested in those communities. One classic example in the member for Cowper’s electorate is the Shearwater Patients and Carers Lodge in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
          Coffs Harbour
         </a>
         , which received $245,000 in Regional Partnerships funding. Local doctor and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Rotary Club
         </a>
         member Dr Paul Moran said of the project:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Without the Regional Partnerships Program the Shearwater Lodge could not have been built. Shearwater Lodge is a great facility and Regional Partnerships is a great program.
        </p>
        <p>
         So that is in the electorate of the member for Cowper. Yesterday we heard from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         spokesman, the member for Hotham, in a personal explanation at the end of question time, his commitment to maintain this program—and if we have a look at the website, under the page that features the member for Hotham, it is also there. But we have not had that commitment from the Leader of the Opposition. The last comment that the Leader of the Opposition made on Regional Partnerships that we have been able to find was made last year. I quote it:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... the program’s got to go. And we’re going to fight like blazes between now and the Budget to force them to cancel this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was the Leader of the Opposition then, and, on the weekend, in talking about regional policy, he had the chance to make the commitment that the member for Hotham made in this House yesterday, that the Labor Party will keep this program. I hope, Member for Hotham, that your confidence in the leader is very strong—because we all know that the Leader of the Opposition walked away from you once before, on your preselection. I hope he backs you up in supporting the Regional Partnerships program, which is very important to regional Australia. We intend to keep this regional program that has been incredibly valuable for regional Australia. I am pleased to hear the member for Hotham wants to keep it as well. What we need to hear from the Leader of the Opposition is that the Labor Party is going to keep it.
