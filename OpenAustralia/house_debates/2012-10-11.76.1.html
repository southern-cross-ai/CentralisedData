       <p>
        I rise to congratulate Launceston University of Tasmania lecturer Andrew Seen for being awarded a citation for outstanding contributions to student learning at the Australian Awards for University Teaching in Melbourne last week. Dr Seen has spent only two years away from the Newnham campus since being a student there in 1982. He has used his unique style to help students follow their scientific interests for the past 15 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 160 Australian lecturers received recognition and Dr Seen was one of only three from Tasmania. Dr Seen encourages people to take responsibility for their own learning and guides them through their work. His research interests are in the development and application of passive sampling devices for sampling contaminants in the environment, as well as in understanding the sources, history and mobility of contaminants in the environment. Dr Seen's recent work includes establishing a historical profile of heavy metal pollution in the

        through analysis of sediment cores from the Tamar Estuary, as well as studies on contaminant mobility at impacted sites in Antarctica. His research activities involve collaboration with industry and government organisations, including the
