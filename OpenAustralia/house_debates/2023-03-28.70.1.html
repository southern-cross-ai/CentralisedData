        at Dixons Long Point, between Orange and Mudgee. With a solid benefit-cost ratio, substantial funding had been committed, cultural heritage considerations were cooperatively addressed and the project had gone out to tender. There was even $27.8 million of allocated funding sitting in the kitty. Where is this money now? Will you and your government support this game-changing project?

          ALBANESE (—) (): I thank the member for Calare for his question and I also thank him for raising this issue with me on behalf of his constituents when we met in my office a while ago. I know that he is very passionate about this project to provide a road link between Orange and Mudgee. It is a complex proposal because it does, of course, involve a river crossing, and therefore the costs have been assessed. Unfortunately, it's been much higher than $27.8 million. Like many of the commitments that were made opposite, essentially, you can't fund half a road. You can't just have one side and you can't have it go just half the way. You need to have the entire funding there, which is why I look forward to and I have raised the issue with my minister for infrastructure and transport as to whether there would be an interest as well in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

          government—the incoming New South Wales government—also being engaged with this project or, indeed, with the shire councils in this area.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will certainly come back to the member for Calare about this. We have allocated some $23 billion to New South Wales for infrastructure projects over the next decade, with substantial investment right across all states and territories. As the member knows, because I travelled with him to Calare during the natural disasters which, tragically, a lot of his electorate was impacted by, we continue to invest where it's needed to deal with the natural disasters that had a devastating impact—in particular, the floods in his community.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to working with the member for Claire and thank him for the question.
