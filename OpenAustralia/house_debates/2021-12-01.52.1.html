        There are many organisations, charities, groups and businesses in my electorate of Longman that offer great support services and advice to our senior residents on a range of matters from health to retirement. However, we identified that it can be a bit challenging for some older people in our community to access the essential supports and services that are available to them, so my team and I set about organising an event where the senior member of our community could find out, all in one place, just how many services are available to them. And the Longman Seniors Expo was born.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I held the inaugural 2021 Longman Seniors Expo, after two earlier attempts were stymied by COVID, at two different locations, at Morayfield and on

        </a>
        . This expo gave local seniors the opportunity to speak with around 80 organisations at one location about health matters, retirement advice and the latest products and services tailored for seniors. We also had some great local community groups people could join, like Lions, Probus, Zonta, Men's Shed, as well as groups like Meals on Wheels, Toastmasters and

        </a>
        along with retirement and aged-care options. We had hundreds of local residents turn up to each expo, and I've received a lot of positive feedback, including from people who are already asking when the next one will be held. I want to thank all of the exhibitors and guests as well as our major sponsor, Moreton Bay Region Industry and Tourism, for their support.
