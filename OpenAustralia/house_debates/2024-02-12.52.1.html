        It has been quite an innings for Sylvia Wendt who celebrated her 100th birthday last month. A true westie, Silvia has spent 96 of her 100 years in Melbourne's west, spending her childhood in Footscray and her adult life in Sunshine. Her father moved the family from Tasmania for work on the railways in Yarraville. Sylvia is amazingly digitally connected, having recently upgraded to her second iPad with the support of her daughter Gayle. She is an avid user of Facebook and FaceTime and uses both to keep in touch with family and relatives overseas.

        While celebrating her 100th birthday with 70 friends and family members at the Sunshine
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , Sylvia was asked how she keeps her youthful attitude and looks. Her answer was lattes, cakes, a social life and no exercise or vegetables. This is something I imagine many in this chamber across the aisles would be happy to get on board with. But it is a salient reminder of the importance of social connections, which have so many health benefits. Places like the Sunshine RSL, where Sylvia is a local patron, are an important lifeline for so many in our community. Hats off to the Sunshine RSL because I know how hard all the staff and volunteers work in organising social events and special celebrations. There are always too many people to thank but I want to make particular mention of Garry Collins, the president of the Sunshine RSL, and his very hardworking committee.
