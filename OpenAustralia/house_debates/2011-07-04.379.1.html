          Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was great to hear Brett William and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Ford" rel="nofollow">
           Graham Ford

          speak about the history of surf life saving and where their organisation is headed into the future. The surf life saving movement began in 1907 when volunteer lifesavers began to protect the lives of fellow beachgoers in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          by performing patrols and rescues.
         </p>
         <p>
          The by-laws which banned bathing in daylight hours since the 1830s were gradually repealed between 1902 and 1905, in response to the increasing popularity of surf bathing, and a growing consensus that bathing in appropriate clothing was not an immoral act. The impact of these changes was that beachgoers entered the surf in rapidly escalating numbers. The surf was new to most surf bathers and many could not swim, so with its increasing popularity came more drowning and consequent attempts at rescue.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Australians decided to embrace the ocean as a site of recreational activity in the early part of the 20th century, our love for the beach emerged. The need for a lifesaving movement to protect lives grew, and from that day onwards, surf lifesaving became part of the fabric of our country. Since that time, volunteer lifesavers have saved more than 550,000 lives. This is a tremendous achieveÂ­ment for a volunteer organisation, and last season it rescued more than 12,000 lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          This morning Graham and Brett spoke about the introduction of women to surf lifesaving in 1980. This was, shamefully, a contentious move at the time. I am proud to say today that women now make up between 45 and 48 per cent of our membership. Surf lifesaving is an active part of Australian communities. Our movement prides itself on offering mateship, education, experience and, in doing so, gives back to the community. I am a proud member and president of both the Launceston and Bridport surf life saving clubs. This is the first year of operation for the Bridport
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
           Surf Life Saving
          </a>
          Club. We had 135 members join in its first year. This club is an important part of their community and I am humbled that so many people joined. The skills gained by nippers will stick to the soul like sand from the beach and be carried for life.
         </p>
         <p>
          Surf lifesaving is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in Australia. This is important as we are in an age where no-one seems to be joining any organisations or groups. Indeed, we find that as our nippers reach the age of about 14 and have part-time jobs and studies, they are unable to dedicate themselves to surf lifesaving, but we usually welcome them back when they get older. For people young and old,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Surf Life Saving Australia
          </a>
          inspires a positive and uniquely Australian attitude because every member of every club, the entire movement, embraces and promotes a 'can do' attitude to life. At the last count, there were 307 clubs in Australia, 13 of which are located in my home state of Tasmania.
         </p>
         <p>
          Following a survey of members and the public, the iconic symbol of the red and yellow quarter cap is to be retained by the surf lifesaving movement. A priority for Surf Life Saving Australia this year is the completion and release of the report into the economic contribution of surf lifesaving in Australia. This report will be released later in the year.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to thank all those members and senators who attended this morning, and I congratulate them on their membership. It is estimated that Australia has 100 million beach visitations each year and safety is a vital part of that. Surf lifesaving offers public first aid and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR" rel="nofollow">
           CPR
          </a>
          courses. I encourage all to be part of Surf Life Saving Australia and I commend all those who joined this morning.
