        I rise today to congratulate my constituent Jessica Camilleri on being nominated for the Saward Dawson Community Service and Social Impact Award, under the Victorian government's Young Achiever Awards. Jessica joined the Meadows volunteers pathway at Meadows Primary School three years ago. Since working there, she has gone on to complete a diploma in children services and hopes one day to be a primary school teacher.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to meet and have a chat with Jessica earlier this month, and to see firsthand the important work she does as a volunteer at the school's play group. Together with the staff and volunteers of the early learning program, she has been working on the development of a movement for learning program, which I also got to see that day when I visited. It's a program filled with colour, movement and learning—such a wonderful initiative, led by community hub coordinator Maureen Leahy, whose hard work in creating a meaningful, safe and inspirational learning environment in the early learning program should also be commended.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank Jessica for all her efforts in moulding and shaping the youngest members of my Calwell community to be the best they can be. I wish her all the best for her future—hers is a very bright future in teaching. I congratulate Jessica, and I congratulate Maureen for running a wonderful program at Meadows Primary School. Our community is very fortunate to have such wonderful people living, working and volunteering among us.
