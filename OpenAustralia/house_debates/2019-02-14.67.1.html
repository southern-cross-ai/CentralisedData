        My question is to Minister for Families and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . Recently I hosted an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        forum where participants shared their frustration at not being allowed to see their draft plan prior to it being submitted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        , with some plans with the wrong birthdate and name, leading to weeks of delay and exclusion of services, and, worse still, some plans not reflecting what was requested or needed. Twenty-seven-year-old Mitchell has spastic quadriplegia and needs assistive technology to open his front door. Instead, he was given a gym membership. Not being allowed to view the draft plan leaves many feeling disempowered and disrespected. Minister, why won't you let participants view a copy of their draft NDIS plan before it being submitted for approval?

         I do thank the member for Mayo for her question. She's shown a strong interest in the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with her on a number of cases. In relation to the instances she's mentioned, I will be very happy to speak to her about the specifics of those.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member is absolutely right to emphasise the importance of the plan. It is very important that a plan is developed which meets the needs of the participant in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We now have 250,000 Australians supported by the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and the process of having their plan developed and finalised is absolutely critical. That's why the National Disability Insurance Agency, under our Liberal-National government, has been working to improve the arrangements in relation to plans. For example, from October of last year, a new general participant pathway was rolled out so that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         participants can be assured of having a face-to-face meeting as part of the process of developing their plan, and, of course, as the plan is developed, there's an iterative engagement process with their local area coordinator.
        </p>
        <p>
         That fits with a range of other changes and reforms that we have introduced, including, for example, the enhanced myplace portal, the enhanced provider finder, specialist pathways for participants with particular needs. So in October we announced a new tailored psychosocial disability stream.

            The member for Mayo will resume her seat. As I've pointed out on numerous occasions, in a 45-second question there is more than just one question and even ifâ€”Member for Mayo, I'm trying to address your point of order; I don't really want to have a nodding contest with you, if that's okay. So I'll take a little bit of time to do that. In a 45-second question, the member for Mayo might believe there is just one question, but all of the other material that's a nonquestion, strictly speaking, shouldn't be there. I allow it, really just for the smooth functioning of the House, to be honest. But you can't insist that the minister not refer to it. You simply can't. If you want to ask a single question, just ask it. The minister has the call.

             In relation to plans, the point I'd make to the member is there clearly has to be a point in the process at which the plan is finalised Â Â Â and provided to the participant. What's very important to be clear on is that, if the participant has concerns about the planâ€”and of course there will be instances where the plan is not perfect; of course that's the caseâ€”then the participant has the opportunity, first of all, to ask for an internal review of the plan. That happens regularly and routinely, and changes are regularly made if it turns out that the review recommends that changes should be made. Then there's also the opportunity to go to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
              AAT
             </a>
             to appeal in terms of the contents of the plan, and that also regularly and routinely happens.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do thank the member for her strong interest in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             , now serving some 250,000 Australians. There are always improvements we can make and we are working hard to make continuing improvementsâ€”improving the participant pathway; new specialised participant pathways, where appropriate; and continuing to deliver a fundamental reform, now supporting some 250,000 Australians, transforming and improving lives.
