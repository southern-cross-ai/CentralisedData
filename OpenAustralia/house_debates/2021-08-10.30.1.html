       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of visiting Cedar Creek State School, a small but proud school with a strong community spirit in my electorate of Forde. It was my honour to present them with a cheque for $2,572 for a stronger communities grant that they were successful in achieving. The grant will be used for new sporting equipment for the school's early years program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cedar Creek State School understand that what happens in the years prior to commencing school is critical to setting up children to have a positive start. That's why they've developed the early years program to support and engage children in early learning experiences while building community connections and spirit. Under the early years program they developed their playgroup Little Sprouts at the Creek, for children aged zero to five years, and their transition-to-prep program Steps to Prep at the Creek, offered in the year prior to commencing school. It is a core belief of the early years program that the children are capable, competent and active learners with the ability to make positive contributions to their school and the wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to the teachers of the early years program for the work that you are doing to ensure the students have playful experiences as well as interactions that promote active learning and engage children's natural curiosity. I congratulate Cedar Creek State School on their receipt of this grant and encourage them to keep up the amazing work they're doing.
