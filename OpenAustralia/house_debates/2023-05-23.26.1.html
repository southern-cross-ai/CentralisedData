        () (): Education is a fundamental building block for a better Australia. While it's what goes on inside the schools—the quality education, the curriculum and, most importantly, the teachers—that can make all the difference, being able to provide education in well-equipped modern facilities is also important.

        So I'm pleased to announce that the following schools in Boothby have been successful in the open round of the Schools Upgrade Fund: Hamilton Secondary College, for shade structures and maintenance; Black Forest Primary School, to upgrade existing outdoor learning space; Blackwood Primary School, for refurbishing classrooms;

        , for air conditioning and ventilation; IQRA Islamic college, for repairs and maintenance; Sunrise Christian School at Marion, for air conditioning and to upgrade an outdoor learning space; and, last but not least, Edwardstown Primary School, where I was pleased to welcome Minister Jason Clare last week. The student leaders—Phoebe, Luca, Louis and Emmerson—showed us the outdoor learning space that the students have been designing, and principal Vicky Bashford spoke about how the school was such a part of the local community, with generations of local families attending the same school. Her own mother attended the school, she's now the principal, and her daughter attended the school as well. Congratulations to those student leaders for their exciting designs. I can't wait to come back and see it in real life.
