       <p>
        I rise to recognise Leah Findlay, a local resident in my electorate of Robertson, whose inspiring commitment and community service has led to her being nominated as a finalist in the 2015
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Awards" rel="nofollow">
         National Youth Awards
        </a>
        , in the category of Youth Courage. Leah is legally blind. She is an outstanding role model on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and right across Australia, and she is a fantastic tutor and peer mentor for Indigenous students.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has completed an arts-law degree at the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and just last week started undertaking a PhD with a focus on the role of the media in criminal trials. Over the last four years at the university, Leah has volunteered in and assisted with a number of programs that lend a hand to other students, all while maintaining an excellent academic record. Her journey from Blackwall, on the peninsula, to university is a four-hour round trip every day, as she joins the tens of thousands of other commuters from my electorate who travel regularly to Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        At age 24, it is clear that Leah is a young woman with passion, commitment and dedication who is determined to help others. She is also very modest. She admitted to me that she is amazed by how far she has come and that she is very, very humbled by the nomination for youth courage. The awards will be presented on 16 April, during National Youth Week, so good luck to Leah and to all of the finalists, and thank you for your inspiring example to all of us.
