        It is 22 July 2018 that marks the centenary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranbrook_School" rel="nofollow">
         Cranbrook School
        </a>
        . The school started with 64 boys and has grown to become one of the great educational institutions of Australia. One hundred years ago, the founders of the school sought to create an Anglican school that would produce well-rounded individuals, giving the boys a range of academic, sporting and cultural opportunities to help them fully develop their personality. I attended Cranbrook under two inspirational headmasters: Mark Bishop
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
         OBE
        </a>
        , a distinguished scientist and one of the finest liberal educators Australia has produced; and Dr Bruce Carter AM, an outstanding leader of young men, who taught me Latin and gave me so many opportunities to develop my knowledge and leadership skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last century, Old Cranbrookians have enriched the nation and the world. Among their number are chief justices, soldiers, entrepreneurs, sportsmen, businessmen, scientists, artists and humanitarians. The school's motto, 'esse quam videri', means 'to be rather than to seem to be', which is perhaps why I'm only the second Old Cranbrookian to serve in this place, as it's a good preparation for life but a poor preparation for politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with any independent school, it's important to acknowledge the very great personal sacrifice of parents who choose to send their children to Cranbrook and to support the school through a wide range of other activities. I'm grateful for the education I received at Cranbrook and I will always be proud to be an Old Cranbrookian. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Headmaster Nicholas Sampson as well as the staff and students of Cranbrook. You have custodianship of an important tradition which stands for educational excellence and active citizenship. I wish you the best for your celebrations and good luck in the next century.
