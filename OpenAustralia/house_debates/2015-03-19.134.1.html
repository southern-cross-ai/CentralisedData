        The statistics around mental illness in this country are most concerning. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        , mental health and substance use disorders account for about half the total burden of disease among 10- to 24-year olds and suicide is the highest cause of death in the 20- to 24-year age range. With those figures, it is easy to believe that about half of all Australians will be touched by mental illness in some way at some point in their lives.
       </p>

        Headspace, which is a federally funded organisation, is helping to improve the health and wellbeing of young Australians and, as a government, we are committed to ensuring that they are given the right tools to cope during this peak period where mental health issues start to emerge. The National Youth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Foundation for people aged 12 to 25 and the Headspace centres provide support for young people and their families to direct clinical services, health promotion and community awareness activities. Headspace delivers support in four main areas: mental health, primary health, drug and alcohol support and vocational support. This includes confidential face-to-face counselling as well as online support at eheadspace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since its establishment in 2006, headspace has supported tens of thousands of young people. In the 2014-15 budget, the coalition committed an additional $14.9 million to support the expansion of the headspace network by 10 centres, to a total of 100 across Australia. I met with the board of headspace on Tuesday this week and I was impressed with their vision and plans to support youth affected by mental illness and deal with situations and issues where they need professional help.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that I believe is most important for the success of headspace centres is the inclusion of youth reference groups. Each centre has one of these groups that compromises young people who essentially make sure the centre is actually in touch with other young people. It is their role to advice on the look and feel of the centre as well as give ideas on how best to reach out to the community. The inclusion of these groups show the determination of headspace to really get an understanding of what young people want, how they feel and how best to deal with their issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted to inform the House that the official opening of a new headspace facility at Taringa, in my electorate, will take place tomorrow. I look forward to meeting the local team as well as members of the youth reference group. Young people in all communities deserve access to support and professional advice for the many challenges they will face in their teen years and into early adulthood. I believe the introduction of a headspace centre in Taringa will heave a positive impact in the local area. Moving away from home and starting university can be a massive step for some young people, and I am confident the new centre will provide additional support to students. Issues relating to mental health, drug and alcohol problems and physical health affect young people all over the country, and I am proud of our government's commitment to tackling these problems and providing support.
