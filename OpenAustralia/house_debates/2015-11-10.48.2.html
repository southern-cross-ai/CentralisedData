        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister please update the House on how the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement would increase two-way traffic between China and Australia, improving jobs and creating more growth?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. There is no doubt at all that the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement provides a world-class framework for an economic relationship between Australia and China into the future. What it will also mean, of course, is much more travel between Australia and China.
        </p>
        <p>
         In that context, it is exciting to note that in September, for the first time, China, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
          Hong Kong
         </a>
         , became Australia's No. 1 tourist market. More people came to Australia on short-term visits from China than from any other country, overtaking
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         for the first time. This demonstrates how strong and important the relationship that Australia has with China is going to be in the years ahead. Seven point two five million tourists came to Australia in the last 12 months—a record and over a million more than when this government came to office. So our efforts in promoting Australia as a market by providing world-class facilities for the industry are bearing fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is particularly significant to note that, immediately after the signing of the free trade agreement, Australia entered into a new air services agreement with China. That too was a landmark agreement. It will enable the Chinese airlines to essentially triple their services to Australia over the years ahead. There are a large number of Chinese carriers that have expressed an interest in coming to Australia or are already starting new services and in fact boosting the number of people who are able to travel between our countries. But it is not just Chinese airlines. I was excited to read and to learn that Jetstar are beginning services from Wuhan to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast
         </a>
         on 787 aircraft—direct tourism between China and the Gold Coast. So there are going to be real benefits to the entire Australian tourism industry as a result of this closer relationship with China.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, that is going to mean new facilities in Australia. It was a pleasure to be with the member for Ryan for the opening of the new upgraded Brisbane international terminal just last week. There is work happening, obviously, in other terminals as well: the new T4 terminal in Melbourne; T1, a new pier for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Perth Airport
         </a>
         ; and work on runways in Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane.
        </p>
        <p>
         These sorts of things demonstrate that our airlines and our aviation infrastructure are preparing for rapid growth in our tourist industry. We expect to have 1½ million tourists here next year. China will be the biggest market for those visitors, but all of them are contributing to building a stronger Australian economy, with $13 billion expected next year.
