        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe Valley
        </a>
        are in our thoughts today as they wrestle with the challenge of bushfires.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important bill today. This is a piece of legislation that Labor welcomes. The provisions in the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2013 were contained in the Veteransâ€™ Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. As a consequence of that it should not be a surprise to the House that Labor supports this bill seeing as, of course, we wrote the original.
       </p>
       <p>
        The previous bill was introduced into the 43rd Parliament in June 2012. As you may recall, it passed the House of Representatives on the 22 August 2012, and in the normal manner was thereafter introduced into the Senate, in fact on the same day. However, the previous bill had not passed the Senate at the time when the parliament was proroguedin August of last year. As a consequence, it lapsed. I will briefly talk to the House about the effect of this bill that is now before the House. As I say this is a bill that Labor supports.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are several purposes of this bill and I will speak to them briefly. Firstly, it is to amend the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 so that the payment of travel expenses for treatment may be approved by the Repatriation Commission before or after the travel has been undertaken. This clarifies provisions relating to advance payments for travel expenses and makes some minor clarifying amendments. Further, this bill amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the VEA to allow for special assistance or benefits under these acts to be extended to those who would not otherwise be eligible by way of a legislative instrument made by the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission or the Repatriation Commission, respectively, rather than by regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the bill amends the VEA to extend the application of debt recovery provisions to cover legislative instruments made under the VEA. It also renames the War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920, the Protection of Word 'Anzac' Regulations 1921. It amends the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 to extend entitlement for benefits under this act to

        between 13 and 19 January 1993. It also amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRCA" rel="nofollow">
         MRCA
        </a>
        to clarify that various references to written determinations are legislative instruments and to replace references to 'disallowable instrument' with, instead, 'legislative instrument'.
       </p>
       <p>
        It amends the MRCA to replace references to telephone and pharmaceutical allowances with reference to payments of the MRCA supplement. It amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        Act 1991 to correct references to section of the VEA. It amends the VEA to correct references to sections of the

         SSA
        </a>
        in regard to eligibility for attendant allowance. Lastly, it amends the VEA to align definitions of various forms of maintenance income with those that are now contained in A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments proposed by the bill are primarily technical in nature, as my summary would clearly reveal, but adds flexibility for the payments of some veterans' benefits, extends coverage, makes definitions consistent across Social Security and Veterans' Affairs legislation, improves debt recovery coverage and corrects errors, which are all worthy goals. There are some small differences between this bill and the previous bill, the original bill introduced by Labor, and it would be remiss of me to not make some brief remarks about those.
       </p>
       <p>
        One difference between the 2012 and 2013 bill is the exclusion of regulations to make reimbursements of pharmaceutical costs and treatment costs for Australian participants in British nuclear tests tax-exempt. The government has said these amendments are not necessary and, of course, for that reason they are not included in this bill. We have elected on this occasion to take the government's undertakings in that regard in good faith. But, be under absolutely no misapprehension, if this is in fact nothing more than a disguised attack on entitlements of veterans and the ex-service community and their families, Labor will be vigilant. If this is in fact a disguised savings measure, Labor will be vigilant. There is no greater responsibility for government than the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. With that comes a profound responsibility for caring for those who have offered the courage, commitment, and indeed sometimes the sacrifice that is required to deliver that protection. The Australian community is proud of our veterans and ex-service men and women. All those who choose a career in the armed services are heirs to a great tradition. Those who choose to serve give a commitment to protect their nation and its interests. It is understood that we owe it to them to ensure their service is recognised, that the nation's gratitude is clear and that they are looked after in their times of need. I am delighted that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is resolved to bring this legislation back to the parliament and ensure that this Labor legislation is passed. I would humbly submit that he was very lucky to inherit it.

        <p>
         I rise to speak on the Veteransâ€™ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2013. I can report to the House that this bill does contain a number of minor technical amendments. It is important that legislation be kept up to date to ensure that it supports the efficient but fair delivery of services to military veterans and their families. In this speech I do want to, with a bit of indulgence, digress a little from the bill before the House to talk about some other important measures the previous government and we as the coalition government have put in place to ensure that the Centenary of Anzac is commemorated and celebrated appropriately as well as to talk about some measures in my own electorate of Riverina. Veteran and military matters in general are very important in my electorate given that the army recruit training battalion has its base at Kapooka, just south-west of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
          Wagga Wagga

         , and at

         , just east of Wagga Wagga, is the Royal Australian

         base, which also encompasses an important Navy installation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill includes amendments to clarify the longstanding practice by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Veterans' Affairs
         </a>
         of providing post-travel authorisation for travel expenses associated with treatment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. The Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 provides for eligible nuclear test participants to receive treatment, including testing for cancer. That is very appropriate and must be done. It also includes amendments to ensure that authority for regulations that protect the use of the word 'Anzac' are more readily identifiable by renaming the War Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920 to the Protection of Word 'Anzac' Regulations 1921. Inoperative provisions of that will also be repealed as a matter of good legislative housekeeping.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Riverina has long paid its fair share to the nation's war efforts. The region's association with Australia's Defence Force really began with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
          World War I
         </a>
         and even before that with the

         war, which began in 1899 and continued until 1902, was the war that encompassed Federation in 1901. Certainly the spirit of Anzac forged at Anzac Cove at Gallipoli does live on in the Riverina not just through current and serving Air Force,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_and_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Army and Navy
         </a>
         personnel but indeed through all of the people of the Riverina and the veterans. Many went through the Defence facilities at Wagga Wagga. Because Wagga Wagga is such good and central place to live, with Canberra just 2Â½ hours drive and being halfway between Sydney and Melbourne, our major capital cities, they retire in Wagga Wagga. It was recently announced that, as a result of the Suncorp Bank's analysis, Wagga Wagga is now considered the most family-friendly city in Australia bar none. Canberra was there, but not quite up with Wagga Wagga. I note that the member for Canberra is nodding in approval. It is a good place for veterans to spend their retirement because it has good health amenities and a number of specialists and it is close to Canberra. With so many great Centenary of Anzac events happening in and around the War Memorial, Wagga Wagga is a central place for veterans to live and be able to enjoy the wonderful amenities and facilities that Canberra has.
        </p>
        <p>
         The spirit of Anzac was certainly on display again at the recent launch of the centenary of the Kangaroo March in Wagga Wagga in my electorate on 7 December 2013. This does relate to veterans and to this legislation. There were many veterans there. The event was attended by the

         in his capacity as the chairman of the Centenary of Anzac commemorations in New South Wales. I add my congratulations and the congratulations of the people of the Riverina to General Cosgrove on his nomination to be Australia's next Governor-General.
        </p>
        <p>
         The launch of the Kangaroo March re-enactment was well attended by hundreds of locals and many veterans. They got into the spirit of things with period costumes. All of this bodes very well for the Riverina's engagement in the re-enactment that will take place in 2015 to commemorate the centenary of the largest march of the World War I marches held that year. Both Rhondda Vanzella and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Brown" rel="nofollow">
          Graham Brown
         </a>
         of Exeter, the President of the Kangaroo March Centenary Re-Enactment Executive Committee, played a wonderful role in that launch.
        </p>
        <p>
         A highlight of the commemoration of the centenary of World War I will be the re-enactment of the Kangaroo March. It will take place from Wagga Wagga all the way to Sydney. The original march took place on 1 December 1915 with 88 men and concluded at the Domain in Sydney on 7 January 1916 with a 222-strong party. One of those brave 88 men was Private Edward John Francis Ryan of Tumut, or Jack as he was affectionately known. After joining the Kangaroo March in Wagga Wagga,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
          Jack Ryan
         </a>
         was deployed to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         with the 55th Battalion. He was a recipient of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         for conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty during the allied assault on the Hindenburg defences on 30 September 1918, just weeks away from the armistice.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the Anzac Centenary locals from the Tumut region, including the nearby towns of Adelong and Batlow, are looking to erect a life-sized statue of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
          Private Ryan
         </a>
         in his home town. An application will be made as part of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants funding allocation of $125,000, alongside many worthy ideas from the Riverina electorate as to how best the community can remember the effect the so-called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
          Great War
         </a>
         had on our region 100 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do acknowledge the fact that the previous government put forward this idea to have $100,000 spent in each and every one of the 150 lower house electorates to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. I am pleased that the coalition added another $25,000 to that very noble funding gesture of the previous government, and I know that all members would join with me in saying that this is a very worthy way of commemorating a very important eventâ€”one which actually forged our nationhood. When Gallipoli occurred, we had only become a nation 14 short years earlier as part of a federation of colonies. Certainly that did more than anything to forge our nationhood and that wonderful spirit that we Australians have.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further to this, some Riverina residents have applied to the ballot to attend the 2015 Anzac Day commemoration service in Gallipoli. I note the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Advertiser" rel="nofollow">
           Daily Advertiser
          </a>
         </i>
         , my local newspaper, told the story of Mr David Gill of Wagga Wagga, who served in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Air Force
         </a>
         for more than 30 years and who has applied as part of the ballot process. Mr Gill told the
         <i>
          Advertiser
         </i>
         the Gallipoli campaign tells him of the 'heroism, the endurance and the suffering of people that fought for our freedom'. And he is right, of course. He said he was going to visit Anzac Cove in Gallipoli one day regardless of if he wins a ballot ticket or not. I hope that he does.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Gill is like many Riverina residents for whom the Anzac Centenary and the stories of gallantry and bravery of people such as Jack Ryan of Tumut embodies what the centenary is all about. Certainly another one of those is my good friend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
          John Sullivan
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Old Parliament House
         </a>
         . Mr Sullivan, who is a councillor on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrandera_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Narrandera Shire Council
         </a>
         despite being an octogenarian, is also heading the Anzac grants committee for my electorate. This committee comprises 28 people who are also very passionate about making sure this commemoration is celebrated and commemorated in the right way throughout my very large electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also note the ministerial statement issued today by Senator the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ronaldson" rel="nofollow">
          Michael Ronaldson

          New Zealanders
         </a>
         for this important occasion in our nations' collective histories.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Riverina has a strong historical connection to the Defence Force, which the Anzac Centenary will highlight, the Defence Force continues to play an important role in the life of the Riverina, with Wagga Wagga being the only triservice regional city in Australia. Our local community has a special insight into the service given by the men and the women of our Navy, our Air Force and our Army, so we understand the vital importance of supporting our veterans and recognising the unique nature of active military service. And this bill goes to that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Fadden, the Assistant Minister for Defence, in his 12 December second reading speech on this particular piece of legislation, said:

         Amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act will make it clear that the Repatriation Commission may approve or authorise travel for treatment, before or after the travel has been undertaken.

        <p class="italic">
         Further amendments in the bill will enable special assistance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to be delivered in a more timely manner.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This will be achieved by enabling special assistance to be provided by legislative instrument instead of by regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is something that veterans have been calling for and that is something that the coalition will deliver.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The result will be a more streamlined and therefore quicker process for providing special assistance to veterans, members, former members and their dependants.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is so crucial because many of these people for whom this legislation is so important put their lives on the line for this nation, and there can be nothing more important for this parliament to do than to look after those people who, through acts of courage, through acts of devotion, through acts of sacrifice, put their lives on the line every time they put on the uniform.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Amendments in the bill will update the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as a consequence of the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act and will replace obsolete references to pharmaceutical allowance and telephone allowance in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.

         Minor amendments will also ensure that the Veterans' Entitlements Act debt recovery provisions will be applicable to all relevant provisions of the act, the regulations and any legislative instruments made under the act.

         The remaining amendments in the bill will make minor technical changes to Veterans' Affairs and related legislation.

         Although relatively minor, the amendments in the bill will clarify, update and improve the accuracy of Veterans' Affairs legislation.

         While not the subject of this bill, it is important to note that the coalition has committed to restoring advocacy funding to 2010 levels, adding $4 million to funds available over the forward estimates. This supports the principle that veterans often prefer to speak to other veterans who have a keener insight into their experiences when they need help or advice. It has also committed to new indexation arrangements for military pensions paid to superannuants aged over 55 under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefitsâ€”DFRBâ€”and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefitsâ€”DFRDB.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is important legislation, and I am sure that Labor, while also recognising the importance of veterans to our nation going forward and in the past, also recognise that this is legislation that needs to pass this House. I commend the bill to the House.

           Peter Cosgrove

He and his family have had a very long connection to Canberra. In fact, my late mother-in-law taught his children at a Catholic primary school on the north side of Canberra. He has had a very long connection to Canberra, and we very much look forward to welcoming him to Yarralumla. Again, I would like to congratulate Peter Cosgrove on his appointment to Governor-General.

          I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill tonight, because this amendment was first introduced under Labor in 2012, by my colleague the member for Lingiari, who was then the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The amendments contained in this bill will update and improve the operation of many aspects of the existing veterans affairs legislation.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the changes made in this bill is to clarify arrangements for the payment of travel expenses for medical treatment for veterans and their carers. The bill makes it clear that travel undertaken for medical treatment can be approved by Veterans' Affairs either before or after the travel is undertaken, removing the pressure on veterans to get their travel approved in advance of their treatment. Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you can imagine, in the lead-up to medical treatment, a person often has higher priorities than travel approvals. In 2012-13, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
           DVA
          </a>
          processed over 165,000 claims for reimbursement for travel expenses for treatment purposes. This change will be welcomed by those veterans and their families. Other changes include replacing obsolete references and repealing redundant definitions that currently exist in this legislation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although the amendments in the bill will primarily give effect to relatively minor measures and technicalities, it is, nonetheless, an important bill. It is important because the role of government in supporting veterans is important. The government has a fundamental role in maintaining and enhancing the wellbeingâ€”be it physical, financial or emotionalâ€”of veterans and their families. It is also the role of government to be the leader in acknowledging and commemorating those who served Australia and its allies in wars, conflicts and peace operations and to preserve Australia's wartime legacy.
         </p>

          I would like to echo the sentiments that were expressed by my colleague the member for Riverina on the Anzac Centenary grants. I am very much looking forward to meeting with my panel later this month. I have just appointed the judging panel to assess the applications for those grants. The Canberra community has been keen in making many applications for those grants. I encourage Canberrans to make more applications. We have had applications from a wide variety of groups and community organisations. I particular encourage Canberra schools to get on board on this project. It gives them the opportunity to commemorate our efforts in

The panel is drawn from Defence; the ADF; the war widows; and the junior cadets, the youth development organisation. I have historians and a range of people on the panel and I am very much looking forward to meeting them later this month.

          My father-in-law is a Vietnam veteran and, by all accounts, came home a changed man. So I know a little about the unique challenges faced by veterans and their families, and I want to talk about some of those challenges today. Some of you may have read the Fairfax feature on post-traumatic stress disorder that was published over the weekend, called 'The silent war'. If you haven't read it yet, I strongly suggest you do. The feature, beautifully written by Scott Hannaford, is both a powerful and a sobering insight into the world of returned soldiers, peacekeepers and police officers suffering
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
           PTSD
          </a>
          . It details the feelings of guilt, from having left friends behind; of grief, from having lost friends and colleagues; of fear, from having witnessed so much horror; and of shock and trauma at the transition from service back to peacetime existence. The feature also serves as a warning to Australia, to our leaders, to our governments and to our people. I quote:

         <p class="italic">
          With Australia's decade-long war in Afghanistan coming to an end, all but a handful of the troops are returning home. For most who made it back in time for Christmas it will mean a welcome return to the routines of family life and work. For others, it will mark the start of a new, silent war that they cannot return from, played out in the homes they find themselves unable to leave, medically discharged from the jobs they love in their early 30s, and wracked by night terrors, panic attacks and isolation

         <p class="italic">
          There is a large wave of sadness coming our way, and the system - DVA and Defence - needs to be ready for it. I wonder whether we are?
         </p>
         <p>
          PTSD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in Australia. The Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health says that between five and 10 per cent of Australians are likely to experience PTSD in their lives, while up to 12 per cent of serving and ex-serving members will be affected by PTSD in any given year. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Veterans Affairs
          </a>
          , or DVA, says that 1,713 veterans of recent conflicts are suffering from PTSD, and that, of those, 955 are veterans of either Afghanistan or Iraq. However, in reality, this number is likely to be much, much higher. Many sufferers develop symptoms years after their service, and many more remain undetected because they never seek the help they need to treat their PTSD. Of Afghanistan, General Cantwell says, 'We have exposed thousands of young and old Australians to some pretty brutal experiences.' He says the numbers of returned soldiers suffering PTSD will 'grow, and grow exponentially'. As policymakers, we must be ready. It is our responsibility to ensure that the system, Defence and DVA, is ready. Families, too, must be ready and aware of the risks of PTSD.
         </p>
         <p>
          One thing Scott Hannaford does very well in 'The silent war' is detail the fact that PTSD affects not only returned service personnel but their families as well. He tells the story of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Clark" rel="nofollow">
           Rebecca Clark
          </a>
          , who calls herself a 'second generation veteran'. Rebecca has never been to war; she has never had a gun pointed at her face, never had to take a life or endure any of the other unspeakable horrors of combat. But as the daughter of a Vietnam veteran, Rebecca not only had to deal with her father's undiagnosed PTSD and the resulting volatility, temper and mood swings but she herself developed PTSD in her early 20s.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know from the experience of my husband, Chris, that the life for families of soldiers can be difficult. When my father-in-law toured Vietnam he left behind his wife and five children, all under the age of 10, at Woodside Barracks in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          . Woodside is in Inverbrackie in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
           Adelaide Hills
          </a>
          . By 1970 there had reached a fever pitch in terms of the moratoriums and the protests against the war. There was a lot of hatred towards the war and, unfortunately, towards anyone who was associated with itâ€”including the wives and children of those serving.
         </p>
         <p>
          Chris tells of how he, his brothers and his sisters and other Defence kids were bullied and vilified at school, as were their mothers whenever they went out to the local shops. My husband has a vivid memory of his mother putting the bins out one night. Traditionally his father had put out the bins, and this was a dark night. Chris was there in bedâ€”he was only littleâ€”looking out the window, incredibly worried about his mum out there in the dark night on her own putting out the bins. It is just one of those little childhood fears that we all have, but I think it highlights how children are acutely aware of the fact that they have a parent at war. And they also have a heightened sense of danger and responsibility in the absence of that parent.
         </p>
         <p>
          As our soldiers return from Afghanistan, I urge family and friends to be on the lookout for signs of stress in their returned love one, and amongst themselves. Some signs of PTSD to watch out for include: trouble getting along with colleagues, family or friends; angry or violent outbursts; increased alcohol or drug use; more physical complaints than usual; and poor performance at work. There are a number of community organisations, such as Solider On and Young Diggers, and there are also a number of Defence and DVA programs that are designed to assist in this transition. I urge returning soldiers and their families to make the most of these.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, there is also more that we as policy makers can do. I am particularly proud of a body of work that I was part of in my first term, which was the
          <i>
           Inquiry into the care of ADF personnel wounded and injured on operations
          </i>
          , done through the Defence Subcommittee as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The inquiry was a comprehensive body of work which involved hours and hours of discussions and hearings with people from all over Australiaâ€”with families, with veterans, with medical professionals, with public servants and with serving soldiers. Most importantly, we heard evidence of terrible hardship and unhappiness among our service people. These are people who have fallen through the gaps, despite the best efforts of the ADF, Defence and DVA.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report that resulted from the inquiry covers a broad range of areasâ€”from the immediate action following an injury; aeromedical evacuation, which focuses on some of the activities that we were getting involved in in Afghanistan; rehabilitation and support following physical injury; mental health concerns, including PTSD; return from operations; and post-service issues, including DVA and veterans' support structures. The report highlights a number of gaps in areas where we need to be doing more to support the health of our returned service people. These include mental healthâ€”and specifically female veterans' mental healthâ€”and improving communications between Defence and DVA in the management of post-service transition. They are just some of the areas.
         </p>
         <p>
          There has been progress and recognition of the need to support those with mental health issues. Steps have been taken to make improvements in streamlining the DVA and Defence processes and streamlining the information on injured soldiers.
         </p>
         <p>
          We, as a committee, were impressed by the work done by Major General Cantwell and by community organisations such as
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_On" rel="nofollow">
           Soldier On
          </a>
          and Young Diggers, who work in the area of mental health and who are doing great things in changing the culture of stigma and shame that still exists in the ADFâ€”sadly, resulting in returning soldiers ignoring the signs of mental health issues and other injuries. I would just like to take this opportunity to commend those organisations. I went to the launch of Soldier On, which was just down in Manuka here where the old RSL club was before it was burnt down. There was a tremendous spirit of energy and commitment amongst the men and their families who established that organisation to actually help returned soldiers. I commend Soldier On and Young Diggers and other organisations and groups that are established to help returning Vets who have PTSD and which also assist with their mental health issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report also highlights the post-service life adjustment and how hard it is for a wounded or injured soldier to adjust from being a highly-skilled member of a professional forceâ€”a warrior, so to speakâ€”to a seemingly constrained civilian. The inquiry grappled with this issue. In our report we have highlighted the need for greater continuity in the transition from Defence to DVA, and we have recommended expediting or streamlining information technology connectivity and a unique service veteran health
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
           ID
          </a>
          number. That is extremely important, and it is a theme that ran through a number of the presentations in the inquiry's hearings. DVA still faces dissatisfaction from the veteran community, although we found the department is doing much to improve client service, particularly in having a single point of contact for case managementâ€”that was particularly important, and that was a point made very strongly by the Defence Families Associationâ€”and in moving to a single electronic claim process and free treatment for PTSD, depression and anxiety.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have recommended that the department try to be less prescriptive, as well as monitoring its performance through periodic publication of claim-processing times and claim success rates. This will need constant attention, but I hope that the work of the committee will help to bring about improvements and make for better lives for our service people and their families after suffering physical or mental health injury.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am proud to be associated with the inquiry and with the report, which was tabled in June last year. I urge the government to respond to the recommendations outlined in the report as a matter of urgency. As the 'wave of sadness' approachesâ€”to use Major General Cantwell's phraseâ€”it is all the more important that the government does everything in its power to ensure we are ready.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is impossible to exaggerate what we owe to our service personnel. In thanking them for their efforts and showing our gratitude for the work they do in securing our nation and preserving our democracy, we have to ensure that we provide the highest standard of care for them upon their return.

           I rise today to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2013, which aims to update and improve the accuracy and operation of veterans' affairs legislation and help to improve efficiency in veterans' affairs matters.

           I have spoken many times in this place about the importance of fair indexation of Defence Force retirement benefits, DFRB, and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits, DFRDB, military superannuation pensions. My office has been contacted by many members of the veterans community asking what the coalition is doing for military superannuants. In my electorate, I represent many groups, including the

           in Enoggera.
          </p>
          <p>
           The defence community and the veterans community want fair indexation, and I was honoured to be one of the many coalition members to sign the pledge in 2012 that says: 'The coalition will ensure DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as age and service pensions'. All DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will benefit. I am proud to stand on this side of the chamber with my coalition colleagues, who understand and value the contribution by veterans to our great nation, where we have pledged our commitment to the fair indexation of military superannuation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The previous Labor government promised in 2007 to give a fair deal to ex-service men and women and subsequently had six years in which to deliver a fair go for our veterans. But they simply chose to break their promise, refusing to repay the loyalty that veterans have given to all Australians. The coalition took to the 2010 election and again to the 2013 election a policy that would see the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB. Under the coalition government's policy for fair indexation, 57,000 military superannuants and their families will be better off. This is set to be delivered and funded in the government's first budget, with the new measures to be effective from 1 July 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
           In June 2012 veterans received the news that military superannuation pensions would increase by just 0.1 per cent, as opposed to the 0.9 per cent increase announced in March 2012 for age and service pensions. Many veterans received an increase of less than $1 a fortnight, a shameful action as the cost of living increased and Labor introduced an economy-wide carbon tax. Sadly, Labor ignored the veterans community when they introduced the carbon tax, providing a household assistance package to pensioners, low-income individuals and families and students, while veteransâ€”men and women who fought for our countryâ€”did not receive a cent of assistance. How disgraceful is that!
          </p>
          <p>
           As all Australians know, the coalition government is committed to the repeal of the carbon tax, having already introduced a bill, only to have it blocked by Labor and the Greens. It is obvious that Labor and the Greens do not care about the high cost of living for Australian families and for Australia's veterans, otherwise they would respect the mandate the Australian people gave the coalition government at the last election, and support the repeal of the carbon tax.

           The coalition government is determined to repeal the carbon taxâ€”and reduce the cost-of-living pressures for all Australians, particularly veteransâ€”and to fairly index veterans' DFRB and DFRDB, because that is the right and just thing to do. It is just and right because of the enormous contribution that these brave Australians have made. It is just and right because when a nation asks its service personnel to go to war, to put themselves in harm's way, we as a nation have an overwhelming obligation to provide proper support on their return. It is just and right because it is the Australian way.

           Already the coalition government has been working to improve services to our veterans. In December last year the Minister for Veterans' Affairs officially opened the new premises of the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health at the University of Melbourne. The coalition government is committed to addressing mental health challenges facing veterans and ex-service personnel. The

           is in a collaborative partnership with the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health and the Department of Defence. This is a partnership which is vital in helping the coalition government deliver the support that our veterans need and deserve. This support will be based on research and testing of the best available treatment available to veterans and their families.

           In late 2013 the Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced grants to help improve veterans and defence community life. Through the Veteran and Community Grants program, $410,000 was put towards upgrades to Men's Sheds and many other veterans and defence community organisations. Since 1999, the Veteran and Community Grants program has helped ex-service organisations continue to provide high-quality services and support to the veterans and defence community and their families, as well as assisting in attracting the next generation of members.

           All Australians can be justly proud of the service and sacrifice of our veterans and those currently serving in the Australian Defence Force. Ex-service and community organisations, veterans representative groups, and private organisations and projects that promote improved independence and quality of life for veterans are eligible for funding through the Veteran and Community Grants program. Two of the eight Queensland grants were given to the Defence Force Welfare Association Queensland branch, incorporated at Enoggera, which provided funding to sustain the association's quarterly newsletter project which is sent to the many veterans and ex-service personnel living in my electorate.

           I have seen the vital role veterans and defence community organisations play in providing a central hub of support, recreation and comradeship for so many of our current and former service men and women. I have seen local Men's Shed groups grow in both membership and size during my time as a

           councillor and now as the federal member for Ryan. I am also delighted to see Men's Sheds team up with other community groups to assist with local projects. Recently, the Bellbowrie Men's Shed group assisted the McIntyre Centreâ€”a horse-riding school for disabled children and individuals to develop confidence and social skillsâ€”by moving a fence from an old horse paddock in a block of land being redeveloped. This was a great demonstration of a local developer working with worthy not-for-profit community organisations on a project that benefits local families.

           The Centenary of Anzac commemoration is an important time for us as a n ation to look back on the significance of Anzac and an opportunity for us to understand where we fought and , importantly , the reason we fought. The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Prog ram is an integral part of the c oalition g overnment's commitment to the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. Through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program the Ryan community has the opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice that epitomises the Anzac spirit. With Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, the Ryan electorate has a strong and proud association with the defence forces.
          </p>

           I was delighte d to hear of the news that the c oalition g overnment has announced an increase in funding available for the l ocal g rants p rogram by $25,000 for each electorate. This will mean that communities across the country will now have up to $125,000 available to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac . This increase will ensure that local community groups are given the opportunity to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the men and women who served our country, and to the families they left behind.

           I have been meeting with the Ryan Anzac Centenary Committee to discuss how best to commemorate this important time. I have already received n umerous applications for grants for a wide range of community projects representing different aspects of Anzac spirit and the pride we have for those who served our country. I h ave been working with the Ryan committee which consists of

Mr Cameron has taken the initiative to develop an Anzac commemoration program with the local schools in the Ryan electorate.

           services Mr Cameron has spoken about the members of our community who have served, from 1914 to the present day. As such, he believes that the community should have the opportunity of understanding and reflecting on the stories of our local veterans, past and present.

           Mr Cameron and his wife , Cathy , were at a local garage sale a few months ago, where a wide range of different items were being sold as part of a deceased estate. One of the ladies at the sale asked if anyone knew anything about
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
            World War I

           , as she was selling some artefacts and wanted to know a little more. Mr Cameron looked at the medals and other items she hadâ€”which, as it turns out , had a ll belonged to her great uncleâ€”and convinced her not to sell any of them. Her great uncle was 27 when he enlisted in August 1914; he landed at Anzac Cove on the 25th of April and was killed in action just three weeks later. The lady also had her father's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           history, as a Lancaster pilot.Â  Mr Cameron was rightly excited that all of this history was discovered simply by chance at one address in Kenmore â€”a history of war, a history of service to our nation. This is when Mr Cameron approached the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch with a view to celebrating the Centenary of Anzac by having our local schools research our local veterans. With support Mr Cameron then took the concept to the local schools in Ryan. As a result , through the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch , there is a competition for local schools to research the veterans from the Kenmore-Moggill district. The intent is to have year 10 students research those veterans who are no longer with us while the primary schools will research our living legends. The end product will be a history of our community captured as a printed publication in addition to a web based virtual history.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr Cameron informs me that students have enlisted the support of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives" rel="nofollow">
            National Archives
           </a>
           and the University of Queensland, as well as advertising in the community to uncover local stories. It is exciting that while communities across Australia will commemorate the centenary of Anzac in many ways, the program Mr Cameron has developed involves the community working to understand its history, resulting in an end product that is an enduring legacy that benefits the whole community and future generations.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch has arranged to award three prize winners for the best research from the year 10 and primary school students. While this is only the first year of Mr Cameron's project, he envisages t he concept can be adopted on a n ational basis over time. I look forward to working on this project to assist and promote community awareness in any way I can, and I look forward to seeing this plan expanded across other Australian communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           I a m proud of the commitment this g overnment has made to our v eterans.Â  I am proud of these veterans â€”heroes all â€”who put themselves at serious risk in the defence of Australia and the freedom we all enjoy. We must never begrudge this support an d never forget their sacrifice.
