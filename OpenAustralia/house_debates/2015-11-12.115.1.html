       <p>
        Today I rise to tell a great Australian story, one which unfortunately ended far too prematurely. Last weekend this country lost a great man, husband, father, grandfather, entrepreneur, philanthropist and friend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Philip was born on 29 September 1951 in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodd_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Rodd Point
        </a>
        and was the second child of Tom and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Salter" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Salter
        </a>
        . Phil ended up with five brothers and sisters, and the family home was always busy. In 1975, he met the love of his life, Christine Westhoff, and a year later they were married.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the following years, like his parents before him, Phil and Christine had six beautiful children and, once again, like his parents before him, their house was always busy. I can verify that firsthand from the many times I have visited the Salter house.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the day Phil was born, until the day we lost him, family was always the most important thing in his life. He was a family man first and foremost, from start to finish. Phil was also a proud old boy of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patricks_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Patricks College
        </a>
        , Strathfield, and it was there he met his lifelong mate and eventual business partner, Peter Mattick.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1979, Phil and Peter, along with Phil's father Tom, backed themselves and started a business in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Regents Park
        </a>
        . They named the business Salmat—'Sal' from Salter and 'Mat' from Mattick. From those humble beginnings they grew that business to one that now operates in four countries and, at its height, employed 7,000 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phil and Peter stepped down from their joint managing directorship of Salmat in 2009 and focused together, as always, on their private business interests. These interests were varied, but Phil's passion became farming. He was a keen farmer with his Doughboy Angus brand of cattle and a strong believer in putting back into the land. Whenever he was heading to one of the farms, he preferred to take as many people as his car could fit. That way you had no choice but to listen to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash" rel="nofollow">
         Johnny Cash
        </a>
        and Johnny Cash only—and of course Phil's accompanying synopsis of what made Johnny Cash so great.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phil and Peter were keen supporters of sports, particularly rugby and athletics. They sponsored up-and-coming kids, whole clubs—and even codes, if that what was needed at the time—both privately and through Salmat. Phil was a particularly proud supporter of Indigenous sporting teams and frequently came through with gear, transport and accommodation when and where it was needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few years, Phil fought valiantly to stave off cancer—a fight he would ultimately lose; however, he never lost his sense of humour. On the way back from looking at a property only a few months ago when the cancer was starting to really bite, he asked his colleagues if he thought the site may convert to residential. When the answer came back 'maybe in 20 years or so', he quipped, 'I'll be 83!' and everyone started laughing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with his humour, he was a great and willing raconteur who always held the crowd. He loved telling stories that related to his dad Tom and he could always work one of his dad's sayings into most situations that left the crowd in raptures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school motto of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pat's" rel="nofollow">
         St Pat's
        </a>
        at Strathfield is: Luceat Lux Vestra, which means let your light shine. As a fellow old boy, I know how seriously the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Brothers" rel="nofollow">
         Christian Brothers
        </a>
        took teaching us what this meant. If there was ever an example of someone who let their light shine, it was Phil.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to pass on my family's heartfelt condolences to Phil's wife Christine; his mother Mary; his children, Daniel, Andrew, Anna, Dominic, Richard and Juliet; his son- and daughters-in-law, Alexander, Emily and Amelia; his grandchildren, Henry, Charlie, Matilda, Portia, Sebastian, William and Edward; and his siblings, Michael, Kathy-Anne, Carl, and Jane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being of Irish descent, I thought it would be appropriate to conclude this tribute to the life of Phil Salter with an Irish blessing. Phil:

        May the road rise up to meet you.

        May the wind always be at your back.

        and rains fall soft upon your fields.

        And until we meet again—

        May God hold you in the palm of His hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rest in peace, Phil.
