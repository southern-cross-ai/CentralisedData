       <p>
        If you go down into the heart of Macnamara you will find the magnificent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine_of_Remembrance" rel="nofollow">
         Shrine of Remembrance
        </a>
        . It's a great and fitting tribute to the men and women who have served our country, and it stands there to celebrate and to thank those who have given the ultimate sacrificeâ€”including many who, even in their time in Australia, had conditions and settings put on them that were unfair, like our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        service men and women, who served our country even without the right to vote in this country; and, of course, our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTIQ
        </a>
        service men and women, who, up until recently, had to hide their identity as part of their service to our defence forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why, in their latest exhibition, the Shrine of Remembrance was celebrating the LGBTIQ service men and women who participated and served our nation. I think it was a wonderful tribute to those who have been often sidelined and those who have faced difficult circumstances. Unfortunately, as part of that exhibition, many of the staff at the shrine have faced threats of violence and threats of intimidation by members of the public, and they had to cancel a display of pride at the Shrine of Remembrance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would just say that in Macnamara we are so proud of the shrine and we are proud of all of the men and women who have served our defence forces. Regardless of their race, gender, sexuality or whoever they are, we are proud of them, and we thank them for who they are.
