        My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister update the House on recent developments in Europe with regard to avian influenza? What action has the government taken to address these issues?

         I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Weekend reports of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1" rel="nofollow">
          H5N1
         </a>
         , on a poultry farm in France are alarming because it is the first case of the deadly disease in domestic fowl in the European Union. This is in addition to 17 other European countries that have reported the H5N1 virus.

         .

        <p>
         Late last year the Australian government coordinated Exercise Eleusis, to test Australia’s ability to respond to a simulated outbreak of the avian influenza in poultry. Our response arrangements proved to be effective and sound. A detailed report is currently being prepared and will include a number of recommendations to further strengthen our preparation. Australia recognises the risk posed by migratory birds. However, the vast majority of birds coming to Australia are shore birds and not waterfowl, which have been responsible for the spread of H5N1 in other parts of the world. Nevertheless, surveillance of migratory birds is vital to Australia’s protection from a bird flu outbreak. To date, more than 10,000 samples have been collected from wild birds but show no signs of the virus. In addition, the quarantine service has completed further surveys specifically for that pathogenic avian influenza as part of a surveillance program across Australia’s north. At the same time, surveys are undertaken throughout Australia’s south. Farmers, wildlife networks and agricultural departments across Australia are also alert to report any suspicious deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
         In summary, although naturally we can never guarantee immunity from H5N1, all Australians will be confident that research, surveillance, monitoring and planning currently in place are providing Australia with the best possible chance of protection.
