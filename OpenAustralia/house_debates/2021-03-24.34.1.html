        than the return of our country shows with champion rams, blue-ribbon cakes and 'animals made out of fruit and veg' competitions. On Saturday, the program began in Mayo with the Mount Pleasant Show, at which, thanks to the lovely weather, we had one of the biggest crowds ever. I think everyone was so excited to finally mingle on a large scale, and I was delighted to see so many faces and chat with so many people that I haven't had a chance to talk to in some time. I would like to give a shout out to Suzie and Shirley from the Coloured Sheep Owners Society. They taught me the ancient art of felting. Congratulations to Sienna and her brother, Harry, from Bridgewater. They won blue ribbons for their pet bantams, Snowball and

        Later in the year we will have more country shows in Mayo. We will be at Yankalilla, Strathalbyn,

        , Kingscote, Callington and Uraidla. As well, I will be hosting stalls at the Willunga Almond Blossom Festival and fairs at Meadows and at Houghton. This Saturday, we have the Mount Barker Show, and I welcome everyone in our community, right across Mayo. Come out to the Mount Barker Show. You'll love it. I need to practise my skills. I will be in the goat-milking competition again. There are some things you learn as a federal MP, and I can tell you that it's much easier to milk a cow than it is to milk a goat, because they're so close to the ground.
