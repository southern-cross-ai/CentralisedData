       <p>
        It is with great pleasure that I rise this morning to pay tribute to my incredibly hardworking colleague and friend, Amber-Jade Sanderson, who is a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Council
        </a>
        for the East Metropolitan Region located in Morley, which is in the northern end of my federal electorate of Perth. Not only is Amber-Jade an incredibly hardworking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_House" rel="nofollow">
         Upper House
        </a>
        member of our state parliament she is also the candidate for the state seat of Morley in the upcoming
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        state election.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as local and active go, they do not get much harder working or much more local than Amber-Jade, who grew up in Morley and went to school in Morley. She went to John Forrest Senior High School, and I am told her tales of a misspent youth include hanging around and spending time at the local shopping centre, the Morley Galleria, which those in my electorate will know very well; as well as at the Morley bus station, which is right alongside it. Amber-Jade is now raising her own family, with children Chloe and Hugo, in Dianella. Happy birthday to Hugo, who has just turned one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amber-Jade has devoted her entire life to fighting for those most vulnerable in our community, with a particular focus on those who work in the disability care sector. Amber-Jade was elected to the Upper House in 2013 to represent the people in the East Metropolitan Region and since that time, four years ago, she has been flat strap getting things done for residents in the northern suburbs. To name but a few of her achievements so far, she has spent the last four years getting clean water for residents in Noranda and she has brought together small businesses in Morley, making sure that they have every opportunity to thrive and promote themselves, and to employ others in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amber-Jade has been tireless in holding the government to account over the privatisation of the Midland hospital and the lack of available services there, together with the Liberal Party's broken promise in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Perth_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Perth Hospital
        </a>
        . Amber-Jade has put together a plan with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         Mark McGowan
        </a>
        to improve public transport in the Morley area, with Metronet, and to combat traffic congestion.
       </p>
       <p>
        She continues fighting alongside myself and others to make sure that we get better internet in Noranda and Morley. I have already spoken in this place in relation to the steps being taken to mobilise the community to finally get them the national broadband network that they so desperately deserve and need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, Amber-Jade is working tirelessly with residents in the Morley and Noranda areas to improve their lives and make them that little bit better. Amber-Jade could have stayed in the upper house, but she has done an incredibly brave thing to put herself forward. She will resign her position there to contest the state's seat of Morley. She is hitting the ground running, she is working hard, she is with a united team and she is by far and away the best representative for the state seat of Morley.

         Before I call the member for Deakin, if no member present objects, three-minute constituency statements may continue for a total of 60 minutes. Being no objection that will happen. I call the member for Deakin.
