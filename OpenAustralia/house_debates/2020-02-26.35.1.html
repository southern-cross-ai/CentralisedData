        There were cheesy smiles all round at the Little Creek Cheese factory in Wyong, when the 2020 Sydney Royal Cheese &amp; Dairy Produce Show results were announced. The Central Coast's very own cheese factory in my home town, Wyong, Little Creek Cheese gained one gold, two silver and five bronze awards, in what was a very competitive event.
       </p>
       <p>
        This family owned and operated handmade artisan cheese factory has been winning awards every year. This year they landed eight awards out of their 10 entries. Gold this year went to their club cheddar with cumin seed and silver to their club cheddar with peppercorn, and also their yogurt cheese balls with garlic and thyme. The bronze awards went to their club cheddar with fig and walnut, club cheddar with bacon,

        cheese, marinated goat salad cheese with garlic and dill, and marinated salad cheese, Aussie bush.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue Parsons, cheesemaker and owner, said, 'We are so proud of what we are producing right here in Wyong.' Her husband, Russell, said, 'We have been making award-winning cheese less than an hour from Sydney. This is the way cheese should taste. We make it with passion and love.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The Little Creek Cheese factory is open from 10 am to 4 pm every day and has viewing windows to see the cheesemakers in action. This year they've introduced bookable experiences to show off just what they do at home in Wyong. Located within the Wyong Milk Factory, Little Creek Cheese is a must to visit. I want to congratulate Sue and Russell for their most recent achievements.
