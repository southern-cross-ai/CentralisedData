       <p>
        I rise today to celebrate the life of a true local champion from my electorate of Longman, Michele Rigger, who was sadly taken from us last week—I missed her funeral today because I'm here in parliament—by the scourge of sepsis. It wasn't expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        I knew Michele for a long time. Twenty-odd years ago, when I first started at the Caboolture Football Club, she and Moorsy, as we affectionately knew her, would serve us drinks after the game, and they always had a friendly word. Her commitment was second to none. She was rewarded by being given a life membership of the Caboolture Football Club, and she was also instrumental in the startup of the Caboolture Sports Club, which is the biggest club in Queensland, 22 years ago. She volunteered there for that entire time. She'll also be remembered for her tremendous work in her foster kids Christmas drive. I remember that, when I first got in, she was the first on the phone to say, 'Terry, you need to put your hand in your pocket to make sure that these kids have got presents on

        ,' which I was more than happy to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michele is one of those people in her community who will be sorely missed. I want to thank her and her husband, Glenn, and their two kids and numerous grandkids for the contribution that Michele made.
