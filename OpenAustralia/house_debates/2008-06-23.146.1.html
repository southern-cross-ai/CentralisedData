        I welcome the funding of $74,500 to restore the historic

        in my electorate of Swan. During the 2007 federal election campaign, I pledged to pursue the federal government for funding for the Old Mill, after recognising that the 172-year-old building was in dire need of repairs.

        John McGrath and I supported funding for the local landmark, as it was falling into disrepair. I believe it is critical that such a historically significant building be preserved for future generations. The funding that the mill has received will be used to repair its windmill sails and for general maintenance. The windmill is one of two that was built by William Kernot Shenton, who was one of South Perth’s first residents. The first mill was ransacked by

        in 1834; the present mill was then built in 1835 by millwrights Paul and

        . It is also WA’s oldest industrial site. In the late 1950s, the mill was in danger of being demolished for the construction of the

        is a very historically significant landmark in Perth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and, whilst the funding is most welcome, both South Perth MLA John McGrath and I will continue to pursue both state and federal governments to provide further funding for more improvements and ongoing maintenance at the Old Mill. South Perth Library and Heritage Manager Susan Marie and the City of South Perth Historical Society have developed a proposal for the mill that includes an interactive resource centre for the community, which I believe is a fantastic idea that the government should look into funding.
