       <p>
        I am rising to pay my respects to a formidable lady who passed away. Hope Marland, a stalwart of the Queanbeyan community in my electorate, recently passed away at the age of 91. Hope was one of those tireless doers who are energisers in their communities. She was a local Queanbeyan councillor for 30 years and capped off that career as deputy mayor. She was the first female president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Local Government Association.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you had a problem she was one of those people that you automatically thought of to go to and seek advice. She was a member of countless community groups, including Legacy, the hospital auxiliary, Rotary, the Queanbeyan Children's Special Needs Association and the Karabar Cooperative Housing Association. For her many activities over the years, she was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        and an AM. She was honoured with a pavement stone on the Crawford Street Honour Walk in Queanbeyan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hope was also a stalwart of the local Liberal Party and that is how I best knew her. Indeed, she was the Liberal candidate in the seat of Monaro in the 1976 NSW state election. She was unsuccessful in that bidâ€”one of her few hiccups in a stellar career of success. Indeed, it is tiring just listing her achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, she was a cherished wife, mother and grandmother. My particular condolences go to her husband Ken. Vale Hope Marland.
