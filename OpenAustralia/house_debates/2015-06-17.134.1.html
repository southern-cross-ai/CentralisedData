        In December 2013, a local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        family received the worst news any parent can receive. Their otherwise healthy seven-year-old boy, James, was diagnosed with a high-grade brain tumour. The parents were clearly in shock and could not come to grips with the reality of the situation. In short order, young James had been operated on by Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Teo" rel="nofollow">

        in Sydney for his brain tumour. That occurred in February. From being a healthy boy in December with a normal life expectancy, he went to having this very invasive brain surgery in February. It was not to be the answer; it was to give him time. He was then required to have further surgery, again by Charlie Teo, on 16 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        They came to see me, and the first point I want to make is how generous our community was because it is incredibly expensive. The hospital and Dr Teo wanted in excess of $80,000 within 48 hours for this surgery to take place. The Sunshine Coast community rallied and within four days had raised $125,000. Sadly, in the last fortnight, young James lost his battle for life. His heart simply gave up. He had been in Germany where, thanks to Rare Cancers Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Vines" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Vines
        </a>
        and the support of this community, he was able to travel for what was experimental treatment. It actually worked, as I am advised. However, a secondary tumour came back and, as I said, unfortunately his little heart could no longer cope.
       </p>
       <p>
        His family—Paul and Deborah and their daughter, Millie—now tragically mourn the loss of James. But he was only one of about 200,000 Australians living with rare or less common cancers. These are difficult stories, and it is only through the good work of Rare Cancers Australia that they are given hope. When a child is struck down with a brain tumour or anyone else is struck down with a rare cancer, it is very important to know that every single step that possibly can be taken is taken. It gives the family some hope and also some satisfaction to know that no stone was left unturned. The tragic ending of James's life means that all of us in this place next week can participate with Rare Cancers Australia as they meet in the Mural Hall to share with us some of the insights and the challenges facing these 200,000 Australians. I would encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber to join us at 6 pm in the Mural Hall to learn more about rare cancers and what we can do as parliamentarians to support these 200,000 Australians.
