        I rise today to speak about a fantastic not-for-profit organisation in my electorate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        Cancer Help is an organisation that is dedicated to supporting people diagnosed with cancer in the local community. Since 2005 more than 400 people from areas as far as Blacktown to Katoomba have received support from Blue Mountains Cancer Help. In the last 12 months alone, this not-for-profit organisation has provided 2,387 subsidised therapies including massage, lymphoedema, oncology massage, acupuncture and reflexology as well as support groups and counselling for clients and their families and carers. These therapies promote relaxation during a very challenging and often life-changing experience. All therapies are subsidised by Blue Mountains Cancer Help and if necessary can be carried out in the client's home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blue Mountains Cancer Help goes above and beyond to support their clients and the local community. They have implemented a buddy system to support the primary carer or family member and also assist with the transportation costs, which can be considerable when regularly travelling throughout the Blue Mountains. What makes this organisation so unique is the way that they engage with their clients and the local community. In their own words, they 'provide a sense of purpose, friendship and support' to clients and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Community engagement has extended beyond just providing therapies and support. Blue Mountains Cancer Help have opened up op shops in the Blue Mountains townships of Blaxland and Katoomba. These shops provide a regular source of income, as well as a source of fundraising events and donations. There are two particular fundraising events that I would like to draw attention to, as I think they are amazing and truly demonstrate just how unique this organisation is.

        In May this year I attended the 2012 Blue Mountains Cancer Help Arty Bra Auction. The works of art bras are indeed something to behold. This auction raised more than $10,000 in much-needed funds. The solid chocolate corset was auctioned off for close to $3,000. One of the volunteers I met with at the event, Lynne, told me about the next fundraising endeavour: she would be undertaking the Camino walk across Europe. I am delighted to tell you that Lynne commenced the almost 800 kilometre walk just last week and is keeping a highly entertaining blog on the Blue Mountains Cancer Help website to keep us up to date. I would like to read from her blog:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's run with those bulls in Pamplona. After a long hot walk we arrived in Pamplona and for the first time we saw people. Pamplona was abuzz with the festival and paella. I cannot believe they run those bulls through the streets here, it is absolute madness.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you would like to make a donation to support Lynne or Blue Mountains Cancer Help, you can do so by attending one of their op shops or going to their website.
