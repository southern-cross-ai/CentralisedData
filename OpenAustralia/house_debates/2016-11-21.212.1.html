        Last week, I had the privilege of visiting Community Support Frankston to see them in action and to see the full extent of services they have provided Frankston and the surrounding community for the last 48 years. Community Support Frankston is staffed entirely by volunteers, four days a week, with just a few paid staff on the managerial end. Indeed, it has one volunteer who has been there for the entire 48 years altogether. Last financial year, over 13,000 hours were volunteered to support Frankston's most vulnerable people experiencing financial hardship, homelessness, domestic violence, mental illness and family breakdown, amongst other things. They coordinate emergency funding for people as a last safety net, have a mobile shower service that visits one day a week, have stocks of nonperishable food and are an endless resource of knowledge for other services that people can be referred to if they are unable to meet the needs of the clients themselves.

        When I visited, I was amazed at the extent of the work of Community Support Frankston and it is a relief to know that they, among other organisations, are there for those who fall through the gaps of the welfare system. I am grateful to

        for taking the time out of his busy day to show me around the centre and for all the work that he and everyone at Community Support Frankston do. I was proud to have been able to secure a funding grant for them prior to the election and I look forward to working closely with them for the benefit of our community.
