        I rise today to talk about the Margate CBD in the Petrie Electorate. The Margate CBD is soon to become a lot safer, thanks the coalition government's Safer Streets Program. The government is delivering on its commitment to address crime and antisocial behaviour in all of our communities. Under the Safer Streets Program, the Margate CBD is receiving $170,000 for the upgrade of closed circuit television systems. These systems will provide a physical deterrent to counteract antisocial behaviour. They can provide a clear image of offenders in action and may assist police in making arrests. It is a known fact that fewer incidents of crime occur when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        systems are installed in a premises or nearby.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst these systems do not reduce crime completely, they do force criminals to rethink their actions or choose, perhaps, a different target. At around Anzac Day this year, I was down in the Margate CBD doorknocking some of the local businesses. Unfortunately, three of the local businesses—Big Dad's Pies, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        and the local Thai takeaway—all had their windows kicked in, in the couple of weeks before I was there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses need to be able to invest with confidence in their shopfronts. We know that to run a successful business we need great customer service and good products and services. But we also need to be able to invest in our shopfronts to make them look fantastic. A strong risk of people kicking in windows would, I believe, stop people investing in their shopfronts.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will work with the local council to make sure that these CCTV systems are placed in great spots. We need local businesses like those that I mentioned to continue to invest in their businesses to help grow the local economy and to create more jobs. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our community, and the small business owners in the Margate CBD in the electorate of Petrie will soon have the confidence to close their doors at night knowing that they have the added protection of CCTV.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to be part of this government that is committed to helping local communities deliver effective solutions to crime hot spots and anti-social behaviour throughout all our electorates. Every business owner should feel confident to invest in shopfronts, and the community should feel safe to walk the streets all the time.
