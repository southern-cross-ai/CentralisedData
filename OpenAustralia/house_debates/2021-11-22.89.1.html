        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister claimed he didn't ridicule electric vehicle technology. Given the Prime Minister said electric vehicles would end the weekend, would not tow a trailer and would stop Australians from going camping, why did he claim he did not ridicule the technology when he made these statements on

         As I've made patently clear on numerous occasions, whether here in this place or in other places, what I opposed at the last election was the Labor Party's policy. We had our own policy on electric vehicles, and most recently I've announced what our policy is, as part of our broader lower emissions technology and future fuels program, to ensure we meet the commitments we've set out most recently at

         26. We know what our targets are. We know what our plans to achieve those targets are. When we were last in this place a few weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition thought the election was going to be on 11 December. In fact, he told everybody on his backbench that that is when it was going to be. Yet he still can't even tell them what their 2030 target is. He still can't tell them what all the sneaky taxes are that they're going to put on the Australian people. He thought the election was about to happen, and he still couldn't tell anybody what was going to be going on. There's one thing that's pretty bad, and that's when Labor tells you what they are going to do; what's even worse is when they don't tell you.
