        On Saturday 14 November, I opened my phone to a message from my daughter-in-law Romee. Usually, it is a quick photo of my granddaughter Sophie. This one showed her sleeping peacefully with another toddler friend and included a special message: 'After all the misery today, we choose to focus on our children and hope for a more peaceful future.' This, indeed, was a beautiful, yet powerful, message. The last 12 months have been difficult for so many, but in addition to having a deep and passionate nine-year connection to France, Romee lost her close friend Tori in the Lindt cafe siege in December last year.

        As a result, I decided to put a condolence book in my officeâ€”a small symbol of our support for the people of France, who are showing that such horrendous attacks will not depress their spirit. After the media announcement for contributions, I was asked in an email why condolence books are necessary, why some countries and groups get them and others miss out and why, for example, the French deserve a condolence book but not the victims of the floods in Myanmar or the countries in Africa who have lost thousands to Ebola. I could completely understand this constituent's care and love for humanity, and my response to this was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reason for the French initiative is that the attack on France was aimed at disrupting a country that is not at war. It only has troops involved in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        peacekeeping activities. France was a significant birthplace of an individual's freedoms and a fight against class dictatorship. A condolence book is a symbolic gesture of support for the French as they fight against acts of terrorism. The tragedies you speak of are a terrible loss of life, and the people are just as worthy of our heartfelt compassion, but the circumstances differ.

        Our local paper reported on Milton resident Kate Douglass and her husband, Laurence. They are living in France near the 11th district, close to the bars and restaurants hit by the devastating attacks. Kate is currently researching liver and breast cancer at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_Institute" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Thankfully, they were away. Kate has said, in true Aussie style, 'I'm scared of what this will do to Paris, but I'm not scared to live in Paris after the attacks and I won't stop enjoying my life here.'

        France normally celebrates the third Thursday in November with fireworks, music and a festival. The event is called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaujolais_Nouveau_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Beaujolais Nouveau Day
        </a>
        . In my electorate of Gilmore, at the home of Jean-Stephane and Heather Estival a small but enthusiastic group of French expatriates and French language students met together to acknowledge the day. They all signed the condolence book, as they too empathise with the people of France. I have spent a short time in Paris visiting the Louvre, touring, enjoying the sense of art and adventure and just soaking in the art of this most inspiring city and wonderful nation. I will be presenting the condolence book to the French ambassador next week. My heart goes out to all those affected by any act of violence, terrorism or extremism. It simply is not fair to the citizens of that nation.
