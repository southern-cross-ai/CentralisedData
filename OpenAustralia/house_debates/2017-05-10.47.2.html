        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is it fair that a millionaire will receive a $16,400 tax cut while every other Australian has to pay more tax?

         How is it fair to sell out low-paid workers at Clean Event and trade away their penalty rates? How is it fair to promise parents of disabled children that there is a National Disability Insurance Scheme and never fund it? How is it fair to go to an election with a financial plan that involved flinging $16½ billion of additional deficits and debt on the shoulders of Australians? The Labor Party has no concept of fairness. This is the party that claimed to be in favour of needs based funding. So eloquent was the Leader of the Opposition! He said only today, 'For me it's not about, in education, the government system or the non-government system; I believe in a sector-neutral approach which prioritises needs based funding,' and yet he delivered exactly the reverse.

            , or I will have to deal with them. I recognise that it is the day after the budget and I might have a busy day. The Leader of the Opposition is correct to say it was a very short question, but the Prime Minister is in order when he is referring to the concept of fairness.

                 There is nothing fairer than telling Australians the truth about the public finances of their country and ensuring, as we have in the budget, that there are the funds to deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme and to be able to say to the parents of disabled children, 'The money is there,' and not as you did—you ranks of serried hypocrites, all of you—you never put the money in place. Dripping with empathy—hypocrites to the last degree.

                     Mr Speaker, the opposition have perpetuated this myth that they are the party of empathy. They claim to be fair. They want to be fair to Australian students. Well, why don't they tell parents the truth? Why don't they tell them that they never implemented Gonski? They never delivered a needs-based system. They said they did but they didn't, and they know they didn't. They talked about the National Disability Insurance Scheme and never funded it; we have. We have delivered. We told the truth. We have brought the budget back into balance. The forecasts are stronger than ever. We have raised the money and made the tough decisions. This budget is fair. Labor has failed on fairness, just like the Leader of the Opposition failed the members of the

                     </a>
                     on fairness. This is a fair budget—one that delivers the opportunity and the security. And the only thing that matches the anxiety of the Leader of the Opposition is the energy of the member for Grayndler in the press gallery today.

                        I thank the honourable member for her question. The member for Gilmore was a school teacher. She has not only been a school teacher; she has trained schoolteachers. She knows that this budget delivers the needs-based funding that Australian schools and Australian students need, the needs-based funding that the Labor Party never delivered and the needs-based funding that
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gonski" rel="nofollow">
                         David Gonski
                        </a>
                        recommended. They took David Gonski's name in vain and plastered it up all over the country—an exercise in massive hypocrisy, because they never delivered what he recommended. As Ken Boston said, Labor's education policy was a 'corruption' of Gonski's recommendations. No less than that.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This budget demonstrates our commitment to securing Australia's future opportunity and doing so fairly. We are dealing with the big issues that we confront fairly. So, we are fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are bringing the budget back into balance so that our children and grandchildren are not burdened with a mountain of debt. We are ensuring that we are making the big nation-building investments in infrastructure: the inland rail—$10 billion into rail—and the Western Sydney Airport, and another $1 billion into rail in Victoria. These are nation-building investments—
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
                         Snowy Hydro
                        </a>
                        2.0. These secure the future for our nation. They secure the economic prospects of our children.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We are guaranteeing Medicare—securing Medicare. Every year the Medicare levy and the amount from income tax that is required to pay for Medicare and the PBS will go into the Medicare Guarantee Fund—every year. That will be the law. Medicare will be guaranteed by my government, guaranteed by the coalition—and the PBS. That is our commitment: to give Australians the security they need.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We believe—we know—that in order to secure investment you need lower business taxes. And what we have done is reduce tax on small and medium businesses, and we will go further to make Australian business competitive. But we do not believe, as Labor apparently does, that paying tax is optional. Who will forget, at the end of 2015, when the Labor Party voted against the multinational tax avoidance measures? They voted against them. If it had not been for the Greens, the measures would not have got through the Senate. We stand for fairness, opportunity and security, and this budget delivers all three.

                         The member for Barton is warned. And members on both sides need to be mindful that I consider the level of interjections to be far too high and constant, and if I need to pause question time to deal with some members I will do so. I am giving fair warning right now.
