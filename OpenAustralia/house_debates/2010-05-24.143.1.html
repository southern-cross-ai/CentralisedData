       <p>
        It was my pleasure in April to officially open the Glen Huon Primary School’s multipurpose hall as part of the Rudd government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">

        program. The Glen Huon Primary School received $75,000 under the National School Pride Program and $850,000 under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for the 21st Century program. I would like to read to the House the statement that the students gave to me on the day and that they have asked me to pass on:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the students of Glen Huon Primary I would like to thank the Federal Government for giving us the

        &amp; Pride in our School money. This has enabled us to build this new hall, a canteen and to re surface our oval.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new hall has given students a place to go to during wet weather lunch and recess, and we have been able to play table tennis in here at lunchtime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now on a wet day our

        lessons can still go ahead.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have a proper space for our school assemblies, with a stage and audio gear.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have used the hall as a large Art space, a place for a drama and after school some one is hiring it to run African drumming workshops.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We now have a proper canteen, better cooking facilities, a proper place to serve food and a space where groups of lucky kids will be going to have cooking lessons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        None of these things were possible before.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The school has also managed to resurface our oval, and soon we will be able to play soccer and other games there. With our money we have also bought to 2 interactive whiteboards, got a set of Glen Huon sports tops, and done lots of repairs around the school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All the students are very grateful, and love the ‘new look school’ we have..
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you very much.
