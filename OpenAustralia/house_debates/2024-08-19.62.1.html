        My question is to the Prime Minister. On Sky yesterday, the Minister for Industry and Science said the government was issuing visitor visas from terrorist controlled Gaza because it was faster and less rigorous. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Refugee visas take longer and given what's happening right now and the dangers presented, the view was to try and get people out as quickly as you can.
       </p>
       <p>
        Isn't this why Australians are disappointed in the Prime Minister and are now saying he is incompetent and dishonest?

          Mr Speaker, I defer to your earlier ruling that you made at the request of the Manager of Opposition Business about language in the House. Had you not made that ruling at the request of the Manager of Opposition Business, this question probably would be something that's within the parliamentary debate and the back and forth, but the opposition asked that this sort of language be ruled out. I recommend it is.

          <p>
           I want to deal with character descriptions in general because this is a feature that keeps coming up time and time again, particularly with descriptors. I'm going to address the issue of character descriptions in questions. These have been ruled out of order in the past, including by myself, and they're not appropriate. From now on, just so that everyone's clear, there will be no words in questions ascribing a character reference to a minister or prime minister. I'm giving clear warnings. I'm following earlier practice that was done by previous Speakers. I've taken this approach on 1 August. Speaker Smith took this approach on 18 March 2021, and Speaker Jenkins took this approach on 2 June 2021. Just so that everyone is crystal clear, including the Leader of the Opposition, if you put a character description at the end of the question it's going to be ruled out of order and we will move to the next question. Okay?

            director has very clearly spoken about the responsibility that politicians have with their language. He knows that full well. He also knows the diligent way that our security agencies do their jobs. He should also know the risk of serious division that the ASIO director-general has warned about.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am also asked about interviews on Sky News. I hope that he also saw Mariam Dawwas, a Gazan refugee, in an interview with

             Tom Connell
            </a>
            and Andrew Clennell. She had this to say: 'It was a long journey. We were hopeful that we would come to a place of peace. We are here in Australia, living here. It was a very, very hard experience. I lost my dad. We lost our dad during the war because of a lack of medical care and we weren't able to get him to the hospital.' She went on to say: 'I have lived my life in Gaza. I don't have any political affiliation with any of the political parties in Gaza.' She went on to say: 'I am myself a journalist. My sister is a doctor. I have a dentist brother and a dentist sister. So I am aware we are not the exception. We are normal people in Gaza, very normal people, not terrorists.' She went on to say very clearly: 'I wouldn't support killing civilians in any way, so I was against what happened on 7 October.' This is a real human being with real family here.
