        I rise to talk about a very sad and tragic event that took place last week, and that is the passing of Dr Paul Collier, at the age of 46. Those of us from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        knew Dr Collier as a tireless worker and advocate for the disabled in South Australia. Paul will be remembered for his great achievements and for his advocacy work for those less fortunate, including those with disabilities. He will also be remembered for his passion and perseverance. All of us here who are members from South Australia, on both sides of the House, who knew Paul knew of his hard work, his passion and perseverance and his advocacy on behalf of all people with a disability. Paul will be dearly missed by all in South Australia, especially by the disability sector. He was absolutely committed to social justice and very passionate about ensuring that there was improvement to the lives of people with a disability. Our deepest condolences go out to Paul’s mother, Mrs Wendy Collier, and his sister, who will be feeling the hurt more than anyone at this moment. They can be extremely proud of Paul’s work and achievements, his commitment to the disability sector and his tireless efforts in bettering the lives of those with disabilities. Paul was also a candidate for Dignity 4 Disabled in this Saturday’s state election; I am sure he would have done extremely well.
