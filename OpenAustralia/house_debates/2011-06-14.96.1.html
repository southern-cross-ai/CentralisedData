        <p class="italic">
         That this House:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) notes:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) that 20 June each year is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Refugee_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Refugee Day
         </a>
         , celebrating the courageous spirit and resilience of more than 10 million refugees around the world;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) that the global theme for World Refugee Day 2011, occurring in the year of the sixtieth anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Refugee Convention, is '1 refugee without hope is too many.';
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Australia's history of support for the United Nations Refugee Convention and its objectives, being the sixth signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention which brought the convention into force in 1954, and having since welcomed 750 000 refugees who have made an enormous contribution to the culture, economy and social fabric of Australian society;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) that much of the political, media and public commentary in Australia regarding asylum-seekers and refugees misses or ignores the following facts:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) of the more than 10 million refugees identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
          UNHCR
         </a>
         ), just over 100 000 or 1 per cent are resettled under orderly programs each year, which means that if someone puts their name on a list today they could wait more than 100 years for processing;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) in many countries wracked by conflict, like Iraq or Afghanistan, there is no list or queue to join;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iii) Australia's 8250 asylum seekers in 2010 is a minimal number compared with the 358 000 people who sought asylum in the 44 major industrialised counties in 2010, and compared with the millions of people from Iraq and Afghanistan who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries like Jordan, Iran and Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iv) only two per cent of the world's asylum claims are made in Australia;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (v) persons fleeing from persecution are not 'illegals', they have a legal right under international law to seek asylum, and under the Menzies Government, Australia agreed to this by signing up to the United Nations Refugee Convention; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (vi) while Essential Research has reported that 25 per cent of Australians believe that 75 per cent of our migrant intake is made up of asylum-seekers, in fact only 1 per cent of Australia's annual migrant intake comes from them and even less from asylum-seekers who arrive by boat;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) notes the UNHCR report of April 2011 entitled
         <i>
          Back to Basics:
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right" rel="nofollow">

         and welcomes the forthcoming parliamentary inquiry into mandatory detention;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) recognises that it is possible to protect Australia's borders while also treating asylum-seekers fairly, humanely and in accordance with international law; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) calls for:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) a return to bipartisanship in support of a reasoned, principled and facts-based approach to the issue of asylum-seekers and refugees; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Australia to continue to work with other nations and the United Nations to address the complex global and regional challenges associated with increased numbers of asylum-seekers and other people movements that cannot be addressed by countries acting on their own.

          That this House:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (1) acknowledges the Government's failure to deliver on its promise to provide a computer for every secondary school student between years 9 to12 within the original budget commitment of $1 billion;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (2) condemns the Government for promising to families that they would not have to pay for charges associated with using the laptop computers, and then for breaking that promise by authorising schools to charge fees and levies to parents to use the laptops; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (3) calls on the Government to explain to families why it has broken its promise and why parents should be the ones to pay up to hundreds of dollars to make up the funding shortfall associated with the program, at a time when cost of living pressures are increasing.

          to move:

          That this House:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (1) acknowledges the importance of the role that non-government schools play in reflecting the diversity of Australian society and serving a broad range of students, including those from a variety of religions, social backgrounds, regions, and socio-economic circumstances;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (2) supports the continuation of a funding model into the future that distributes funds according to socio-economic need and which recognises that every non-government school student is entitled to a basic level of government funding;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to chose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non-government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process.

          <p class="italic">
           (a) its greatest concern at the

            SA
           </a>

          <p class="italic">
           (b) great concern that the reduction in subsidy will lead to escalating power prices for businesses of up to 100 per cent, recognising users will pay as much as $0.60 per kilowatt hour; and

          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (4) brings to the SA Government's notice that every other State and Territory in Australia which has off-grid generation systems for isolated communities supports a state-wide pricing policy;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (5) expresses support for the affected communities and recognises the public outrage expressed at a public meeting in Coober Pedy on Sunday 15 May 2011 attended by Senator Nick Xenophon, SA Legislative Council Member the Hon.
