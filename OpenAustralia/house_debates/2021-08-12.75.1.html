        My question is for the Prime Minister. People in my electorate of Fowler who have been attending churches, mosques and temples every week for most of their lives have not been able to go for at least seven weeks of this year. Isn't it true this wouldn't have happened if the Prime Minister had done his two jobsâ€”vaccines and quarantine? Australians are paying the price for the Prime Minister's neglect. Who is he going to blame this time?

         It is difficult that you can't get to your place of worship to be able to pray, whatever your faith might be. I note and acknowledge the faith of the member, which is well known to me. It is difficult, because those of us of faith draw great comfort from being able to pray with others, from being able to pray for each other and to do that together. Some of us like to come together in a place of worship to sing our songs of worship in one way; others do it in different ways. However you like to worship, good for you because it's good for the soul; it's good for the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank all the pastors, priests and ministers around the country, the imams and rabbis, the priests of whatever faith, who are out there encouraging those in their congregations, praying for them and giving support. And I thank all of those working in those faith groups who are providing those supports on telephone trees, who are talking to them about vaccination, encouraging them. I particularly want to thank the Pacific islands faith leaders, who have been fantastic in getting messages into their communities about the importance of vaccinations. This is a team Australia moment. This is a time when Australians come together and support each other and get the job done for all Australians. It is not a time for undermining. It is not a time for cheap politics. It is not a time for that type of partisanship. It is a time to focus on the job ahead and for all Australians to get behind that effort.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that in the United Kingdom, with a vaccination rate which is now over 70 per cent, the death rate right now is 104 every day. One hundred and four daily. Now, I know where I'd rather be. I know where Australians would rather be. They'd rather be in a country that has been able, over the course of this pandemic, to save more than 30,000 lives and get a million people back into work. That's what we've been seeking to do, working with governments all around the country from whatever political persuasion. But it does disappoint me that the only bipartisanship I can find in this pandemic comes from the state and territory leaders, not from that which sits opposite.
