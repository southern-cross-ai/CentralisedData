        On indulgence, I rise to announce that the remains of two Australian servicemen missing in action since 1966 in Indonesia have been found and have now been positively identified. In March 1966
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Special Air Service
        </a>
        patrolmen Lieutenant Kenneth Hudson from Brisbane and Private Robert Moncrieff from Newcastle were part of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        patrol conducting border security operations during the confrontation between the Federation of Malaysia and Indonesia. During a river crossing they were separated from the other members of their patrol. Despite extensive searches at the time, they were not found.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2008 the Army commenced an investigation to locate the remains of these two men. In 2009 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Armed_Forces" rel="nofollow">
         Indonesian Armed Forces
        </a>
        agreed to assist and a joint investigation and research team was formed. As a result of strong cooperation between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and the Indonesian Armed Forces,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNI" rel="nofollow">
         TNI
        </a>
        , and the commitment of serving Australian personnel and veterans the remains of these two Australian soldiers have now been found. In particular, we thank the local Indonesian people who helped the joint search team locate the burial sites.
       </p>
       <p>
        For 44 years the families and loved ones of these two soldiers have been left with uncertainty. Now their remains can be brought home to their final resting place in Australia. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones today as we honour the service of Lieutenant Kenneth Hudson and Private Robert Moncrieff.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been news reports today that a number of the remains of Australian soldiers who lost their lives at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fromelles" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Fromelles
        </a>
        in 1916 have been identified. The discovery of these remains and the work to identify them and to rebury them in a fitting Commonwealth cemetery has been an important task. I wish to inform the House that the government is currently in the process of contacting the relevant families. Obviously, for the families involved this will be momentous news and we will make a public statement once the families have been contacted.

         On indulgence, I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister. It is good that the Indonesians have been cooperating with us in the quest for the remains of these two brave Australian soldiers. I am sure that the discovery of the remains will be of some consolation to the families of Lieutenant Hudson and Private Moncrieff.
