       <p>
        I am pleased to announce the formation of the Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness Group. This bipartisan group is co-chaired by myself and the Hon. Jason Clare MP, federal member for Blaxland. The whole purpose of the group is to raise awareness of prostate cancer, which, sadly, claims the lives of over 3,000 Australian men each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in Australia, and the third most common cause of cancer death. It is estimated that there are around 120,000 men in Australia living with this disease. Prostate cancer does, however, have a good prognosis if detected early, when compared with other cancers. Through the establishment of this group, members of parliament will be better placed to raise awareness of prostate cancer amongst their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is something that I feel strongly about as a sister, a mother, a daughter and a wife. It is important that in my role as the elected member for Dobell that I do what I can to encourage all men to visit their doctor for testing. We hear a lot about women having health checks. I think we need to have more education for men and awarenessâ€”especially for people like my husband, who will not go to the doctor until the last minute. The Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness Group will work closely with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Prostate Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        of Australia to provide support and information to members of parliament in order to raise awareness about prostate cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last September, during Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, I had the pleasure of hosting the parliamentary Big Aussie Barbie. Following this event, the member for Blaxland and I took the decision to establish this group in order to provide a constant voice in parliament for those who are impacted by prostate cancer. I would like to thank the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lloyd" rel="nofollow">

        , the former member for Robertson and a great local member, who is himself a prostate cancer survivor, for his activism on this subject and his assistance in establishing this group. Jim stated:

       <p class="italic">
        I know from personal experience just how important early diagnosis is in the successful treatment of prostate cancer.

        And:

       <p class="italic">
        It is great news that a Parliamentary Friendship Group has been established within the Federal Parliament to continue raising awareness of prostate cancer, the treatment options and how best men can look after their own health.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge David Sandoe

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, and to thank them for their assistance in the establishment of this group. Recently, the member for Blaxland and I had the opportunity to catch up with Dr Lowe. Dr Lowe said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The development of this group will further strengthen Prostate Council Foundation of Australia's already strong links with the Federal Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We look forward to working closely with the group to raise awareness of prostate cancer in the community and to encourage men over the age of 50 to talk to their doctor about being tested.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness will formally be launched later this month and later this year we will still be hosting the parliamentary Big Aussie Barbie, which will return here to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . I encourage all my parliamentary colleagues to attend. In addition, members of parliament will be encouraged to take the parliamentary Big Aussie Barbie to their electorates in order to raise awareness of this disease and I look forward to working with my parliamentary colleagues to support the Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness Group. Together I am sure we can continue to raise awareness of prostate cancer and the many services available to help those who are impacted by this deadly disease. I have been talking to some of the bowls clubs in my electorate of Dobell and in talking recently with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Norah Head
        </a>
        we thought we might get a fundraiser up and running to raise money for prostate cancer. It was suggested that we call it 'Get out your balls for prostate'. I look forward to working with other bowling clubs because it is that demographic that tend to be diagnosed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to quickly make mention of a project that is underway by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Tuggerah Shores. Last Friday they had a fundraiser, and they are raising money for Elsie's Dream. The aim is to build a hospice for the terminally ill on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , which is something that is much needed. We want people who are very ill to be able to pass with dignity and respect.
