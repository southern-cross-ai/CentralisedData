        On Sunday, my daughter Octavia and I had the absolute pleasure of joining in the 50th anniversary celebrations of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle_College" rel="nofollow">
         Nagle College
        </a>
        , Blacktown, which was attended by a large number of former and current students, and members of the Blacktown community. In 1964 a small group of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_Sisters" rel="nofollow">
         Presentation Sisters
        </a>
        , under the leadership of Sister Mary Alphonsus Thearle, created Nagle Girlsâ€™

        . It took its name from the founding member of the Presentation Sisters,

        , who was a pioneer in Catholic education in Ireland and a leading light for women around the globe. She was declared venerable in the

        , on 31 October 2013, by Pope Francis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school opened in 1965, comprising two classes, one of year 7 to 9 students and one of year 10 students. The school was surrounded by bushland, but the grounds and buildings have had to be expanded to cope with the rapid growth in the area. In the ensuing years the school added the necessary buildings and enlarged recreation areas, as it continued to grow in numbers.

        Throughout the decades, Nagle College has seen the Blacktown community transformed from a rural one in Sydney's urban fringe to the sprawling and diverse metropolis it is today. As Blacktown has changed, so has Nagle College, developing into a vitally important educational institution in the region that is serving a large number of primary schools, including many in my own electorate, such as

        . Many of my friends went to Nagle College and had a fantastic educational experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Father Peter Confeggi presided over the celebration mass. He noted that from the very beginning Nagle College has been at the forefront of women's education in the Blacktown area. It is a proudly multicultural school. As you look over Nagle College on its presentation days, you actually see the make-up of Blacktown itself. I am so proud that the young women who are coming out of Nagle College are educated to be agents of change. Since its foundation, Nagle College has instilled the Presentation Sisters' philosophy of 'In Deed Not Word' in all of its students. As they say, it is easy to talk the talk, but you need to walk it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today Nagle College continues this tradition and is responsible for nurturing and inspiring thousands of young women and transforming them into confident young women looking to make a meaningful contribution to society. As Nagle College proudly and correctly proclaims:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today's Nagle College is a modern, well-equipped secondary school, serving a multicultural community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifty years of education at Nagle College is something to be extremely proud of. I thank the college for its service to our community and congratulate everyone involved with the school on this very special milestone. I also want to wish all the best to those who are completing their

        at the school, or have only just completed it. I know its fine tradition will continue to be combined with academic excellence. I want to thank the Principal, Mrs Delma Horan, all the teaching and support staff and all current and former students for inviting me to participate in such a magnificent celebration.
