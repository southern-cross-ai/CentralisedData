        hotspot traffic congestion survey indicates that six out of the 10 major areas of traffic congestion in Melbourne affect my electorate of Menzies either directly or indirectly. Some 18,000 people participated in this survey and it shows that the major areas of traffic congestion in Melbourne are in the triangle between

        , Greensborough, Doncaster and Templestowe. I see the member for Jagajaga here in the chamber. She would agree with me that Rosanna Road; Jika Street, which flows through into

        are all major areas of traffic congestion so far as Melbourne is concerned. It particularly affects my constituents and I know it affects the constituents of the honourable member opposite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Melbourne needs two major pieces of transport infrastructure. It needs the East West Link—and this government has provided $3 billion of funding, which is sitting on the table, to build that link—and it also needs the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Link" rel="nofollow">
         North East Link
        </a>
        . In the election campaign we committed funding for a feasibility study, which I understand was matched by the Labor Party. Therefore, we are looking for Labor in Victoria to get on board and look at how we can build both the East West Link and the North East Link.

        <p>
         I want to follow the remarks of the member for Menzies. It is correct that Rosanna Road is one of the most congested roads in Australia. The Rosanna Road-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia_Street" rel="nofollow">

         intersection was recently voted the second worst intersection in Victoria in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACV" rel="nofollow">
          RACV
         </a>
         red spot survey. At the last election Labor did commit $5 million towards a study for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Link" rel="nofollow">
          North East Link
         </a>
         . I am pleased that it was a bipartisan commitment. The Turnbull government did also promise $5 million. It is a matter of urgency that these funds are delivered by the Turnbull government to make sure that we get the feasibility study done, so work can start on looking at the best way the North East Link can be delivered. We need to look at its feasibility and the environmental impacts right across Melbourne's north.
        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term infrastructure solutions are also required to fix the congestion problem on Rosanna Road. It is certainly the case that local commuters know only too well the daily frustration and safety concerns. There are still far too many trucks using Rosanna Road. I want to acknowledge the advocacy of the Resolve Rosanna Road group, who have lobbied consistently for safety measures and improved infrastructure. Last month I wrote to the minister for infrastructure. I am still awaiting his response.
