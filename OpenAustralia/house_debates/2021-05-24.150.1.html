        Today I rise to pay tribute to the youth who live, study and work in the Calare electorate. Their infectious enthusiasm and the amazing things these achievers are doing in the community offer an inspiring example for us all to follow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoe Peters is a perfect example. Zoe is the captain of Denison College's Bathurst High campus and Bathurst Regional Youth Council's Youth Mayor. Zoe recently won the Lions Australia Youth of the Year quest from club level all the way through to the national final. She is already a wonderful advocate for positive outcomes for young people, so congratulations, Zoe. She was up against students from all over Australia, including the big cities. It's an outstanding achievement from an outstanding young woman.

This year's TEN4TEN program continues to demonstrate the leadership potential of the young people of Calare. I'd like to congratulate the 10 students who were selected to take part. Bonnie Murphy, of James Sheahan Catholic High, wants to give a voice to the voiceless. Charlotte Crome, from Blayney High, plans to become a teacher. Eliza Ward, from

Ellie Crawford, also from Kinross, wants to provide greater representation for regional communities—and I'm proud to be mentoring Ellie as part of this year's program. Gian Wynn, from Kinross, hopes to build the diversity of country communities. Hayden Bliss, from Molong Central School, wants to serve his country by becoming an officer in the

        Finally, I'd like to pay tribute to another outstanding young person from our community, Scott Vandenberg. Scott uses a wheelchair due to a degenerative genetic condition, yet he lives life to the full and has many passions, including skydiving, raising alpacas and photography—and also

       </p>
       <p>
        All of the young Australians I have referred to in this Chamber today have the admiration and thanks of our communities for the wonderful work they are doing and the example they are all setting. Our future is truly in great hands.
