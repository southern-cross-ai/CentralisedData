         Dick Adams
        </a>
        , the member for Lyons, at the Rocherlea Football Ground to announce a $250,000 project that will be used to support sport, boost public safety and prevent crime. The Gillard Labor government has granted the Safer Suburbs funding to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston City Council
        </a>
        for its Rocherlea Recreation Ground Gymnasium and Sports Facility project, which will be part of the Gillard Labor government's commitment to reducing crime and the fear of crime in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will involve the construction of a new recreation facility for the northern suburbs of Launceston which will be used to support community programs. I am also pleased that the Launceston City Council has allocated an additional $250,000. I thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Launceston" rel="nofollow">
         Mayor of Launceston
        </a>
        , Albert van Zetten, for his encouragement of this project. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Launceston City Council for its support in delivering projects that improve community safety. This project brings together the Gillard Labor government, the Launceston City Council, the Rocherlea Football Club and northern suburbs community groups in a common goal of providing a community facility that will be of great benefit to the local community. The project will be not only of great benefit to the local community but also of benefit to other groups. The new facilities will make the ground suitable as a venue for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Tasmanian_Football_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Tasmanian Football Association
        </a>
        finals. It is also sure to benefit local schools, community groups, families and the sporting community. The new facilities will encourage community participation in sporting activities and will build community spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a firm believer that to reduce crime we need to keep kids busy and this new facility will enable that to happen. I also wish to congratulate the Rocherlea Football Club on conceiving and developing this project. It represents their commitment to the community. Through this new facility the interaction of their club with community groups will grow and develop. This project will allow interaction between the Rocherlea Football Club, the Launceston City Council and local communities. It is a glowing example of how the Labor government can support and enrich local communities, and as a consequence it will improve the safety and involvement of all in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say that the Rocherlea Football Club have been fantastic. They run the Indigenous round of football in Tasmaniaâ€”the only sporting association outside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        that conduct an Indigenous round of football. They have made an absolutely great commitment to the community and they involve all of the community in every activity they do. I commend the Rocherlea Football Club.
