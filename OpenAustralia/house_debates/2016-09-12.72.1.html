        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answers to the opposition today. Just to be clear: before the election, did the Prime Minister tell the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney that taxpayer funding for the plebiscite was a matter for cabinet, or did he guarantee the funding? Which one was it?

           I can say this very clearly to honourable members that the government's position and my position has always been this: any funding provided to the yes-or-no case will be scrupulously equal and fair as it always has been with respect to referendums in the past—as it was in the republic referendum and as it has been in other referendums. It has always been scrupulously fair, and it will continue to be so.

            <p>
             The details, the nature, the amount, the terms of any such funding and the terms of the plebiscite are a matter for the cabinet. The cabinet will decide on that and then it will be presented through the party room processes and, following that, to the parliament. I look forward to the support of the Leader of the Opposition, because if he is committed to same-sex couples being able to have their relationships treated or regarded as a marriage then what he should do is support the plebiscite, because what we are doing is offering a clear and democratic road map that gives every single Australian a vote. Every criticism he makes of the plebiscite, which he once supported, demeans the Australian people.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can say it costs a lot of money—that is true. You can say it is unusual in our political experience—that is true. But that is not what he says. What he says is: Australians cannot be trusted to have a civil debate. That is what he says. He is basically saying that Australians are unable to have a civil discussion about a fundamental question. He demeans the people he claims to represent—he demeans their civility; he insults them; he disrespects them. What we are saying is: every Australian will have their say in this plebiscite and the nation will make a decision and the nation will respect it—and so should the Leader of the Opposition.
