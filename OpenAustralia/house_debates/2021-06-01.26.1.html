        and Singapore. Jonathan and his team are already taking advantage of the changes to employee share ownership schemes, announced in the 2021 budget. As part of our $500 million overhaul, employees are no longer required to pay tax on shares invested in the company they work for after leaving. For unlisted companies, the cap on the value of shares sold or lent to employees will increase to $30,000, up from the present $5,000.
