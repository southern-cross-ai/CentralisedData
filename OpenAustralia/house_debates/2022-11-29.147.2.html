        and to extend my deepest sympathies to her family and loved ones. Born in July 1943, she was lost to the nation on 5 August this year. Few Australians have had their voices heard around the world in the way that Judith did. At a time of great social and political upheaval Judith's voice was something that all generations were able to appreciate and enjoy. She was an extremely talented and accomplished woman who took the sound of Australia to the rest of the world as the voice of the Seekers.

        Judith's father was a World War

        Judith married her musical director, pianist Ron Edgeworth, and they performed around the world. After Ron tragically died of motor neurone disease in 1994, Judith became patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Australia association and worked tirelessly in promoting the charity. In 1995, Judith was honoured with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her services to music, a much-deserved recognition of her contribution to music in Australia and around the world. The significance of Judith Durham's contribution to the cultural life of this country cannot be overstated. She carried the early sounds of a nation finding its voice to the rest of the globe, and her passing is a great national loss.

           But it is one of great nostalgiaâ€”perhaps more my parents' era than my own. But I also think that, if you're watching any reflections on that period of time in this country, the soundtrack has to be the Seekers playing in the background. I've inherited many of my father's poor attributes, and one is a great passion for music and music history. I grew up with the music of the Seekers and other music from that era.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first thing I always reflect on in relation to the Seekers is that before the Seekers we had some excellent musical talent in this country but it was still international music, particularly from America and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           , that substantially predominated here in Australia. You see footage of the rare Hollywood celebrity or British music act that would come to Australia, and everyone would, of course, flock to hear the concerts and even to see them driving past, as when the Beatles came anywhere in the country. Adelaide has the same story as anywhere else about the city effectively coming to a standstill because that groupâ€”an excellent group but also one that had come across the tyranny of distance to Australiaâ€”was so excitingly embraced by the people.
          </p>
          <p>
           So in my viewâ€”a lot of people would perhaps dispute this and talk about other great entertainers from that era or just prior to that eraâ€”it is fair to say that the Seekers were the first truly globally successful Australian music group, particularly in the market of all markets, the United States. In their era, in the sixties, when you look at some of the competition they had, the fact that they were making it onto the charts and topping the charts at times shows that they absolutely were trailblazersâ€”led by the great
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Durham" rel="nofollow">
            Judith Durham
           </a>
           , of course, and her beautiful, beautiful vocals and also the lovely character and presence that she had on stage with her voice and, of course, the way in which she conducted herself at a time when a lot of musicians and entertainers were deciding to misbehave rather than behave to get attention and perhaps to meet the zeitgeist of being a rebellious entertainer in the 1960s. Judith Durham was a brilliant entertainer but also someone that genuinely made all Australians proud as sheâ€”with the Seekers and through her solo careerâ€”pursued and achieved such success and, of course, always came home to Australia and absolutely loved Australia. I think it was 1966 or 1967 that the Seekers jointly were the Australians of the Year. That, I think, is a fitting accolade and a demonstration of just how significant they were in our society at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
           The passing of Judith Durham really is the ending of an era. But it's also such a spectacular legacy that she leaves behind. All of us can hum many a Seekers song that she sang. They, of course, have been so enduring, well beyond the period in which they topped the charts. It is fitting that we've taken this opportunity, and I certainly join with other members, to pay tribute to her life achievements and to acknowledge and mourn the passing of Judith Durham.

             Judith Durham
            </a>
            AO. Born in Essendon to William Cock and Hazel Durham, she grew up between Victoria and Tasmania. She received formal training as a pianist from the University of Melbourne conservatorium. She began her singing career at 18 years of age out of sheer persistence. She frequented the Memphis Jazz Club and asked week after week to get on stage. The bandleader would tell her, 'Come back next week.' So she'd come back next week, and again she'd be dismissedâ€”'Come back next week.' She kept going to that jazz club week after week, until finally they let her on stage. Then, after having rejected this amazing singer for so long, everyone in the room was blown away by her voice.

            ', which still blasts out on my television screen on ABC Kids on a regular basis, causing half my household to break out into song, is still a favourite of many. One of the things that I want to share with the parliament today is that one of the unexpected outpourings of love for Judith Durham that we saw was the number of letters that were sent to the Australian government in good-hearted advocacy saying that 'I Am Australian' should be considered as our new national anthem. Now, that is not going to happen. We will not be going to a vote for a new national anthem, but I did have the joy, on behalf of the Prime Minister, of responding to hundreds and hundreds of letters from people who shared their love of this incredible Australian musician and the music that captured so much of this nation. Again, I thank everyone who wrote in with their good-hearted suggestions on that particular topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every one of those songs that I just mentioned sold over a million copies. Selling over a million copies of a song, particularly a song written in the sixties and released in Australia, is an incredible achievement for an Australian musical outfit. In 1968, another firstâ€”yet to be replicatedâ€”was that Durham and the entire group of the Seekers were named collectively as Australians of the Year. It was the eighth year of the Australian of the Year awards, and it is still to this day the only time that a group has received the Australian of the Year award. I'd just say, particularly with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Envoy" rel="nofollow">
             Special Envoy
            </a>
            for the Arts here, that the musicians of 2022 need to lift their game! But it is fitting that such a brilliant musical team got that award recognising their great contribution to Australia. Durham also had wonderful success as a solo artist, sharing that part of her musical journey with her husband, Ron Edgeworth.

            We saw some 2,000 people gather for her state memorial service, which included musical tributes from everyone from Dami Im through to the Wiggles. Her older sister, Beverley, recounted:

            And indeed it has been an inspiration to many. We saw the Seekers play a previously unreleased song, '

It is emblematic of us all. It is emblematic of our Indigenous brothers and sisters, of migrants to this nation. It speaks to the heart of Australia like no other song.

                on my early musical life, it was a real privilege to represent the Prime Minister at the Victorian state memorial in her honour. What a celebration of Judith Durham's life it was, with recognition from the Victorian governor of her impact on the music scene. We gained insights into the health challenges that Judith had faced, with such good humour, throughout her life, and also her determination, kindness and generosity. Athol, Keith and Bruce all demonstrated the affection that they had for Judith and their union. If you hadn't shed a tear before hearing them speak, this part of the night probably tipped a lot of people over.

                , shared a story about the singer's determination to perform at a jazz club as a young teenager. Apparently she'd turn at the same jazz club, week after week, and the band leader kept saying, 'Come back next week.' When he finally allowed her to perform, you have to wonder how hard he kicked himself for not having said yes a whole lot sooner. Perhaps there's a message there for young performers and bookers alike.

                and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra String Quartet. It was a beautiful night. But perhaps the most personal performance was 'Jelly Bean Blues' from Judith's big sister, Beverley Sheehan, accompanied by the Syncopators. The whole evening was a very Melbourne tribute but had the heart of the whole country there to thank Judith's family for the musical gift that she gave the nation. Vale, Judith Durham.
