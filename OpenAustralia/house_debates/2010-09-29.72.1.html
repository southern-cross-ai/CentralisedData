       <p>
        I would like to bring to the attention of the House the proposed poker machine reform and the effect that that would have on the registered clubs and hotels within the electorate of Parkes. While I am certainly no fan of poker machines, every town and community in my electorate relies on their local clubâ€”be it an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , a bowling club, a golf club or a services club. Quite often, it is the only venue in town. School presentations are held there, because it is the largest venue in town. They support junior sport and promote community activity. Any proposed changes to the revenue that they receive from poker machines would severely hamper the viability of these clubs. In many cases, it would make them unviable and they would close down.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing that is of concern is the proposed withdrawal limits on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        s. In many of my smaller villages, the only bank in town is the ATM at the local hotel. If that hotel has poker machines, people would not be able to withdraw their wages through the ATM as they do now. Many of the older folk in my electorate go into the club to withdraw money because it is safer to take money out of an ATM in a club than one in the street. As this House looks like it is going to be discussing poker machine reform, I hope that members take into account the effect that it will have on the clubs in the small communities in the Parkes electorate.
