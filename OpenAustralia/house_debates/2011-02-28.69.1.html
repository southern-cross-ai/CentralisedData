        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Efficiency" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        . What is the basis for the government taking strong action on climate change? What other sources could be drawn on to inform a policy position on climate change and what are the dangers to our national interest of forming policy on anything less than a well-informed basis?

          <p>
           Thank you, Mr Speaker. Climate scientists are telling governments all over the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The scientific consensus is overwhelming and the government respects the climate science. A government in that circumstance has a public policy responsibility to act upon that advice in everyone’s interests and we simply need to make a start in reducing carbon pollution in our economy. As the highest per capita emitter of carbon pollution amongst the developed countries, and being a nation that is especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change, we must tackle this issue.

              It is a public policy responsibility. The alternative would be to ignore the national interest, to ignore the science and to act solely in one’s political interest. Of course, that is exactly what we see from the other side of politics. And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition—

                 has notoriously described the science as ‘absolute crap’. Indeed, Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has argued that the science has been fabricated. Of course, Senator Minchin famously blamed it on the communists! But the Leader of the Opposition has come up with my favourite. He said the following back in November 2009:

                <p class="italic">
                 If you look at Roman times, grapes grew up against Hadrian’s Wall—medieval times they grew crops in Greenland. In the 1700s they had ice fairs on the Thames.

                <p>

                       My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement on 15 August last year, when he said:

                      <p class="italic">
                       Well certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax from the Liberals in their advertising. We reject that.

                        I really do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. There is a very basic reason why I take the position that I take and the government takes the position it takes: it is in the national interest. It is in the interests of a prosperous economy. What those opposite are doing is putting their political interests, through a scare campaign, ahead of the need to reduce carbon pollution and make our economy more prosperous for the future. The populism of those opposite is evident in the question from the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer used to believe, once upon a time, in markets. The shadow Treasurer, I know, goes around the place saying he is a great man of principle. In fact, he made this statement about what a great man of principle he was shortly after he was defeated in the Liberal Party leadership contest: ‘I believe in a market mechanism’—

                           Like the shadow Treasurer says he is, I am a believer in a market mechanism. What we are going to do is move through a fixed price to a market mechanism, and that was made very clear the other day. But, when the shadow Treasurer was defeated in the leadership contest, he made this point, because he said then that he was a believer in a market mechanism:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">

                           So he, like the Leader of the Opposition, is a hollow man. He says he believes in a market mechanism and opposes it in this House. He says he is a believer in the science of climate change—

The government have moved, in the national interest, to make sure that we can protect jobs, direct investment into renewable energy and protect the prosperity of our economy, and every step of the way we are opposed by those opposite, who would rather see the country fail than see us succeed in battling climate change and investing in renewable energy. It just shows that all of those opposite would say anything and do anything to win a political action, but they will not stand up for the political interests of this country. They are only looking after their own.

                               A market mechanism is the best mechanism because it produces the least cost, most efficient reduction in carbon pollution. So we on this side of the House think markets have an essential role in dealing with market failure when it comes to carbon pollution. Now, Mr Stern, the most pre-eminent economist in this area, has made the observation that this is the greatest market failure in history—the failure to price carbon pollution. The failure to price carbon pollution means that carbon pollution continues to be emitted, with devastating consequences for the planet, for the global economy and of course for this country. Those opposite do not believe in climate change anymore, so perhaps they are not concerned with that market failure, but we do know that a number of those opposite do believe there has been a market failure, that it does require a price mechanism. The member for Wentworth believes that. The shadow Treasurer used to believe that, once upon a time. But we on this side of the House understand how important market mechanisms are in dealing with substantial economic problems.

                               Of course, the Prime Minister spoke before about tariff reform—utilising changes in the price of goods, changes in the market—to bring about greater prosperity. But, of course, those opposite do not favour market mechanisms anymore. They want central government direction. They want regulation. This would not be odd if they were not the

                               , on whose basis it was form to say that they believed in the market. But they no longer believe in the market. This is a very big challenge for their economic credibility. It was not that long ago that the former Prime Minister Mr Howard believed in the market. This is what he had to say:
                              </p>
                              <p class="italic">
                               It is fundamental to any response both here and elsewhere that a price is set for carbon emissions. This is best done through the market mechanism of an emissions trading system.

                               It was a belief held by all of those towards the end of their period in government but now repudiated by those opposite. It is a belief which is held by many other countries in the world that are moving to put in place emissions trading systems. But, of course, now we have this incredible spectacle where those on the other side of the House, who professed to believe in markets, now believe in the heavy hand of regulation against free markets. Is that where the Liberal Party of Australia now believes they are—regulation over markets? We on this side of the House believe in markets. They believe in having a bureaucrat—

                                                      If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate on political honesty, well, bring it on. I am happy to debate that any day of the week. The Leader of the Opposition’s track record on these questions is absolutely clear. He has gone to election campaigns and not been truthful with the Australian people. He has tried to defend on TV his lack of truthfulness with moving excuses and with odd excuses.

The Leader of the Opposition has had every position on climate change it is possible for a human being to have. Climate change science—do you accept it or not accept it? The Leader of the Opposition has said and believed both. One day he accepts it; one day he does not. Do you price carbon or not price carbon? The Leader of the Opposition has said on different days different things about that. Some days he wants to price carbon; other days he wants to not price carbon. Do you want a carbon tax? The Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he wants a carbon tax.

On the question of pricing carbon and climate change, are you for it or against it? The Leader of the Opposition has had both positions: yes, he accepts the science; no, he does not. Should you price carbon? The Leader of the Opposition has had both positions: yes, you should; no, you should not. Should you support a carbon tax? Let me quote the words of the Leader of the Opposition—his words, not mine—
