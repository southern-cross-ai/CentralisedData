        On indulgence, I know that members in this parliament and Australians right around the nation are today watching their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        screens, listening to their radios and searching internet news sites for news of what is happening in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        in such tragic and difficult circumstances. As the House is keenly aware, last Friday afternoon an explosion at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_River" rel="nofollow">
         Pike River
        </a>
        coalmine at Greymouth in New Zealand left 29 miners trapped deep underground, including two Australians, William Joynson and Joshua Ufer. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken with their families and extended the nation’s support to them. I take this opportunity, on behalf of members of the parliament, to extend our support to the families who are waiting for news. Our high commissioner has travelled to Greymouth today to be there personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no disguising the gravity of this situation. As we know, search and rescue efforts have been hampered because of high levels of dangerous gas inside the mine, though there is now some drilling underway. We want nothing more than to see these 29 men brought to the surface safe and well. This is a hope that unites us and unites the world today. Understandably, the miners’ loved ones are becoming more and more anxious as each hour passes. Our hearts go out to them, because there could be nothing worse than living through those hours. For the present, we wait and we hope. We have seen two miracles, in Beaconsfield and in Chile. Today we look for a third.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing is certain: nothing will be wanting so far as expertise and resources are concerned. Mine rescue teams from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Queensland are already on the ground in New Zealand, with an additional three from New South Wales Mines Rescue travelling to New Zealand today. In addition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto" rel="nofollow">
         Rio Tinto
        </a>
        , Xstrata and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        have placed staff and resources at the ready for if they should be required.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken today to the Prime Minister of New Zealand and he personally thanked me for the efforts that Australia has gone to and wanted me to record his appreciation in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this moment of anguish, the thoughts of every Australian go out to the families of those who are trapped. Mining communities are close-knit communities and we know miners are engaged in dangerous work. Every Australian involved in the mining industry will today be thinking of their cousins across the Tasman with a special sense of solidarity. All of us join with them in hoping for a miracle. Thank you.

         On indulgence, I rise to support the Prime Minister and to state on behalf of the coalition that our thoughts and prayers are with the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         at this difficult time, and especially with the friends and families of the trapped miners. The experience of our miners at Beaconsfield, as well as the recent rescue in Chile, should be some antidote to the despair that the families of those trapped miners might otherwise feel. It is good that mining rescue teams from Australia are now going to the assistance of our Anzac brothers and sisters. This is excellent. The coalition stands ready to support any assistance that the government might care to offer in addition to this.
