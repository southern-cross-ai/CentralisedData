       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I'd like to tell you about the return of a dragon and the construction of a wonderful monument out in my home town of St George.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a memorial to the Chinese community, designed by a young school student, Daisy Brown. The project architect was Lewis MP Lee; the structural architect was Dr Peter Ho; the builder was Wing Hing Builders; and it was all supervised by

        . The unveiling ceremony for this project occurred on the weekend, out in the electorate of the agriculture minister, David Littleproud. We worked on this together; we were co-patrons, with the mayor,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the chairmanship of Jack Sun, the St George Chinese Community Memorial was a project which brought many people together. It was a wonderful opening ceremony, with the local councillors there and also Megan O'Hara Sullivan from the Toowoomba Shire Council. Also out there were Consul-General Shen Ang from the Consulate-General of the

        and Surendra Prasad. This event was overseen by Chek Ling, the heritage adviser.
       </p>
       <p>
        Simon Tang spoke, as did quite a few other people. Near the end of the project, we saw Melody Chen actually donate a dragon to the St George community. It was all about recognising the contribution of the Chinese diaspora to that part of St George, but it's a story that could be told in any town in Australia.
