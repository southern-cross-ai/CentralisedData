        My question is to the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House on the government's commitment to tenancy advice and advocacy services to support affordable housing across Australia, particularly in my home state of Queensland? Is the minister aware of any decisions that have reduced or removed these services?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Blair for his question and his ongoing advocacy for tenancy services in Queensland. I can say to him, and I think it is fitting given that yesterday was World Homeless Day, that there is a strong commitment by this government to make sure we do everything we can to prevent Australians finding themselves at risk of being homeless. Therefore, tenancy advice and advocacy services are vital. They are vital in every state and certainly in Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is true to say that some decisions have been made by the Queensland government that would have potentially impacted adversely upon 80,000 Queenslanders who require advice of the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service. Indeed, we know we need to ensure we prevent homelessness by having the services in place to prevent people being evicted from homes, to prevent mums and dads and kids finding themselves out on the street.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why the decision by the Queensland government to cut absolutely all funding to the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service was cruel and heartless. It was a cruel and heartless decision because it will impact so badly upon so many vulnerable Queenslanders and it was an economically absurd decision because it will cost more to look after those people who will be hurt as a result of that decision. Of course, there will be more front-line staff cut in Queensland as a result. That really does fit with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
          Campbell Newman
         </a>
         approach of 'all pain, no plan' when it comes to government services in that state.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is more galling is that the money that has been taken from these services is the interest accumulated from the bonds paid by tenants into the Residential Tenancies Authority. So it is not even taxpayers' money; it is tenants' money that has been taken by Campbell Newman. This was a terrible decision. As a result, this government has stepped up with $3.3 million of emergency funding to ensure the 23 offices across Queensland will remain open to look after up to 80,000 Queensland families each year. We are doing that to ensure that those services are there for those who need them. I have also made clear that from 1 July next year any future Commonwealth-state arrangement with Queensland in relation to housing and homelessness will have to ensure that those services are maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why did Premier Newman make such a decision? He has been emboldened by the shadow Treasurer and by the Leader of the Opposition, who said these cuts are good cuts. 'They are courageous cuts,' the shadow Treasurer said. They are disgraceful cuts, and we totally oppose them.
