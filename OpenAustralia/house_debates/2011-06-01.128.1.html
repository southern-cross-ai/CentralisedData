       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate the Margaret Ives Community Children's Centre, which is located in Norwood in the electorate of Adelaide and was recently named the National Children's Service of the Year in the 2011 Australian Family Child Care Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2005, Australian Family have been presenting their childcare awards to publicly recognise Australia's early childhood educators and carers. Every day, millions of Australian families are supported by the care and dedication of early childhood educators, carers and services. The Australian Family Child Care Awards are a celebration of these professionals, as they recognise the outstanding individuals and teams who make an important difference in the lives of children and families across Australia. As such, I am delighted that Margaret Ives has been publicly recognised for its outstanding contribution to the children and families in its care, as well as to our local community. I understand that it is the philosophy behind Margaret Ives that provided it with the winning edge in these awards. I know that this is demonstrated by its commitment to early childhood education and its delivery of superior care to our children on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government share that commitment to early childhood education and child care, because we know from years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future outcomes and we want to make sure that future is bright. That is why we have an ambitious agenda to improve the quality, affordability and accessibility of child care, and that is why we are investing more than $20 billion in funding over the next four years for early childhood education and child care.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the local member, but also as the relevant minister, I place on record my congratulations and my gratitude to the team at Margaret Ives for their fantastic contribution to the education and care of our children. This award is a fitting acknowledgement and I am sure that the whole Norwood community is celebrating your success. I also, of course, take this opportunity to thank and recognise all those who are working in the early education and care sector, who day in, day out are dedicated and passionate about giving Australian children the very best start in life. I know that they do not always get the recognition they deserve, but they should know that I, and I am sure this parliament, am very grateful for their dedication.
