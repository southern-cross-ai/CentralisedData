        On 16 November during our break from parliament I had the privilege and honour of attending the Wanneroo Business Association awards. The Wanneroo Business Association is such an active association within the city of Wanneroo and services many of the businesses in my electorate of Cowan. It was a fantastic event, honouring and recognising the work of small and medium enterprises within Cowan. I pay heed today to the board and the entire committee of the Wanneroo Business Association but I also take this opportunity to commend and congratulate the finalists and winners of the Wanneroo Business Association awards for 2018. The Innovator of the Year award went to Burdens Australia, which is a fantastic family-run business that does some fantastic work in developing the manufacturing industry within the electorate of Cowan. Tourism &amp; Hospitality Business of the Year went to The Marina, Mindarie. Start Up of the year went to

The Online &amp; Digital Excellence award went to Appliance Parts Solutions, who also took out the Trades Excellence Award. Best Home Based Business went to Office Overload Solutions Pty Ltd. Congratulations to the Employee of the Year, Bianca Crompton, from Cherished Cherubs Babysitting—what a fantastic name!—another great family-run home-based business. The Best Business: 15 &amp; Over Employees award went to Resolute Security Services, who provide not only security services but also a lot of employment opportunities for people within the Cowan electorate. The Best Business: Over 5 &amp; Under 15 Employees award went to Bizwize Business Solutions. The Best Business 1-5 Employees award went to Captain Electro Pty Ltd, another small family business. Congratulations to the 2018 Business of the Year (Judges' Choice), which was announced on the night and went to Resolute Security Services. The Mayor's Visionary Award, which was also announced on the night, went to Bev Errington from Kingsway Community Financial Services. I congratulate all the finalists and winners, and all businesses in Cowan, who do fantastic work employing people and contributing to the community not just economically but also in the work that they do.
