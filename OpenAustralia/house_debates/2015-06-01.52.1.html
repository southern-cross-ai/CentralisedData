        I rise to inform the House of the great work of Wide Bay Whirly Birds, whose fundraiser I attended on Saturday, 23 May. It was a back to the 50s night, Deputy Speaker, which I am sure you would be very interested in. There were plenty of Sandra Dees and Danny Zukos everywhere—Brylcreem and pink ladies and black jackets. I have to say that I was not so great at the dancing; I did give it a go, but I think I will go back to my normal position of dancing on the inside at this type of event. They did do very well. There were 83 guests at the historic Paragon Theatre in Childers and they raised $2800, which goes towards the local rescue helicopter service—a very important service for regional Australia. I congratulate the organisers—Madonna Ryan and Tracey Palmer. They did a fabulous job.

        Wide Bay Whirly Birds has been around for four years since the first lot of floods struck the region. They do a wonderful job raising lots of money for an essential service. Their next event is at the Bundaberg

        on 24 October, and I encourage lots of local people to attend. While I have the opportunity, Deputy Speaker, I would also like to mention
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">
         John Kennedy

        , one of the local crewmen in the helicopter service. I know John well, and he is well-known in surf lifesaving circles. Whilst I hope I never see John and his team in a professional capacity, it is a great relief to me and all the people of the electorate and around Queensland that these services are available to help support emergency services and to provide an essential service to regional Australia, but they cannot do it without funds.
