       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I acknowledge your support and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his enthusiastic encouragement of my seeking of this indulgence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, the first member for Berowra, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Hughes
        </a>
        , AO,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC" rel="nofollow">
         KC
        </a>
        , celebrated his 100th birthday. Tom Hughes is one of the handful of people who, having served in this House, have reached such a milestone. Tom's service is synonymous with principled and dignified leadership. During World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , Tom served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        and was part of the invasion of Normandy. For his part in the skies, Tom received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Legion" rel="nofollow">
         French Legion
        </a>
        of Honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1963 as the member for Parkes. His campaign manager was his friend the young
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        , and they remain friends to this day. When Parkes was abolished, Tom became the first member for Berowra. He also served as Attorney-General in the government of his friend Sir
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gorton" rel="nofollow">
         John Gorton
        </a>
        . As Attorney, he sought to expand the use of Commonwealth power in the corporations and seabed areas, and he had a clear understanding of the need to keep Australians safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes safety begins at home. On one occasion protesters turned up at Tom's home. They included the future
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        minister Ian Macdonald. Tom famously drove them off his lawn with a cricket bat. When John Gorton lost the prime ministership, Tom also left the parliament, but he remained loyal to Gorton to the end. Not since Pericles has there been a more famous or cutting funeral oration than the one Tom delivered at John Gorton's funeral.
       </p>
       <p>
        After politics, Tom returned to the bar. Tom was admitted to the bar in his 20s and he retired from the bar at age 90. At his peak, it seemed that every big case in Australia needed Tom Hughes. Sportspeople, media personalities and even judges sought his counsel.
       </p>
       <p>
        At one point, Tom found himself defending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        in a New South Wales court while simultaneously seeking an order against Mr Whitlam in an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        court. They were totally unrelated cases, but such was his reputation that everyone was happy with the arrangement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom Hughes is known for his courtroom manner. It's sometimes said that he was 'frosty Tom'. I won't deny him this mystique, myth and reputation, but that has not been my experience of him. Tom Hughes is warm, generous, wise and thoughtful. He's been a dear counsellor, mentor and friend to me, as he has been to so many people. I was honoured that he attended this chamber for my maiden speech, and I value his friendship greatly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom is a man with a devoted family who bring him immense joy, including his wife, Chrissie; his children, Tom, Lucy and Michael; his grandchildren; and his great-grandchildren. So happy birthday, Tom Hughes, and congratulations on this wonderful milestone.

         on indulgence—I join with the member for Berowra, and on behalf of the government I wish

         </a>
         a very happy 100th birthday. His has been a very full life and a life well lived—a life in which he has sought to deliver on his principles. He was a servant in this House but also a very significant figure in legal circles in Sydney,
