        honours. I cannot believe he has been chairman of the Pakenham Racing Club for the last 12 years. I think back on the tradition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ronald" rel="nofollow">

        , then

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore" rel="nofollow">

        , and the great transition from a small country club to a magnificent new facility carried through with the great vision of Don Duffy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don was not just recognised for his contribution to racing and to the Pakenham Racing Club. There were also his contributions to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Margaret's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Margaret's College
        </a>
        , to the horticultural society and to the Pakenham cemetery, and his broader contributions to the community in many ways that we will never know about.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love the way that in all humility Don said to the community, 'There are so many people in the community whose efforts go unsung who are just as deserving as I am.' But I put to the House today what Jack 'The Drake' Drake, son of 'Bunny' Drake, would have said about this commendation. He would have looked at the new Pakenham racecourse and said to Don Duffy, 'Sensational, Don! Sensational!' That is what
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Drake" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Drake
        </a>
        would have said. He has passed on, and his dad has passed on. They were great contributors to our local community, as have been Don Duffy and his beautiful and smart wife, Kate. He could not have achieved any of those things without the contribution of Kate involved in the life of Don Duffy OAM.
