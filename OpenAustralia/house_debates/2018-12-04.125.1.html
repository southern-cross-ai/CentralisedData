        In my electorate tomorrow, in Bridgewater, more than 100 people will gather for the annual Dining with Friends Christmas dinner. Unfortunately, this year I can't be there in person but I will be there in Christmas spirit. Dining with Friends is run by Vinnies and it occurs every month in Bridgewater. There are similar events elsewhere in my electorate, notably Oatlands, and across other electorates in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every month, members of the Bridgewater and Brighton communities can turn up for a good healthy feed, prepared by an amazing crew of volunteers, coordinated by Natalie Klug from Vinnies. There's no set price. People pay what they can afford. Sometimes it's $5; sometimes it's $10; if the power bill has come in or the rent is to be paid, they can enjoy a three-course meal for as little as $2, surrounded by other members of their community. Not only does Dining with Friends feed the body, it feeds the soul.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to support Dining with Friends, and I volunteer when I can, putting on an apron, serving food, doing dishes and collecting dirty plates. It's a great way to stay connected with my community. But my efforts pale in comparison to that of volunteers like Annie, Robin, Jane and Rick, as well as some local nuns—many originally from the Philippines—and local Scouts and Cubs, who serve the food with great enthusiasm, I must say, pushing those trolleys around like race cars!
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to quickly like to mention Dave William, who died suddenly a little over a year ago. Dave was a champion of Dining with Friends, and his humour and dedication are much missed. It has not been the same without Dave, but his friends and his loved ones still turn up to do their bit for this fantastic Bridgewater community. Tomorrow's event is going to be pretty special—fresh seafood, delicious hams, roasted vegetables, entree and dessert, all dished up with love and care. Everything being served tomorrow has been bought with donations, and I'd like to say a special thank you to those who have contributed:

        Where would Australia be without Vinnies and the incredible work it does for some of the most vulnerable people in our community? I can't be at the Christmas dinner in Bridgewater, but I do look forward to attending the Vinnies charity fundraising barbecue here at parliament tomorrow at noon. I encourage all members of this place to get along and support this incredible organisation.
