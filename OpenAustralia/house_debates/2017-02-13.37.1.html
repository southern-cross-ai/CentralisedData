       <p>
        Australian citizenship is precious, and the community must have confidence in how cases are considered and how it is granted. Integrity in the administration of the citizenship function is critical. The process must be effective, efficient and free from politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, there are worrying signs that the government is not managing the system with integrity. Hundreds of people in my electorate are stuck in limbo, their applications stalled and their lives on hold. The law is clear: if someone meets the requirements to have citizenship conferred upon them then they shall be processed. It does not matter where they are from, or how they came to live with us.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office has been inundated by distraught, frustrated, and often desperate people as nothing is happening—for years—with their applications. Many are from the Hazara Afghani community, although there are others, and there is growing evidence that the government is targeting certain classes of people. Yet they refuse to give any sensible explanations. Last December a Federal Court judgement confirmed the problems, declaring that there was unreasonable delay in making a decision to approve or to refuse applications, there are serious administration issues in the department, and there is mysterious, extensive and unexplained leapfrogging in the queue. The community anger and despair is real.

        I am speaking at a community meeting in Dandenong on 25 February. I urge anyone who is interested to come along and share their story.
