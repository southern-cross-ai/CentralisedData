        One of the great indicators of our fabulous, multicultural nation is the number of significant days for cultural and religious observances that have become part of the broader Australian calendar. One that has become very widespread, which is fantastic to see, is that of Deepavali, which falls on this Wednesday, 11 November. There have been many events conducted throughout Australia, and I would just like to mention a few of them that have been held around my area. Yesterday the Hindu Council of Australia had their Deepavali fair at Parramatta Park, and it was one of the best occasions ever for Deepavali. They have been holding these fairs for many years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        of Indian Australians also held a Deepavali event in my electorate at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ponds" rel="nofollow">
         The Ponds
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Last weekend, also in my electorate, a number of the subcontinent based businesses in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Seven Hills
        </a>
        held their first local Deepavali event around Boomerang Place. It was great to see the amount of support from those small businesses who took the initiative, along with support from other groups like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blacktown City Council
        </a>
        . It was a really fun-filled family day. A few weeks ago we also had the Blacktown Deepavali Mela at Blacktown Showground. All of these great events were made possible by organisations who put in a lot of time and effort, including by many volunteers. It is also significant to note the amazing amount of sponsorship that goes into running these events, which are devised as family days. It is great to see the wide cross-section of society, in particular the large number of families, that have been attending these events.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that note I would like to take the opportunity to invite all members and senators to join in the Hindu Council of Australia's Deepavali celebrations in the parliament, which will be happening on the next sitting Monday, 23 November, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        . This will be the 10th year that Deepavali will be celebrated in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . It is also a regular feature of other parliaments around Australia, which is fantastic to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly I would like to note that this year Deepavali coincides with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . I think it is opportune to remember the large numbers of service men and women from India and elsewhere on the subcontinent, from many different religions, who served alongside Australian forces in the great wars and still do so today. I would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone celebrating Deepavali a very joyous occasion full of light and full of acts of sevaâ€”selfless service to others. How appropriate it is that we, as servants of our communities, practice and promote goodwill through such acts of seva. I wish everyone a very joyous and happy Deepavali.
