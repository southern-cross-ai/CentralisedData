        My question again is to the Treasurer. Why can’t the Treasurer answer a direct question with a direct answer about what he actually said about the Prime Minister’s inability to win the next election? Treasurer, will you confirm that you were asked on Sky News yesterday a question about what you said in 2005, and that question—

         Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on standing order 98. They cannot go on breaching it indefinitely like this.

          I am listening carefully to the Leader of the Opposition. So far, it seems a repeat of a previous question, but he has not completed his question. In calling him, I remind him that he should not use the expression ‘you’.

           Does the Treasurer recall being asked on Sky News yesterday whether he had said, in 2005, ‘

           can’t win the election but I can’? Does the Treasurer recall his answer, which was, ‘No’? Does the Treasurer stand by that answer in parliament today?

            I think that is an identical question, but if the Treasurer chooses to answer it I will call the Treasurer.

            <p>
             Mr Speaker, I have already answered it three times. The answer the fourth time is precisely the same. But I will take this opportunity to say, having answered the question the fourth time, that the Leader of the Opposition has another six questions to get through in question time. He will be desperately trying to ask this or a variation of this question for the next six as well because, if he ever got off this—and I see people nodding in the gallery as well—he might have to talk about jobs or interest rates. He might have to talk about his tax policy. Maybe he might even have to talk about Rosanna Harris. If we can get onto some substantive issues which the people of Australia care about then they will know that there is one side of politics that is interested in substance. It is the coalition. There is another side of politics which is interested in stunts, and that is none other than that of the Leader of the Opposition.
