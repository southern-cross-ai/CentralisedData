        On 20 May 2013, Prime Minister Julia Gillard wrote to then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Chief Minister Katy Gallagher to establish a Centre for Quality Teaching and Learning at the University of Canberra. The role of the centre was to help Australia place in the top five countries globally in reading, maths and science by 2025; to increase teacher effectiveness; and to assist in implementing continuous teacher performance feedback. The contract was signed on 24 July 2013, well before the caretaker period began. It provided for start-up funding of $2 million, plus $4 million per year, making a total payment of $26 million across six years.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to infrastructure projects, the Abbott government says that it is vital to honour contracts. Indeed, the Prime Minister has criticised the Canberra Liberal opposition for saying they will tear up contracts for ACT light rail. Unfortunately, the Abbott government's love for adhering to contracts does not extend to the contract signed between the Commonwealth of Australia and the University of Canberra on 24 July 2013. After signing the contract, the University of Canberra set about establishing the centre, putting in place management personnel and staff and embarking on the important work of raising teacher quality. In meetings with the University of Canberra after the change of government, the Abbott government gave no sign that it was looking to shut down the centre. It made an initial payment of $1 million. It then refused to nominate a board member or agree to a proposed board chair.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 13 May 2014, nearly a year into the agreement, the government wrote to the University of Canberra, cancelling the contract. It has since refused to pay the university's invoices, totalling $4.4 million to date. The government says it cares about teacher quality and it cares about honouring contracts. Unfortunately, this episode demonstrates that it cares about neither. Moreover, I cannot help wondering whether the University of Canberra is being specifically targeted by Minister Pyne, given that its vice-chancellor has pointed out some of the risks in the government's plans for fee deregulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on Minister Pyne to stop playing student politics with a great Australian university. If this government really believes in honouring contracts, it should do so in all cases, not merely when it suits its political cause. If the government intends to terminate its contract with the University of Canberra, the least it could do would be to pay them for the invoices that they delivered before cancellation.
