        My question is to the Prime Minister. How does it improve business confidence around Australia to have a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Labor government that is dumping infrastructure projects, sacking employees, increasing taxes and running the biggest budget deficit in 15 years? Does the Prime Minister agree with his own finance minister that the future of the New South Wales economy will ‘depend on what we do’? Does he agree that the Rudd government now owns the New South Wales economy?

         This government has embarked upon a course of action which does not simply perpetuate the blame game of the past. This government believes that when it comes to the nation’s future challenges you work with state and territory governments, Labor and Liberal. We intend to work as closely with the state government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         as we will do with the state government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . The state government of Western Australia has an interest when it comes to the future—it is in how we partner with them in infrastructure investments—and that is the interest of all responsible state governments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The difference is this: state governments in the past, when they approached the previous Liberal government for assistance on infrastructure, were simply given the cold shoulder. The previous Liberal government was not interested. The previous Liberal government—and the member for Higgins will recall this very well—said that when it came to infrastructure that was exclusively a state responsibility.

            ’s question was about the extent to which Commonwealth governments work or do not work with state governments. I have responded to that question by saying we have an approach on infrastructure. We have an approach when it comes to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
             COAG
            </a>
            . We have an approach when it comes to the future of health and education expenditure and we will seek to work cooperatively with the states for the future. What is at stake here is the nation’s economy and the national interest in which the states and territories also have a significant part.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other part of responsibility, I would say to the member for North Sydney and to the member for Wentworth, is this: it lies also, at times of global financial crisis, in supporting our major economic and financial regulatory institutions.

               ’s question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, and economic responsibility in turn depends on whether you are going to support the independence of the economic institutions of this country, including the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                Reserve Bank
               </a>
               and the

                Secretary of the Treasury
               </a>
               , and including the independence and integrity of the regulators. Once again we have the member for Canning out there today hooking into the Secretary of the Treasury. It says here:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               When asked about the Secretary of the Treasury the member for Canning says that he is an ‘activist’. It is unusual for a head of the Treasury to behave in this way. He is probably the first one to show those tendencies.
              </p>
              <p>
               We then go on to the member for O’Connor who goes on to say:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               What is going on down at the Treasury?

               in a conversation going back to the opposition days said to me, ‘If in doubt, take Treasury’s advice.’ That was because in the past they put policy before politics. They really need to take a close look at themselves. They used to be one department that was held in high regard even in opposition.
              </p>
              <p>
               So today, on this day when the debate on the future of the economy is again central to our concerns in this parliament, we have the attack dogs of the Liberal Party out there attacking once again—

                      Order! The member for Warringah will resume his seat. The question went to the matter of economic responsibility. The Prime Minister will respond to the question. As I said earlier to the member for O’Connor: no further encouragement.

                       ’s question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, which again hangs on the independence of our regulators and the integrity of those regulators. Our responsibility as the government is to defend the regulators. Those opposite seem to believe it is their mandate to attack the regulators or, as they have done today again, authorise an attack on the regulators. That is what has occurred not just through the member for Canning and not just through the member for O’Connor but also from the member for Goldstein.

                                     was about taking responsibility for the economy. I would say this to the member for North Sydney: as Prime Minister of Australia, I take responsibility for the good news and the bad news, and when the bad news comes I will take responsibility for that as well, because what the nation wants is not some political game plan whereby you flick responsibility to someone else all the time—where you flick responsibility to the states and territories. What the nation wants is national leadership in the national interest. What the nation wants is tough decisions in tough economic times. This government is prepared to take them.

                                           Later on today I will be introducing the government’s legislation to deliver an Economic Security Strategy of substantial one-off payments to pensioners, families, carers and, of course, first home buyers. If the member for Pearce does not find that worth listening to, then I suspect she is in a small minority. These initiatives will strengthen jobs and economic growth and they will help the government to push back against the downward pressures on our economy emerging from the international financial crisis.

                                           has cut interest rates by 200 basis points—a full two percentage points reduction in interest rates since September. That means, on average, about $400 per month in relief on interest rates for people with mortgages around $300,000. After years of coping with ever-increasing interest rates under the former government—the government that told Australians they would keep interest rates at record lows—this is welcome relief for homebuyers in Australia.

                                           of the Business Council of Australia, Greg Gailey, wrote to the Prime Minister a few days ago on both of these matters—the Economic Security Strategy and the government’s approach to protecting our banking system—saying: ‘The

                                           supported the government’s economic security initiative as timely, targeted and temporary. We support the amendments to the deposit and wholesale lending guarantees for the same reasons.’

                                           Unfortunately, the support for the government’s strategies has not been completely universal. It has been very broad, but it has not been entirely universal. The opposition, on both occasions when these initiatives were announced, stated that it would offer them bipartisan support. But in practice the opposition has done nothing other than attack and undermine and snipe against the government’s initiatives. We saw a lot of statesmanlike posturing by the Leader of the Opposition at the time about how he would give all this bipartisan support and so forth but, unfortunately, we cannot trust what the Leader of the Opposition says—we have to watch what he does. He is a very clever politician but, unfortunately, the investment banker gene runs very strong: you spin the story, you do the deal, you take your cut and then you move on—that is the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, in a few short months in the job, he has been against cutting the fuel excise, in favour of cutting the fuel excise and then against cutting the fuel excise. He was against increasing pensions; now he is in favour of increasing pensions. He described the global financial crisis as the greatest economic crisis in our lifetimes and then he said that it was being overhyped. That is why we do not take the pious platitudes about bipartisanship all that seriously.

When the word ‘bipartisanship’ was put to her, her response on the spot was ‘Overrated.’ I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have some problem with copying something the government is doing and not giving credit for it. Given her recent experiences, I can understand why she would have some problem with that, but now today we have seen the consequences from the signal that was given on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition by the deputy leader last night. We have seen it in a coordinated, concerted attack on the

That last one, of course, was from the member for O’Connor.

                                           There is one honourable, decent person on the opposition benches, and that is the member for Kooyong, who is widely respected in the community on both sides of parliament. You can see why: he understands what is going on here—he realises how appalling this is. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to immediately repudiate these attacks by his three members on the Secretary of the Treasury and to stick to his statements of 22 October when he indicated the Secretary of the Treasury was held in his highest regard.
