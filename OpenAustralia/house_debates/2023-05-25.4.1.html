       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This one is more technical. The Creative Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023 makes consequential amendments and provides transitional arrangements to Commonwealth laws to support the proposed establishment of Creative Australia. This is in line with this government's National Cultural Policy—Revive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key element of the bill is to provide for the repeal of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        Act 2013, and to facilitate the continued operations of the entity during its transition from the Australia Council to Creative Australia in accordance with the proposed new enabling legislation, the Creative Australia Bill 2023; I did in fact move the bill we're now repealing. This will ensure business continuity and prevent disruption of funding or services to artists, arts workers and organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        To avoid any doubt, the bill clarifies that staff currently employed at the Australia Council will continue as employees of Creative Australia on their existing employment terms and conditions. Similarly, consultants currently engaged by the Australia Council will continue to be engaged by Creative Australia on the same terms and conditions. Mr Adrian Collette will continue in the role of chief executive officer under Creative Australia, further ensuring the smooth transition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new Australia Council board established under the Creative Australia Bill 2023 will be critical in providing leadership and direction as Creative Australia delivers on the first stages of measures under Revive. Therefore, the board will be refreshed with increased membership to reflect the expanded functions of Creative Australia and to make sure that the appropriate skills and expertise are represented across the broad remit of the entity. This bill provides the mechanism for that refresh, with all existing board members, other than the chief executive officer, ceasing to hold office after the repeal of the Australia Council Act 2013. Committees established under the Australia Council Act 2013 will also cease at the transition time.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure there is no delay in the appointment of the new board, this bill dispenses with the requirement for the minister to consult the chair in making initial appointments to the board at the transition time. Similarly, the minister will not be required to consult the chair of the Music Australia Council or the chair of the Creative Workplaces Council on its initial appointments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Safeguards have been included to avoid any doubt and prevent any disruption in Creative Australia receiving its allocation of government funds under the relevant appropriation acts. This bill also specifies transitional reporting requirements to ensure Creative Australia continues to remain accountable for its expenditure and operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with the Creative Australia Bill 2023, this bill will deliver much needed support to Australia's creative sector. It demonstrates this government's commitment to the arts and delivers on the National Cultural Policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill ensures a seamless transition in operational and governance arrangements to Creative Australia—a restored and modernised Australia Council and the centrepiece of Revive.
       </p>
       <p>
        I simply, as a matter of process, advise the House that, while those requirements for consultation are not required for the initial board, as is normally the case, that consultation with the existing chairs is happening in any event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
