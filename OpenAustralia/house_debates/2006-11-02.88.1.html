       <p>
        Yesterday the member for Grayndler asked me about the annual report of the Department of Parliamentary Services, which reports three of its targets—energy consumption, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions—were not met in 2005-06. These targets were set internally by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
         DPS
        </a>
        , with the clear aim of improving its environmental performance. When the targets were set it was recognised that it would be a challenge to meet them in the first year because they require a range of innovative approaches to the department’s operations. The annual report provides clear explanations for the increases in water and energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for 2005-06 and I will refer to them in turn.
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to increased energy use, in 2005-06 parliament met on 17 more days than in the previous year, which was an election year. As well, in 2005-06 there was an increase in the responsibility of DPS to cover street lighting on Parliament Drive and, as members may recall, it was the coldest autumn in Canberra since 1967. Even so, during 2005-06, the total energy used in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        was the second lowest since the building opened in 1988.
       </p>
       <p>
        The increased greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to the increased energy use. The increased water consumption can be attributed to major landscape redevelopment after completion of the security enhancement project, the need to replace turf and plants lost during the drought and an unusually dry summer. Evaporation loss in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        for the period from 1 December 2005 was 1,082 millimetres compared to the long-term average of 793 millimetres. Throughout the drought, at the President’s and my direction, Parliament House has met the water savings targets of the ACT government. Currently, DPS planners are working on a new water strategy, and a new energy strategy will also be developed this year. DPS has recently signed a new electricity contract under which the department’s purchase of ‘green’ energy will rise from 10 per cent to 25 per cent of the total energy purchased.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this building opened in 1988, electricity consumption has been reduced by 36 per cent, gas consumption has been reduced by 71 per cent, carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 45 per cent, and total energy consumption has been reduced by 55 per cent. Incidentally, around 63 per cent of the paper used in Parliament House is now recycled. Parliament House has, in fact, won major awards—including from the Greenhouse Office and the Institution of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Engineers Australia
        </a>
        , which recognise energy and greenhouse emission reductions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, as building occupants, I encourage all members to play their part to save energy and water whilst working in this House. It is, of course, a responsibility for all of us.
