        I rise to promote the great community work done by Lifeline and to act as ambassador for this noble cause. For the past 49 years, Lifeline has been at the forefront of suicide prevention, now boasting 43 Lifeline centres and operating in 19 nations to spread the message that most suicides are preventable. Lifeline's Out of the Shadows campaign provides a very simple yet powerful message to all Australians with mental illness and to all those who may know someone experiencing it. The message is: come out of the shadows and seek help, because you are not alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia it is estimated that 65,000 people attempt suicide every year. Tragically, every day, six people take their own lives. Lifeline receives 1,250 calls every day from people who need crisis support, to express their anguish or just to have someone to talk to. A simple conversation can make a difference to someone who is in the darkness, as it can be a source of light or hope.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suicide prevention can be addressed at different levels in Australia, starting with a change in the community's attitude towards mental illness. For those who are in the dark, social stigmas create a barrier to seeking help. Amongst Australians aged 15 to 44, suicide continues to be the leading cause of death, accounting for one in every four deaths. Males commit suicide at the rate of 16 per 100,000 compared with 4.5 per 100,000 for females. As it is thought unmanly to express emotions, men are far less likely to seek help. As community leaders, we must share the message that we are only human and that it is in our nature to react to grief, to feel pain or to cry about loss. It is not a sign of weakness. As men, we tend to forget that message.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Suicide_Prevention_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Suicide Prevention Day
        </a>
        is on 10 September. The theme this year is 'suicide prevention across the globe: strengthening protective factors and instilling hope.' I urge all my parliamentary colleagues to participate in or host activities as part of the event and to look out for a Lifeline Out of the Shadows walk in their community. For more information visit www.outoftheshadows.org.au.

       <p>
        Most suicides are preventable and we all have a role to play. The best method of increasing awareness is through looking out for your mates and promoting that there is a 24/7 confidential and non-judgemental phone service out there if they need help. We need to encourage people to step out of the shadows and into the light—because they are not alone—and to support organisations like Lifeline which perform such an important role in our community.
