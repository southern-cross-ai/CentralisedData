        I received this email in my office today:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Jenny,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without wasting your precious time too much, I wanted to tell you some of my news. It's nothing to do with my visa, but I wanted to share it with you, as it is all part of this hard struggle we have been through to try and settle here.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tomorrow night is the graduation ceremony for my college, Chisholm. I hadn't planned on going, as it is a costly affair, but was most surprised to be contacted last week by someone from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        's office, and invited to attend as one of their Guest Speakers! They want me to stand up and speak about all my 'achievements', to an audience of about 1000 people.(I think it will be a great achievement if I can simply get through the evening!!!)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Back home, there were no

        s or choices of university's to attend. There was just one, the

        . I never had the opportunity to go there as my mother just didn't have the funds. In more recent years, it has now almost closed down.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Who would ever have dreamed that 25 years later, I am here in one of the greatest countries in the world, and although had not planned on attending my own graduation, I am now going as a guest. Does life get any better than that! What an honour. It will be held at

        as the M.C for the night. She is an ex Olympian swimmer, with two gold medals to her name. What an occasion for me. All I wish is that my dear Mum could be here to see all this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I hope that I can stand up there and give credit and gratitude to all those who have made our struggle here more bearable and so worthwhile.
       </p>

        No, Sarah has not got a permanent visa to this country, but it is not bad for a Zimbabwe squash champion who lost everything in Zimbabwe and is now here in this country. We will do our best to get you a visa, Sarah.
