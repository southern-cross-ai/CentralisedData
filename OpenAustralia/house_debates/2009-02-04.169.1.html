        I want to place on record my absolute delight about the latest round of the Australian governmentâ€™s National Secondary School Computer Fund, which will deliver 450 new computers to seven local schools in Chifley. It is going to be really great for all those students in years nine to 12, great for the teachers and great for the parents. Of course, it is true that in Chifley many households already have a computer, but by and large we are an information-poor electorate. Therefore, having adequately resourced computers in our schools is really critical to the success of the students.
       </p>

        This was an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , during the 2007 federal election. We have committed $1.9 billion in funding new information and communications technology equipment in Australian secondary schools. I am delighted for the successful schools.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Agnes_Catholic_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Agnes Catholic High School
        </a>
        received 113 computers; Loyola Senior High School, 144;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View_Adventist_College" rel="nofollow">
         Mountain View Adventist College
        </a>
        , 40;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndale_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
         Tyndale Christian School
        </a>
        , 114; Bethel Christian School, 22; and St Bishoy Coptic Orthodox College, nine. Blacktown Youth College received eight, and they also received 30 in the first round. I know that the Catholic schools have taken the option of buying an off-the-shelf computer and these are being rolled out very quickly. The state schools have opted to develop a ruggedised computer, and that is taking some time to roll out. No public school or high school in my electorate applied in round 2. I am glad that has changed, and I would encourage those high schools that were not part of round 1 to apply for round 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also say with great sadness that the extra money flowing to high schools and primary schools in my electorate, announced yesterday as part of the package, is now being opposed by the opposition. It is a worry as to whether or not we can get this money for every primary school in my electorate through what is a hostile Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the government for taking this initiative. I can say that in the 12 years of the Howard government no comparable proposal was ever put forward. I do know that the students are really benefiting from these computers.
