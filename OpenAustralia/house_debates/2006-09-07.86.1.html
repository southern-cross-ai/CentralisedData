       <p>
        Bonner is a diverse community and, since being elected, I have made it my priority to gain an understanding of the issues that are of greatest importance to all sections of the community. I feel particularly strongly about the voice of youth, and I think it is extremely important that our young leaders be given the opportunity to speak and to be heard. In March this year, I proposed the development of a Bonner Youth Leaders Advisory Committee that would, in essence, facilitate a place and time for student leader representatives from each high school in the electorate to come together and speak about issues that are most important to them. This proposal was well received by principals throughout the electorate and, as a result, the Bonner Youth Leaders Advisory Committee is now established and recently met for the second time to discuss youth issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise this morning to acknowledge these youth representatives and to share some of the thoughts that have emerged from our discussions. Of primary concern to both state and private school students is the years 11 and 12 English syllabus, which is, for many, proving a major frustration. All the students were quick to agree that the marking criteria and grading are simply too complicated, with some teachers having to take an entire lesson just to decipher and explain what is actually required. Furthermore, for some of the students it is a major stress to think that they can no longer achieve an A or a B; instead they are ranked as an A-plus 4 or an A-plus 2, for example. These complicated criteria and rankings which are weaved into each subject are not only distracting but also increasingly a source of stress and confusion for many of the students.
       </p>
       <p>
        An interesting point was raised in relation to other sources of stress in senior school years, that being that an increasing number of students place significant pressure on themselves in response to the competitive learning environment. While in some cases this may help students to achieve a higher standard, in other cases it can be extremely destructive. The recent committee meeting also resulted in a creative and positive discussion regarding the school leavers guides that the federal government provides each year to students completing year 12. The guides are a welcome source of information but, during the excitement of finishing their high school year, students can often dismiss or misplace the guides.
       </p>
       <p>
        To combat this, the Bonner youth leaders whom I have worked with have formed a plan that will see the inclusion of a special voucher section within the guide which will offer students a wide variety of two-for-one deals and the like from local businesses and well-loved takeaways. This is a project that will not only benefit students but also assist local business and ensure that the school leavers guide is something not to be missed. I thank each member of the Bonner Youth Leaders Advisory Committee for their innovative ideas. I particularly want to acknowledge Lauren Cuskelly and
