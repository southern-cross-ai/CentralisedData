       <p>
        I rise today to update the Chamber on an announcement I made in my electorate of Swan during the last break. I'm very proud to share with the Chamber that the Morrison Liberal government will invest $4 million to kickstart the redevelopment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Football Club
        </a>
        grandstand at Lathlain oval, as part of the next phase of the Lathlain Precinct Development Project. The government is providing this initial financial support for the project, which will demolish the existing grandstand and build a modern standalone facility for Perth Football Club and the community at Lathlain oval.
       </p>
       <p>
        As everyone in this place is aware, the Liberal-National government has been a strong supporter of the Lathlain development since being elected in 2013, delivering the vital investment that has enabled the development to get underway, including $10 million in 2015 for the community aspects of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        ' new home at Lathlain oval and $3 million investment in 2016 to support the co-location of the Wirrpanda Foundation to assist Indigenous youth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new Perth Football Club grandstand will ensure that ongoing programs can be delivered and that the club can have an even greater level of community engagement. Most importantly, it will also improve facilities for female players, meaning more women and girls in our community can participate in the great game of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Aussie Rules
        </a>
        . With the rise in popularity of the AFLW, this is a fantastic part of the project. I'd particularly like to thank the West Coast Eagles and the Perth Football Club for their advocacy and support for this new development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lathlain development epitomises the coalition's policy of fostering economic activity, including jobs and growth, through infrastructure investment. This funding commitment, along with the financial support already indicated by the Town of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Park
        </a>
        and the West Coast Eagles, will kickstart this development, as the grandstand really is the next step for the Lathlain precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm confident that the project will better enable clubs from the national competition and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAFL" rel="nofollow">
         WAFL
        </a>
        to be even more closely aligned, to work together in connecting with our local community here in Swan and enhancing both of the clubs. Our project is about ensuring our local kids will have the facilities they need to get out there and enjoy, and to get involved in the best things that sport has to offer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The redevelopment really is the next stage in delivering the Liberals' vision for a world-class sporting precinct in the electorate of Swan at Lathlain park and Optus Stadium, providing every opportunity for our kids to excel. I look forward to viewing the games from the grandstand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, in the short time I have left, I'd like to wish you and your family all the best for Christmas, and, to the opposition and to my colleagues on this side of the chamber, Christmas wishes and

        </a>
        wishes as well. In particular, I'd also like to thank my staff for all the work they do for me in my electorate. I particularly thank my wife, who is the long-suffering support person for me while I'm away in Canberra. Congratulations to everyone for the Christmas and New Year period.
