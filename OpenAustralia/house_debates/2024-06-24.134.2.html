        The Dohles Rocks Road on and off ramps in Griffin are one of the most eagerly awaited and anticipated infrastructure projects in the Petrie electorate. It's a very fast-growing area in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        city. With more than 150,000 road users travelling this section daily, this project, when constructed, will benefit local commuters, freight drivers and holiday-makers. Residents in Griffin are crying out for this infrastructure. We've had a lot of rain in Queensland since the new year, the start of 2024, and, when it floods, the intersection at Dohles Rocks Road as you head southbound onto the highway goes underwater. As part of this project, it will be upgraded with an on-ramp north and an off-ramp south.

        Unfortunately, this project is six years overdue. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Dickson,

          He's the local member. We've been waiting for six years for that to start. Guess what? Four months out from the state election, they've got their signs up. They're going to start it. I have to say that in 2018 we secured $120 million of the $150 million needed by the previous federal coalition government. Have a guess what the cost to build it is now. Six years later, it's $290 million. It has gone from $150 million to $290 million. The member for Wannon knows what I'm talking about, because he is from the great state of Victoria. The Queensland government's

          have said that they could have started this project a lot earlier. This should have been done straightaway.

          I want to thank all the local people in Griffin and

          and the area for signing my petition. It's because of your determination and advocacy that we were able to get the state Labor government to start. The upgrade will see north-facing ramps to help increasing traffic and local connectivity. The project will make a big difference to those local communities.

            I can see why as well. The issue is that the people won't forget the inaction of this government over the last nine years and particularly over the last six years. But, as your federal MP, I'll keep advocating for projects that you want.

            Today, two wonderful bowel cancer warriors from my electorate came to visit and advocate about the impacts of this cruel disease. Rachel Bernardo and Jodie Elisara from

             Deception Bay
            </a>
            were both diagnosed with bowel cancer in their 30s. They are beautiful young women who you wouldn't expect to get cancer at such a young age. I was shocked when they told me about their symptoms and the fact that they were dismissed by multiple
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
             GP
            </a>
            s who said they were both too young and not to worry. This is the case for many young people who are later diagnosed with bowel cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the members of this House would know that bowel cancer is the deadliest cancer, and it's the sixth-leading cause of death overall for Australians aged 25 to 44. Early onset bowel cancer in people diagnosed younger than 50 years of age accounts for 11 per cent of all new diagnoses.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
             Bowel Cancer
            </a>
            Australia's Never2Young's advocacy agenda seeks to improve care experiences and health outcomes for younger people by championing: greater awareness; lowering the screening age from 50 to 45 and making sure that it's not opt-in but there for everyone; GP referrals for a colonoscopy for all young people who present with symptoms; improving pathways, better understanding of the challenges of early onset bowel cancer; and further research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too often, young Australians have died of bowel cancer—people that we care about. I lost a friend, Sam Gunsser, to bowel cancer two years ago; he was in his 40s. I encourage constituents, if they'd like, to make a donation to Bowel Cancer Australia. It's 100 per cent community funded. All donations over $2 are tax deductible. They can donate at bowelcanceraustralia.org.
