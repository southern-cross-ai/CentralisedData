        I rise today to pay tribute to an official Queensland great, Nicholas Xynias AO

        . Nick was a dedicated member of the Brisbane community working tirelessly to improve the lives of those from culturally diverse backgrounds. Born in Egypt to Greek parents, he came to Australia in his early 20s. However, feeling homesick, he joined the

        , where his life of volunteering began as a scout leader and, more importantly, he met his future wife. He became involved as a volunteer for many Greek and multicultural organisations. He cofounded the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland and served on its board, including as chairman for many years. He also helped to establish a multicultural nursing home in 1988â€”Berlasco Court at Indooroopilly. Nick was a member of many different committees and councils and was most recently appointed by the Premier to chair the Queensland Multicultural Roundtable. He was personally awarded his

        the Queen. He was also awarded the Order of Australia and Officer of the Order of Australia, as well as being Brisbane's Senior Citizen of the Year in 2008. Although he will be remembered for his dedication to and leadership of the community, Nick was above all a devoted husband to his wife, Pat, a loving father to Rick, Kerry, Angela and Demitri and their partners, Maria, Mark and Julie, and a wonderful grandfather to Nicholas, John, Alexander, Zac and Isabella. He lived life to the full and made every day count.
