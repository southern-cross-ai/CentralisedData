        My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister said in relation to the Adler shotgun:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is not a temporary ban. It is permanent. It is set in stone.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this morning, when asked if it was only temporary, the Prime Minister responded: 'It was always.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Prime Minister want the ban to be permanent, or should we just direct the question to the Leader of the National Party?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. The position on the import ban is very straightforward: it is there until the police ministers of the states and territories agree on the reclassification of lever-action shotguns and, having agreed on it, implement their measures. Then, the import regulations will be adjusted to conform with the classification so agreed on. That was the case with the ban imposed in 2015; it is the case with the ban that was imposed in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         But let's talk about guns at the edge of the issue where it really impacts safety to the utmost. We know that we have the best regulation of guns in the world—thanks to

         and

          Tim Fischer
         </a>
         . The leadership of the coalition ensured that we have the best gun laws and, as I have said many times, we are reminded of the value of our gun laws whenever we see events overseas.

          <p>
           I have asked the opposition to support a minimum mandatory term of imprisonment of at least five years for gun smuggling and trafficking in illegal weapons. The Leader of the Opposition has written to me—I have received the letter in the House. He said: 'There is no convincing evidence to prove mandatory minimum sentencing acts as an effective deterrent.' All right. Well, that is his view now.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's look at the member for Gorton back in 2011—he boasted of introducing, in respect of people smuggling, a mandatory minimum sentence of eight years—or, indeed, the member for Parramatta. She said: 'I am proud to stand to support this bill'.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Importantly, it extends mandatory minimum penalties for people-smuggling—
          </p>
          <p>
           and so it goes on—
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           These amendments demonstrate that the Rudd government is serious about stopping people smugglers.
          </p>
          <p>
           So the reality is that the Labor Party knows that mandatory minimum sentences have a very important deterrent effect. They know that. They supported them in the past when they were in government, but apparently trafficking in illegal firearms is not important enough to warrant them supporting mandatory minimum sentences now. If they are serious about keeping Australians safe—if they are serious about stamping out gun crime—they should support our legislation so that we can stamp out the illegal trafficking in weapons.
