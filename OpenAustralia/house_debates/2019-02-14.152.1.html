       <p>
        I'm always proud to come to Canberra and represent the voices of my community. Sometimes, it means I miss out on attending things that I love to attend. It being the start of the year, spending this week and next week in Canberra has meant that I have been unable to attend a number of student leader induction ceremonies at my local schools. So, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly appointed student leaders of the schools in my community—schools like Woodford, Jinibara, Narangba, Caboolture East, Morayfield East and Dakabin, of course. These are great local schools that give our kids a great education and prepare them for the world that's ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the great work that these schools do, they are being neglected by the Liberal government. Each and every public school in my area is having money ripped out of it by this government. I have been out in the community visiting schools, knocking on doors and calling on locals to hear what they have to say about these millions of dollars of cuts. They are not happy. They are not happy that this government would rather throw money at the top end of town than give a fair go to Australian kids. They are not happy that this government would rather run a protection racquet for the banks than invest in education. They are not happy that this government would rather focus on themselves and this infighting that they are doing than strengthening the public education system of this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        But you know what did make them happy: when I spoke to them and they heard about Labor restoring every single cent that the Liberals have ripped out of their schools. That's what's made them happy. They were happy hearing that Bribie Island State High School will receive $1.5 million more under a Labor government. They were happy to hear that

         Burpengary State School
        </a>
        would receive $860,000 more and that schools like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakabin_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Dakabin State High School
        </a>
        —where I was a teacher's aide—would receive $670,000 of additional investment under a Shorten Labor government. That is nothing to be shouting about other than for joy, if you have a child at one of those schools—to have extra investment in our schools. I notice those on that side of the chamber are awfully, awfully quiet right now, Deputy Speaker. Locals just want a fair go; that's why they want to hear about Labor's fair go—a fair go plan for Australian schools, a fair go for their kids.
