       <p>
        Like a former contributor, I am pleased that, in amongst all of the talk about the rotten budget and the changes to the pensions and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        tax, we can at least talk about some good news in this place. An example of that good news that I wanted to mention today is that Seton College, which services my electorate and is in Mount Gravatt East, on Friday night celebrated its 50th anniversaryâ€”a remarkable achievement for a school that is as wonderful a part of the community as Seton College is.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were very fortunate that, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary, one of the former principals of the school, Sister Marie, who had been a principal of the school from 1977, had flown up to Brisbane from Sydney to address the gathering and to talk to us about the things that had been done at the school during her tenure. I met and spoke with a couple of the former students of Seton on Friday night, and they told me what a special, loving and caring school it had been.
       </p>
       <p>
        So it is a great pleasure to be able to congratulate Seton College on their 50th anniversary. My congratulations particularly to the present principal, Chris Raju, who opened a fantastic ceremony by pointing out that the newest building was being opened that day and by pointing out that further funding was required for a fifth stage of the funding and the building of the school. I would also like to thank Pam Betts who is the
