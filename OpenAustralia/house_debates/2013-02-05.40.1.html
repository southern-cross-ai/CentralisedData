         <p>
          The first is in relation to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Grattan" rel="nofollow">
           Michelle Grattan
          </a>
          of the press gallery. Before there was a female Governor-General, before there was a female Prime Minister—indeed, before you were Speaker, a woman performing that role—Michelle Grattan was there in the press gallery blazing a trail for women in what was, when she joined it, a very blokey industry indeed. What we can say about Michelle Grattan, though, is: any woman who has the nickname 'Cobber' obviously was able to make her own way in this blokey world.
         </p>
         <p>
          Michelle Grattan is a watchword in Australian politics and in the Canberra press gallery for work ethic—anybody who has seen her in the press gallery so early in the morning and so late at night can attest to that—for a very old-fashioned devotion to accuracy—indeed, at an earlier stage in my parliamentary career I would frequently joke with Tim that if my phone went at 10.30 at night then it was Michelle Grattan checking copy for the next day—and for a relentless focus on the facts. She will be sorely missed in the press gallery, having announced, as she has, that she is off to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation" rel="nofollow">
           The Conversation
          </a>
          , so we will get the opportunity of her insights and experience in a different way.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do ask myself in these circumstances, though: 'What explains the timing of this announcement? Who spoke to who about this announcement? Who was consulted about this announcement? And how long can this chaos in the press gallery go on?' I do ask myself these questions. But Michelle does go from the press gallery with the best of our sentiments, and I know she will continue to make a great contribution.
         </p>
         <p>
          On a second matter, Speaker, if I can: I had the absolute delight earlier today to meet with Graham Tuckwell, along with members representing the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
           Australian National University
          </a>
          , the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor. Graham Tuckwell and his wife, Louise, have given $50 million—let me just say it again: $50 million—to the Australian National University for a scholarship program that will provide scholarships of $100,000 for students to meet their residential living expenses. They want to, around the country, find those kids that have just got that absolutely extra-special edge and ability to make a contribution but who would not themselves be able to finance the residential costs of coming to Canberra and studying at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
           ANU
          </a>
          . It is a philanthropic venture of truly awesome scale—$50 million. As soon as I sat down with Graham, I knew that I had found a kindred spirit—someone who shares a passion for education and for ensuring that people get the best opportunities in life. So, with a real sense of thanks, on behalf of the nation, thank you to Graham and Louise Tuckwell; thank you for what you will achieve with this money and thank you for the example that you have given our nation of philanthropy at its best.

          </small>
          <p>
           I, too, wish to congratulate Graham Tuckwell on his extraordinary act of philanthropy. Fifty million dollars to fund scholarships for people who might otherwise be unable to attend one of our finest universities is a truly remarkable gift to our nation. I believe this would be the largest ever philanthropic donation in Australia's history—certainly in education—and an absolutely massive contribution. Let us hope that the extraordinary example of Mr Tuckwell and his family is contagious amongst other Australians with the means to be as generous as they can be to worthy causes.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would be a very different press gallery without
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Grattan" rel="nofollow">
            Michelle Grattan
           </a>
           , but fortunately she is not leaving the press gallery. She may be leaving Fairfax—and I have to say that I think it will be Fairfax's loss to lose Michelle Grattan—but she is not leaving the press gallery. Instead, she will be bringing online journalism to the press gallery in a big way. I think Michelle's presence as the greatest online journalist of the press gallery will certainly enhance the standing of online journalism in the days and weeks and months ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Michelle is rightly acclaimed as a legend. Everyone who has ever been in this place has come to know Michelle. She is the epitome of professionalism. She is an absolute stickler for accuracy. But the great thing about Michelle is that she is a terrific human being. She is the toughest journalist you will ever encounter, but, while she has a very tough mind, a mind like a steel trap, she has a warm and generous heart. Anyone who has children who comes across her knows of Michelle's affection for kids and the respect and the love that she has for families. So I think we can all be grateful that we are going to be seeing a lot of Michelle in the years ahead and that her departure from Fairfax certainly does not mean her departure from the press gallery or this building.
