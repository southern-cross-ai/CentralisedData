        Yesterday, 15 June, was World
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Elder Abuse
        </a>
        Awareness Day, a day designated by the United Nations for the world to voice its opposition to the abuse and suffering inflicted on older people around the world. That people around the world are living longer should be seen as progress. In Australia, over 14 per cent of the population are aged over 65 years, with that figure projected to double by the year 2060. A downside to living longer is that, as people age, they tend to become more dependent on others and more vulnerable. Their vulnerability underlies a very serious and widespread social problem that is rarely acknowledged or openly spoken about, and I refer to elder abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elder abuse can be physical, sexual, financial, emotional, medical or simple neglect. It can occur within the family home or within institutional care facilities. It can even result in violent death, as has occurred in several cases in Australia in recent years. Elder abuse includes parents being pushed into an aged-care facility so that their children can take control of their home and other assets; parents being coaxed or pressured by family members into making financial decisions, including changing their wills, which they would have preferred not to have done; elderly people being seriously neglected in institutional care; elderly people being excessively sedated so that they are easier to care for; elderly people being scammed of their money by family and non-family members; and elderly people living in daily fear because their partner has dementia, or an adult child has a drug dependency problem, both of which can lead to erratic behaviour; and elderly people being targeted as easy victims by petty criminals and drug addicts. These are not isolated examples but common occurrences throughout the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the figures are difficult to ascertain,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organization
        </a>
        data indicates that between four and six per cent of older people are abused each year. Some reports suggest that the figure could be as high as 10 per cent, whilst a recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        study concluded that 1.5 to two million elderly Americans are abused every year. With 4.7 million Australians aged over 65 years, the figures suggest that each year over 200,000 elderly Australians are in some way abused. If that level of abuse were occurring in any other sector of society there would be an understandable public outcry for government intervention. Regrettably, rather than that being the case, public conversation about older people and longevity focuses on medical costs, aged care services and the diminishing ratio of working people to retirees.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the reasons why this issue is brushed aside so often is that about 90 per cent of the abuse is perpetrated by family members, with around two thirds of the perpetrators being adult children of those abused. Out of pride or embarrassment, the abuse is not reported either by the elderly or by other family members who become aware of it; in turn, it is never acted upon. Cultural practices can also be a barrier for victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a society we have rightly taken a strong stance against child abuse and domestic violence by raising public awareness, openly talking about the issue and establishing support mechanisms for those abused. We have not acted similarly against elder abuse and too many elderly people suffer in silence, often living in fear and with a loss of dignity. Here in Australia, other than some compulsory reporting requirements for physical and sexual abuse in residential care facilities, there is no legislation that specifically addresses elder abuse. Under the criminal law there are no specific offences targeting abuses against the aged. There is no excuse for elder abuse nor for turning a blind eye to it. It is not okay. We all have a responsibility to step in and stop it wherever it occurs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to see that today in Adelaide there is a national World Elder Abuse Awareness Day conference. Amongst the several expert presenters speaking at the conference is Dr Alexandre Kalache, who is President of the International Longevity Centre in Brazil and who was in 1997 a founding member of the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse. It was that network that led to the United Nations resolution. It is good to see that this issue is finally being spoken of openly and that some steps are being taken, but, as a society, we need to do a lot more.

          I second the motion. I rise to associate myself with the comments made by the member for Makin and I thank him for his motion. Elder abuse has many facets. In our society, often in the past our elders and those who were ageing were seen as the people to whom you went for advice, support and guidance. Over the last few decades that has changed. We see elements of abuse that are not acceptable. The whole financial construct of the abuse—the humbugging, seeking to take care of your parents and then taking their wealth to build your own—is problematic.
         </p>
         <p>
          Elder abuse, as defined by Seniors Rights Victoria, is:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Elder abuse is any act which causes harm to an older person and is carried out by someone they know and trust such as family or friends.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is normally the gamut of how you would consider it. It is even in terms of some of the unscrupulous behaviour of people who take advantage and work on the fear that they create in the elderly about the safety of their environment and who extract from them commitments to financial arrangements, security systems et cetera. In days gone by, these elders were more able to be strong in their resolution as to their aspirations and dreams; but when you become frail you are at the mercy of others. The problem in our society is that when you become old there is a mindset of ageism and that mindset sees people categorised as 'not of value' and being set aside. I think that is a sad indictment, particularly when those who are vulnerable are subjected to financial, social, physical, sexual and psychological abuse and neglect from those who purport to love and care for them.

          Awareness Day—the day that is bringing us together—is about working together to bring greater recognition of the mistreatment of older people wherever they live and to highlight the need for appropriate action.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           The United Nations
          </a>
          notes that:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The global population of people aged 60 years and older will more than double, from 542 million in 1995 to about 1.2 billion in 2025. Around 4 to 6% of elderly people have experienced some form of maltreatment at home.
         </p>
         <p>
          In my own electorate of Hasluck 18.6 per cent of residents are over the age of 60, which equates to just under 28,000 people according to the 2011 census.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are some subtle elements of abuse as well. One of these is loneliness. You hear of somebody who passes away in a unit and nobody notices that they have not been around and when they are discovered dead in their bed people then ask: 'Where is the family? Where are the relatives who were part of that person's life? Where is the community?' That is a subtle abuse through neglect and through loneliness. Often when we doorknock, as most of us in this chamber do, we meet people who live in poverty and whose physical surrounds show and exemplify neglect. It is sad that at their time of life when they have contributed to the building of a nation that we take for granted and enjoy that they are not the benefactors of what you would expect to be a good retirement or a good time in life. As we reach our senior years, we expect to be able to spend that time in the twilight of our life enjoying family, friends and those around us. We do not need the type of abuse that we are seeing becoming increasingly prevalent.
         </p>
         <p>
          I must admit in a previous role one of my responsibilities was to look at the extent of elder abuse within that jurisdiction, to look at how we address it and to look at what measures there were to protect people who were experiencing elder abuse. Sadly, as the member for Makin indicated, there is no legislation that protects them and there is no concerted effort. It is only through these motions and through these debates that we will continue to raise within the community's conscience the need to address the abuse of elders.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
            Elder Abuse
           </a>
           Awareness Day to the attention of the chamber. It is true that we have an ageing population and in these circumstances it is the case that there are tragic reminders from time to time about the isolation in which many elderly people find themselves. There was a time when I was the shadow minister for ageing and seniors—now many years ago— and when I had the opportunity to visit nursing homes and other facilities that look after elderly Australians right across the country. During that period I was heartened by the hard and passionate work of the staff in those aged-care facilities—everyone from the doctors and nurses to the cleaners and those who maintained those facilities. The compassion they showed for elderly Australians was, indeed, inspirational.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know too that for many elderly people their later years in life are extremely difficult. As the motion indicates, they suffer from physical, mental, emotional, financial and medical neglect from time to time. This is something that occurs throughout the world, and this is why this day is recognised internationally. Abuse of the elderly shocks our community. I certainly come from a culture which respects and puts elderly people up on a pedestal. That is the case throughout Australia, but, unfortunately, we have a circumstance whereby some of our elderly are left very isolated. In my community there are more boarding houses than any other electorate in Australia. These are largely people who do not have family support and do not have friends to call on. That is why it is important that governments continue to play a role in this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
           The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
            World Health Organisation
           </a>
           defines elder abuse as follows:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Elder Abuse is a violation of

            Human Rights
           </a>
           and a significant cause of injury, illness, lost productivity, isolation and despair.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is why, since the mean spirited budget was handed down in May, the recent debate about carers is of such concern. Those who are carers in our community should receive the gratitude and support, not just of those they are caring for, but also of the community as a whole. That is because they are looking after their loved ones and they are treating them with the respect they deserve. In addition to that, of course, they are also saving the government money through that care, which reduces the pressures on our formal aged-care facilities. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to our carers. I conclude by congratulating the member for Makin on this important initiative and say that World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is a day for all of us to re-affirm the respect that we have for older Australians.

           <p>
            I commend the member for Makin on this motion and appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of it. Elder abuse is a growing and insidious problem within our society and, sadly, around the world. Studies indicate that around five per cent of the elderly are the victims of this sort of abuse, though the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Criminology" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Institute of Criminology
            </a>
            states that 'there are likely to be high levels of under reporting' of elder abuse. It is defined by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
             World Health Organisation
            </a>
            as:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            …a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.
           </p>
           <p>
            So we are not talking about random acts of violence by strangers perpetuated against the elderly, although that in itself is quite shocking. But I think far worse is the elder abuse we are discussing today that takes place within a relationship where there is an expectation of trust—and that, sadly, is most common within a family relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Western Australian study on elder abuse conducted in 2002 found that the most commonly-reported abusers were daughters, 22 per cent; sons, 21 per cent; spouses or de factos, 18 per cent; other relatives, 17per cent; and daughters- or sons-in-law, five per cent. It is distressing to think that anyone in a position of trust would abuse that position, but to imagine a loved one, a family member, actually taking advantage of someone in that way is truly appalling. It speaks volumes about the need for us as a society to espouse values such as compassion, caring and responsibility, particularly within the context of our families. We need to ensure that our children do not just learn independence, confidence and self-worth, but also the value of community, accountability and self-sacrifice. That is why it is so very important that we raise awareness of this issue: so that we can send a very clear message that elder abuse is not acceptable and will not be tolerated—just as we say no to domestic abuse on White Ribbon Day.
           </p>
           <p>
            As this motion points out, elder abuse may be physical, sexual, psychological or financial, or may involve neglect. I want to take some time today to discuss the issue of financial abuse, because it is perhaps what some in the community still regard as a grey area. Bruises or ill health are more easily identified than the systematic appropriation of someone's assets. Financial exploitation includes fraud, forgery, forced property transfers and the improper use of legal guardianship arrangements or powers of attorney. The wrongful use of elderly people's assets ranges from a failure to hand over change from a shopping trip to the sale of a relative's home. Some instances involve inadvertent or poor management of funds; some come down to ethical dilemmas of unpaid care; and then there is the pressure of an increasing sense of entitlement from impatient younger relatives—particularly as people live longer lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            A former Adult Guardian of Queensland, Paula Scully was quoted in a 2006 research paper as saying that financial abuse was biggest problem confronting the Queensland Office of the Adult Guardian, which was established to help combat the abuse of adults with impaired capacity. She articulated the attitude she had witnessed:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Some people seem to think that it is perfectly all right to shift an elderly relative into a home and then just take over their assets on the basis that 'granny doesn't need this anymore and we are going to inherit anyhow', and I'm sure that at least some don't see this as any form of abuse at all. Well, it is.
           </p>
