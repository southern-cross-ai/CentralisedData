         I thank for member for her question. I know that the member for Chisholm is very focused on the question of quality education and quality schools in her electorate and that she is aware, as are many people around the country, of the impact of our Teach for Australia program. This program already has 45 of the best and brightest graduates who have undergone a training program teaching in disadvantaged schools around the country, most particularly in Victoria. It is a great quality program. I know that this program is under threat and I know the member who asked me the question is concerned about these threats. The threat arises because the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if he is elected, he will cut the money allocated to the national partnership program that supports Teach for Australia. This has been welcomed by principals, by people who care about education right around the country with words like, ‘I feel like I have won the lottery to have one of these high quality graduates in my school.’
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that the member for Chisholm out in Melbourne’s east has been involved in some community discussions about this question. I know that that community discussion is also continuing in the electorate of Aston. My attention has been drawn to the flyer of the Liberal candidate for Aston,

         . I had a good look at it. I was a little bit intrigued when it said that, among his various claims to fame, he had worked at national level formulating initiatives to give school communities more funding and control. That is interesting. Why is the name ‘Alan Tudge’ familiar? Then it occurred to me—

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I would refer you to the statement that ministers should not engage in irrelevancies, which include contrasting government and opposition positions, which is precisely what she is doing. I would ask you to ask her to sit down.

           The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The question was in order. The question went to any threats. I have a feeling that something is emerging in this answer. The Deputy Prime Minister understands that she must relate the material to the question.

                   The member for O’Connor will resume his seat. His punishment is to stay here in the chamber quietly with us. There will be no more ads for commercial retailers, ads for parts of the standing orders or anything else. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call. She is responding to the question. She now has the chance to complete her response.

                    On Teach for Australia, in this application Mr Tudge tells us all about his involvement and how valuable it is—the very program that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut the money from. That shows how erratic that they are and shows how little that they care about school eduction.

                    This preselection election campaign talks about Mr Tudge’s claims to fame. It says: ‘I helped develop the popular Investing in Our Schools program, which was both practical policy and great assistance to coalition members in their individual seats and their local campaigns.’ When we on this side of the House invest money in schools, we do it for the benefit of schools, not for the political benefit of coalition members. If you ever need to know the difference between this side of the House and that side of the House when it comes to education, have a look at this document. We are about benefiting schools. Mr Tudge and everyone sitting there are about cutting the money that goes to schools. As revealed by the Leader of the Opposition, they are going to cut the

                    , trades training centres, computers in schools and now this teaching quality money as well—those are the things that the opposition threaten with their budget cuts. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition should talk to Mr Tudge about the benefits of Teach for Australia. But we know that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to local schools right around the country.
