        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is working to secure a more prosperous and safe Australia as we continue our recovery from the COVID-19 global pandemic?

         A year ago, there were 169,000 cases of COVID-19 in total around the world and some 6,470 deaths. Today, there are more than 375,000 cases additional daily and an additional 20,000 deaths per day also. It has been quite an extraordinary year. A year ago today, the national cabinet met for the first time officially. This time last year, the borders had already been closed and the incident response centre had already been established, along with the activation of the Incident Response Plan in mid-January. From mid-January, the AHPPC, the medical expert panel, had been meeting daily. The

         was meeting regularly—and many times a day, on occasions—to direct the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. What followed, through the actions of the Expenditure Review Committee and the cabinet, was JobKeeper; JobSeeker; the cash flow boost; apprenticeship support; international freight assistance; domestic airline network support; 'ZooKeeper'; 'AquariumKeeper'; the

         vaccine to produce over 50 million doses. We're one of the few countries in the world that has such a domestic capability to produce that vaccine. We would not have a vaccination program were it not for the foresight of that decision.

         So now, a year later, Australia leads the world out of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 recession, and Australia is recognised. As I met with the Quad leaders for the first time on the weekend, that leadership and that experience here in Australia is recognised around the world. It is the same reason that we have been recognised with the election of Australia's candidate to be the next Secretary-General of the

         in the former finance minister, Minister Cormann. It is why, at the G7, we join other countries in the G7+ dialogue later this year—because Australia is leading the way. The Australian way of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most successful in the world, and our government remains committed to continuing on that path.
