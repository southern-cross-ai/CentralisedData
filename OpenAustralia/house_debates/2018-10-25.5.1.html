       <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a refurbishment of the fit-out at its premises at 6-20 Gladstone Street, Moonee Ponds, Victoria. The proposed fit-out will provide the Australian Taxation Office with considerable advantages in terms of design and operating efficiencies, and proposes to provide contemporary, agile and cost-effective accommodation. The proposed fit-out includes modular work points, collaborative spaces, an updated security system, a computer room, a generator for improved power back-up for computer and security equipment, enhanced conference training and video-conference facilities, bike racks and staff lockers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the project is $35.5 million excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This includes management design fees, construction costs, information and communications technology, furniture, fittings, equipment, contingencies and a provision for escalation. The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants and contractors. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project is anticipated to commence in early 2019 and to be completed committed by 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

         Department of Infrastructure
        </a>
        , Regional Development and Cities, is responsible for the provision, management and operation of port facilities on Christmas Island. Port facilities on Christmas Island support the social and economic wellbeing of the community and support Australia's strategic interests in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        region. Technical investigations and ongoing consultations with major users of the port facilities have identified a range of concerns regarding the safety, capability and adequacy of key elements of the existing port infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed replacement of the wharf crane and mooring systems at the three locations on Christmas Island will address safety and operational risks as well as ensure the adequacy and reliability of critical infrastructure and support for Australia's strategic interests. The proposed works will promote the physical wellbeing, the social welfare and the economic stability of the Christmas Island community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2018-19 budget measure 'Indian Ocean Territoriesâ€”essential infrastructure and air services', the government provided $51.6 million over four years, from 2018-18, to upgrade Commonwealth infrastructure and underwrite essential air services in the Indian Ocean Territories. The measure included $26.2 million over three years, from 2018-19, in capital funding for the project on Christmas Island. This includes the construction costs, the management and design fees, locality allowance and contingencies and escalation allowance. Net operating costs arising after completion of the project are expected to decrease due to the new infrastructure and the removal of the redundant and inoperable infrastructure. Subject to parliamentary approval of the proposed work, construction is planned to commence in mid-April 2019, with staged completion of facilities between mid-April 2020 and mid-February 2021. I commend the motion to the House.
