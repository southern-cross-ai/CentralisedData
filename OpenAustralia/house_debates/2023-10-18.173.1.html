        Raise Our Voice Australia is an initiative that's been running for the last three years, connecting young people in our communities with their local representatives. Each year, young voices are amplified in the parliament, and I'm proud to be taking part once again. The voices of young Australians—their ideas and thoughts—deserve to be heard. It's their future we influence in this House every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the speech is from Zainab, who lives in my community. This is her speech:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Zainab Rezwar and I'm 13 years old.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improving sustainability and addressing climate change would make Australia a better place for future generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This issue is important to discuss and come up with solutions, as improving sustainability and addressing climate change will contribute to lasting global prosperity and stability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes made will influence all of our futures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Parliament will be able to support this by doing the following:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        These solutions, along with public participation, will help the Parliament create a better future for generations to come.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As our leaders, you should help improve sustainability and address climate change before there is no earth to take care of.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Act now before it's too late.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really proud to be able to read Zainab's words, and note that the Albanese government is committed, like her, to making sure we have taken steps to address climate change. However, the voice of young Australians is often ignored, and it's a shame, because we have so much to learn from them.

        That is why I was glad to have recently visited Whiddon care home in Glenfield. There was the sound of children laughing, playing and enjoying morning tea, and listening to Elvis sing, over a barbeque lunch. This was a diverse set of experiences I was treated to when I visited.
       </p>
       <p>
        My visit began with a stop at Arthur Webb Court, where students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Glenwood Public School
        </a>
        were visiting their adoptive grandparents for morning tea and games. The joy on the faces of the young and the not so young was wonderful. Despite the obvious age difference of decades, it was clear that everyone enjoyed their time together and their regular catch-ups; there were certainly lots of hugs and colouring-in going on. I congratulate Principal Jay McInney and his teachers for this initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previously, older students from the school made a chess set for one of their grand-buddies. That was a suitable gift for someone who loved chess, but the arthritis in his hands made it too difficult to play. So they constructed, from 3D printing, chess pieces that he was able to pick up. It was lovely that they were able to come up with these gifts over time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other official reason to be at Whiddon home was to celebrate the 12-month anniversary of the men's shed, which was partially funding by a grant from the federal government's Stronger Communities Program. Over a barbecue lunch, including some more Elvis cover songs, I learned about the positive impact the men's shed is having on the residents of the home. I'd like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Whiddon, Chris Mamarelis, for his kind invitation. Whiddon at Glenfield is making a positive impact on lives both young and old.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to give a big shout-out to the aged-care workers for all they do in aged-care settings all through my electorate but particularly at Whiddon. Their work is invaluable and deserves to be recognised. I acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSU" rel="nofollow">
         HSU
        </a>
        , who fight for our aged-care workers and ensure they can continue to provide care for older Australians in a safe workplace. I'm proud to be part of a government that values our aged-care workers, making sure that there was a recent increase in the pay and there are new mandatory minimum care minutes and free training progress. It was a wonderful time to be out in my electorate. I really enjoyed everything I saw, and I would like to thank them.
