        It's not often in this chamber or in the main House that we discuss cultural or social issues. Maybe that's because it's hard to wrap your head around them. Maybe it's because they're difficult to legislate for. But I did want to stand up today and make comments regarding the reaction that a photo posted by the Prime Minister when he was at a footy match triggered last Saturday. He was watching the Swans play Essendon and, as he sat there, in his left arm, he cuddled his granddaughter Alice. As he kissed her on the forehead, as any loving grandfather would, a photo was taken. The Prime Minister also had, in his right hand, a beer. This prompted a reaction by some keyboard warriors. One said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Does anyone see anything irresponsible with an adult hold(ing) a baby and juggling a beer? And when was drinking while holding a child
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ?
       </p>
       <p>
        Another said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I find it disgusting to see people breathing grog all over baby’s—
       </p>
       <p>
        Et cetera. There is such a thing as a slippery slope. When it comes to cultural and social issues, mainstream Australia needs to stand firm and, at times like this, call out an overreaction for going too far.
