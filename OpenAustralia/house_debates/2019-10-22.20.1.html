       <p>
        Last Sunday, I was back in Barker to officially open the Freeling Agriculture, Recreation and Multi-use Centre, or the FARM centre, as it's known.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia
        </a>
        is critical to our government's plan to drive economic growth and secure more and better paying jobs. Regional Australia is a key driver of the Australian economy and it's important we ensure there remain great places to live. Regions with good infrastructure, good roads, good communications and good services are likely to remain vibrant, strong communities where people want to live and work. Our government is investing $841 million in the Building Better Regions Fund in order to create jobs, drive economic growth and build stronger regional communities into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FARM centre is a perfect example of a project that is doing just that. It's a brand new facility in Australia's animal fodder production bowl that provides a space for agricultural trade shows, events and community sport. Providing a space for export oriented trade shows and events will increase opportunities for local businesses to grow international exports, which will increase production and jobs in the region. As well, there is space for training and education activities and for the fodder industry, which facilitates productivity improvements for local growers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will also deliver social benefits in the region by improving community connections, rural shows, events and sports, including basketball, netball, cricket and the

        . This is a $4.8 million project, supported by $2.1 million in government support and $600,000 from the community. Congratulations to everyone involved.
