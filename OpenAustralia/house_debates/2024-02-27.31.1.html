        is a great day here in this parliament and an exciting week because our government's bigger and better tax plan is on its way to be debated in the Senate. We know how important this tax plan will be to the people of Victoria and, in fact, to the whole of Australia. It means that 84 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under this plan when the Senate passes this bill. Ninety per cent of women taxpayers will now receive a bigger tax cut. Those are the priorities of this government. We are making sure that people will earn more and keep more of what they earn. That is the core of this plan, and that is what we are delivering. Nurses, teachers and truckies will all be better off. Ninety-five per cent of them will get a bigger tax cut because of this plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important things we're doing with this plan is making sure that people on the lowest of incomes actually get a tax cut. So people earning under $45,000 will get a tax cut. Under those opposite, they got nothingâ€”absolutely nothing. That's the priority of those opposite. In our reformed plan, those taxpayers earning under $45,000 will actually get a tax cut. That's the commitment from us. Our plan means that people will earn more and keep more of what they earn. That's what a good, responsible government does in this cost-of-living crisis.
