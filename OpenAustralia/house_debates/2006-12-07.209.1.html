       <p>
        There have been concerns raised by residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Beach
        </a>
        regarding a proposed needle and syringe program to be set up at Palm Beach Community Health Service, and the concerns are certainly understandable. But today I would like to put on the record why such a program is necessary—why it is needed and why governments, both state and federal, would be negligent in their duty of care to residents if this type of service was not available.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the comments being made with regard to the proposed service are: ‘It will attract drug addicts to the area’, ‘The service will only add to the crime sprees the suburb has been grappling with’, ‘The service is going to attract undesirable activity’, ‘A needle exchange says, “Hey, come on in and do drugs here.”’ As I said, I can understand these sentiments being expressed, but I think it is important that residents understand what this proposed service will offer to those people using illicit drugs and how the service will in fact protect our community. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSP" rel="nofollow">
         NSP
        </a>
        is part of Australia’s National Drug Strategy, which is widely recognised as one of the most progressive and respected drug strategies in the world. An evaluation of the strategy showed that the harm minimisation approach was fundamental to its ongoing success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2003-04 federal budget allocated $38.7 million over four years for the continuation of funding under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        illicit drug diversion supporting measures relating to needle and syringe programs for 2003-07: $35.1 million of the funding is provided to states and territories, with the remaining $3.6 million managed by the partnerships and treatment section for national activities. An additional $9.4 million has been allocated to extend the program until 2008. NSP is an important public health measure which aims to prevent the spread of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis C. The NSP provides sterile injecting equipment, education and information on reducing drug use and referral to drug treatment, medical care and legal and social services. Staff may also provide condoms and safe sex education.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Australian government in no way condones the use of illicit drugs, the re-use and sharing of syringes can result in the spread of many infectious diseases, in particular HIV-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        and hepatitis B and C. The larger the pool of people carrying these diseases within the injecting drug population, the greater the risk of transmission to the general population. Any barriers, including cost barriers, which make it more difficult for illicit drug users to obtain syringes increase the risk of transmission of these infectious diseases. Therefore, the free supply of needles and syringes to injecting drug users is a public health measure. I agree with residents: it is a controversial measure. It causes debate around the possible adverse effects the program may have on a community. Unfortunately, it is a public health measure that benefits Australian communities against the spread of infectious diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research has found that the needle and syringe program has fundamentally altered the course of Australia’s HIV epidemic. If these programs were not available I wonder how many needle-stick injuries we would once again be hearing about. Where would the users of illicit drugs leave their used syringes—on our beaches, in our parks, on our streets, in our schools, bus shelters and shopping centres?
       </p>
       <p>
        I put to the residents of Palm Beach that if this service was not available we would run the risk of people in our community coming in contact with contaminated waste that could be highly infectious. The reality is we already have in our community people using illicit drugs. The proposed needle exchange program is not going to attract drug addicts. Unfortunately, the reality is they are already in our community. There is no point burying our heads in the sand and pretending we do not have the same problem with illicit drug use that other communities have. What we need to do as a community is to ensure we have the services and education available to minimise the impact on the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not—and I repeat, I do not—condone the use of illicit drugs. I fully support the coalition Tough on Drugs policy. Through that policy I am aware that a proactive approach is needed to counteract the very serious problem of the re-use and sharing of syringes which can result in the spread of many infectious diseases. I am not about destroying our beautiful beachside suburb; I am, however, about protecting children and their families. I do not want to see any more needle-stick injuries. I am about working with my community to ensure we have the most appropriate service in the most appropriate location to deal with the increasing population. I too take pride in my local area and do not want to see its image maligned, but I am realistic.
       </p>
       <p>
        For some people, personal beliefs and values shape their attitudes towards health interventions. However, there is overwhelming evidence that increasing the availability and utilisation of sterile injecting equipment to injecting drug users contributes substantially to reduction in HIV transmission. There is no convincing evidence of major unintended negative consequences of such programs. I hope as a community we can all work together to ensure this service is delivered in the most appropriate way.
