       <p>
        Over the last few weeks, netball tragics around the world have had the privilege of watching the Netball World Cup, the 15th Netball World Cup. For 56 years the international netball community has come together to see a world cup tournament. Obviously, there have been some fairly dominant leading nations in that competition over time—namely, New Zealand and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want this in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . I've spoken to a lot of people in this building who represent communities around the country about what has to be said was a disappointing result for Australia, a one goal loss to New Zealand in the gold medal match. But it is interesting to note that, over 15 tournaments and 17 match-ups between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        , the combined score for Australia is 759 goals; for New Zealand it is 758 goals. Firstly, we're still winning. Secondly, the competition between these two nations—in this, the ultimate team sport—is the tightest on the planet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unique thing about the game of netball is that it is the absolute team sport. No-one can go coast to coast in netball. There is no goal to goal. There's no 'grab the ball and dribble all the way down the court'. There's no 70-metre run as you bounce the ball. No-one can go coast to coast without their team mates in netball. Netball is the ultimate team sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay homage today to our fabulous young Diamonds team, which worked so hard in this tournament. I want to say too that New Zealand and Australia played one another twice within three days. The first result had Australia winning by one goal; the second result was New Zealand winning by one goal. Both games were absolutely fabulous—the most amazing netball. Both games saw teams come back hard in that second half and just get pipped and not be able to take the lead. It's an extraordinary piece of sporting history.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate the young Diamonds: coach,

       </p>
       <p>
        I want to finish by saying that you did shine bright, that you are confident girls and you are building and empowering women and girls around this nation. I want to congratulate the

        on a fabulous tournament. England of course were great hosts. I want to wish all of the Australian girls around the country, who will be back on the court in the super netball series this weekend, the best of luck.
