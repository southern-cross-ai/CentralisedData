        There are people on this earth who are born with a passion to help others, and Judy King
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        from Smithton in my electorate of Braddon was one such person. Sadly, Judy passed away recently after a long, extended battle with cancer. She was determined to face her battle with courage and had a commitment for many years to blaze a trail to make it easier for others. In 2008, Judy organised the region's first-ever Relay for Life rally. She ran the Cancer Council's

        bus, a transport service for patients who face difficulty getting to and from cancer treatment. Judy also formed the infamous

        </a>
        Bosom Buddies, a support network to help those locals diagnosed with the disease and to fundraise for the

         National Breast Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        . In 2013, Judy was recognised with a

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her services to the Circular Head community. She also made an appearance on the front cover of the 2013-14 North-West Tasmania

        </i>
        as part of the Keeping Our Communities Healthy theme. Judy did more for her community than we will ever know. She has left behind a legacy of care and will be remembered for her love of family and life, together with her desire to offer hope to others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to pass on the sympathies of a grateful electorate to Judy's husband Ian, her children and grandchildren Leesa, Andrew, Cyrus and Nadia Kay, and Jaci, Paul and Alexandra Jones, and the wider Smithton community. Judy was a darling of our community and, sadly, she has left us. But as a beautiful respected Christian woman, she left with a hope of a better future.
