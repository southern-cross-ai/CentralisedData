       <p>
        On this day two years ago I stood in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Reps" rel="nofollow">
         House of Reps
        </a>
        and gave my first speech, as the 1,152nd member elected to this parliament. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve the people of my community for the last two years. When I look back on that first speech that I gave, on the things that I've stood for and said I would serve, I look back with pride, having honoured the things that I said that I would do. I came in here, and I have been the person I said I was going to be. I continue to advocate for the things I believe in, and I do so with the integrity and the passion that I promised I would on behalf of the community that I represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I said, when I came in here, that we needed more women in this place, and I have stood by that. I've become the secretary for the Status of Women Caucus Committee and held consultations all over the country, talking about how we can better serve the women of this country. I instituted the Women of Lindsay Awards, recognising and honouring the women in my electorate who make things better for everybody. I stood up for women, mentoring and supporting themâ€”young women in my electorate. I made sure that I didn't pull the ladder up after myself when I'd finally reached a position but stood there and held it while they continue to climb. I used my position in this House to smash the stereotype that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV" rel="nofollow">
         DV
        </a>
        only happens in certain communities and is limited to a certain stereotype. I made sure that I opened the women's community shelter in my electorate, with the women's community shelter network, and opened
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haven" rel="nofollow">
         The Haven
        </a>
        refuge, and I made sure that I fought for and continue to fight for DV leave so that women and children who need it are given that access. I continue to fight for ensuring that cross-examination in our family court system ends.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my first speech, I talked about making sure that kids with special needs were supported. I stood up for that, making sure that kids knew that not every parliamentarian held the view of some over in the Senate. I've served the inquiry into adoption and the low rates of local adoption: we've got 315 adoptions happening in a year but 48,000 kids in out-of-home care. I made sure that I served the inquiry into the family law court and the impact that family violence has on families. Now we're fighting the inadequate decisions that are being made on the other side to collapse the family law court into the Federal Circuit Court, which actually won't serve anybody, other than to save more money.
       </p>
       <p>
        I said in my first speech that I would advocate for organ and tissue donors. I am proud that I've helped secure the event for the organ and tissue donor games in Brisbane in the next couple of years, and I will go to the launch event in Sydney in a few weeks time. I'm on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        committee, and I continue to serve the committee, listening and working towards a better outcome. I have honoured everything that I said that I would. I finished my first speech with this quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you're going to be passionate about something, be passionate about learning. If you're going to fight something, fight for those in need. If you're going to question something, question authority. If you're going to lose something, lose your inhibitions. If you're going to gain something, gain respect and confidence. And if you're going to hate something, hate the false idea that you are not capable of your dreams.
       </p>
       <p>
        I said it two years ago today, and I still believe in that now.
