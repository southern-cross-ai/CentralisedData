       <p>
        This summer has been a disaster for this Prime Minister, and we have watched in horror as he dials up the smugness to belie that reality. Seeing the actions of the Prime Minister over summer, I was reminded, surprisingly, of the Simpsons. It was like watching Homer chase after his roast pig, where no matter what happened he was trying to reassure himself that everything is okay. I'm in Hawaii while Australia burns—it's still good! People won't shake my hand—it's still good! The member for New England is yelling at clouds—it's still good! Those sports grants are getting called dodgy—it's all good; it's all good! The ag minister's resigned and the Nats are in revolt—it's all good!
       </p>

        Prime Minister, it's not still good. It's not all good. It's not good that your government fails to act on climate change and fails on accountability and transparency. It's time for the Homer Simpson of Australian politics to lift his game. Here is a tip, Prime Minister: try less smirking, more thinking, more leadership and stop pretending everything in the country is fine. This country needs a Prime Minister with a serious face doing some serious work. Please, dial down the smugness and get on with your job.
