       <p>
        Last month I was invited to celebrate the Woodford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub Branch's 100th anniversary with its more than 60 members. It got me thinking about the important role that RSL sub-branches play in the electorate of Longman and in communities across Australia. RSL, of course, stands for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returned_and_Services_League" rel="nofollow">
         Returned and Services League
        </a>
        , which was founded in 1916 in order to ensure a unified approach to addressing the lack of organised repatriation of facilities and medical services available to those returning from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        . Even 104 years later, it remains important to support that RSL on their mission to meet the needs of service men and women who have made and are making sacrifices for our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        RSL sub-branches provide a wide range of activities, advice and support to current and former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        members and their families as well as the local community. This helps veterans connect and bond with other veterans, both past and present. The RSL also preserves the memories of those lost to ensure they are never forgotten, and provides welfare to the sick and wounded. One of the most important roles that the RSL plays is ensuring that younger Australians never forget the sacrifice that ADF personnel have made for our great country. In this, they do a great job. So, if you know of a veteran who could use some support, direct them to their local RSL sub-branch. I know all of the RSL sub-branches in Longman welcome serving and ex-service members with open arms, and the one just down the road from your house will be no different.
