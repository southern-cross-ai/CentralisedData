        Yesterday I attended the 2014

         Inter Dominion
        </a>
        Sydney harness racing carnival at

        , Menangle. The Inter Dominion is harness racing's premier event, and I felt very proud to see it hosted in my electorate again this year. The event has been contested since 1936, rotating around cities across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        . This year's heats were held in Victoria, Queensland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and New Zealand, and the finals are being held at Tabcorp Park, Menangle, for the three consecutive years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 10,000 people attended the event yesterday, and I can tell you that the atmosphere was electric. The day included a 10-race program, fashions on the field and featured seven group-1 races with a pool of more than $2 million in prize money and trophies. The winner of this year's Inter Dominion was Beautide, and his trainer/driver James Rattray—and I am sure, all Tasmanians—are very happy with the result.
       </p>
       <p>
        To have an international event of this standard held in Macarthur is fantastic for local tourism and our economy. I congratulate Tabcorp Park Menangle on the success of this event, which was organised in partnership with the New South Wales state government. I also congratulate the New South Wales Harness Racing Club and Harness Racing New South Wales. As the Federal member for Macarthur I feel very proud to have an event of such high standard held in my electorate for three years running.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chief executive of New South Wales Harness Racing, John Dumesny, has told the local media that the championship was the pinnacle of harness racing events in the southern hemisphere. He said it gave the club great pleasure to host the event in Macarthur. I congratulate John and the chairman of Harness Racing New South Wales, Rex Horne, and the chairman of Tabcorp Park Menangle, Ray Sharman, and its board of directors on a successful carnival this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from the grand final on Sunday, there were several events held in my electorate as part of the Inter Dominion carnival. These included a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        breakfast and lunch with the stars and a golf day as well as heats and a barrier draw for this year's grand final. There was certainly an element of excitement in the air throughout my electorate in the lead-up to yesterday's Inter Dominion—and for good reason. Yesterday was a sensational event, and I stand here today to congratulate everyone involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the Inter Dominion Carnival was a fantastic event yesterday, I would also like to commend Tabcorp Park Menangle as a major contributor to local community groups and sporting associations in my electorate. Over the years, the organisation has donated thousands of dollars to support local organisations. These include: Macarthur Disability Services, the

        , Society 389, St Vincent de Paul Society, and the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, just to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tabcorp Park Menangle is a fantastic corporate citizen of my electorate. The support they give to community groups, charities and organisations of Macarthur sets a great example to other businesses and corporations across the region. I thank them for the part they play in putting my electorate on the map and their contribution to making Macarthur such a great place to visit and live.
