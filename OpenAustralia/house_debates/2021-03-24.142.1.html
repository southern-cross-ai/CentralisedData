        In the pitch dark of night on 6 January 2016, seven crewmen aboard the

         Port Stephens
        </a>
        marine rescue vessel the
        <i>

        ventured into the night. At 2 am, the 32-tonne rescue vessel was hit by a wall of water in cyclonic conditions which tipped the boat onto its port side, throwing the crew on the deck off their feet and causing the boat's propellers to lift out of the water. As the boat righted itself, a second large wave hit, engulfing the crew in water and knocking them off their feet. This is where Laurie Nolan comes into the picture. He is one of the two brave people who have been awarded the

        today in Australia. Laurie was knocked off his feet by that wall of water. He regained his footing and worked to prevent crew members from being further entangled in safety lines and dragged under the water. He then went to the aid of a crewman who had sustained a shoulder injury, by untangling the safety line and moving the injured man off the deck and into the safety of the cabin. Realising another crewman was pinned to the deck by tangled lines, Mr Nolan grabbed a knife from his belt, severed the line and pulled his colleague to his feet inside the cabin, preventing him from drowning. A third large wave then struck the boat, knocking it over and causing one of the engines to stop on the

        . As the boat righted itself, Mr Nolan and the battered crew were able to restart the engine, clear ropes away from the propellers and then begin the arduous five-hour journey back to Port Stephens, battling large waves, cyclone-like headwinds, injuries and severe seasickness. The crew of the race yacht that they went to save made it safely to shore, thankfully, in a life raft.

        Today, I want to acknowledge Laurie Nolan, who was described as 'such a courageous individual' by our Governor-General David Hurley, who said:

       <p class="italic">
        These awards recognise the courageous actions of individuals who, in a moment of danger or peril, chose to act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They were brave, they did not hesitate, and their actions made a difference.
       </p>

        Laurie, you are outstanding, as are Noel Corcoran, Ian Drummond,

I've never been more proud of my local organisation, Marine Rescue Port Stephens. Thank you for volunteering to make our world a safer place.
