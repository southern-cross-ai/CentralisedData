       <p>
        I was dismayed to read in a recent bulletin from the Department of the Senate the following remark on the opening of parliament:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the role of the defence forces at the front of the building … appears to have been increasing over the years, although there is no connection with the operation of the legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        This statement is factually incorrect and wrong in its characterisation of our parliamentary democracy. The ADF has helped open all 44 parliaments by providing guards of honour and gun salutes. I note that in 1948, owing to demobilisation of troops, there was no gun salute but there was still a guard of honour, which was founded by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_College_Duntroon" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important for two reasons that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        be involved with the opening of parliament. First, it acknowledges our Governor-General as the commander-in-chief under the Constitution—it was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Excellency" rel="nofollow">
         Her Excellency
        </a>
        who opened the new session of parliament. Secondly and crucially, the Defence Force is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, including of ministers in the Defence portfolio and the service chiefs, who are accountable under several processes here and in the other place. Every ADF member knows this.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that the opening of the new parliament be marked by the participation of ADF personnel. Blind Freddy can see that this participation is not just colour and pageantry but a significant element in the continuing and rich life of our democracy. I lament that the Department of the Senate does not understand this point and urge them to immediately swot up with their history books.
