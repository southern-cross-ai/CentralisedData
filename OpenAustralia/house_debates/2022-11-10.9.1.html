        Overview of amendments

        3. The amendments to the Bill that are relevant to human rights are outlined below.

       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. Amendment 10 would ensure that State and Territory laws dealing with sexual harassment can operate concurrently with the new provisions prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work. This includes State and Territory anti-discrimination, workplace relations, occupational health and safety, and criminal laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5. Amendments 11-14 would ensure that the Commonwealth can be held vicariously liable for contraventions of the new prohibition on sexual harassment by defence members.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        would only be liable for contraventions in connection with the person's service as a defence member where the Commonwealth could not prove that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Enterprise agreement pre-approval requirements
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6. The amendments would address concerns that the proposed removal of enterprise pre-approval requirements and protections in subsections 180(5) and (6) of the FW Act may negatively impact employees, specifically those who are young, from a culturally and linguistically diverse (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
         CALD

        ) backgrounds or who did not have a bargaining representative for the enterprise agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        7. The amendments would retain these safeguards and require the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWC" rel="nofollow">
         FWC
        </a>
        to be satisfied, as part of determining that an enterprise agreement has been genuinely agreed to by employees, that the employer has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of a proposed enterprise agreement or proposed variation of an agreement, and their effect, are explained to relevant employees in an appropriate manner, taking into account their particular circumstances and needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Human rights implications
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        8. The definition of 'human rights' in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 relates to the core seven
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Right to an effective remedy and right to a fair hearing
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        9. Article 2(3) of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCPR" rel="nofollow">
         ICCPR
        </a>
        and Article 2 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEDAW" rel="nofollow">
         CEDAW
        </a>
        provides the right to an effective remedy for persons who have suffered human rights violations by Australian authorities, as well as persons who have suffered discrimination perpetrated by Australian authorities. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Human Rights Committee
        </a>
        has stated that the right to an effective remedy encompasses an obligation to bring to justice perpetrators of human rights abuses, including discrimination, and also to provide appropriate reparation to the persons who have suffered human rights abuses. Reparation can involve measures including compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, public apologies, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10. Article 14(1) of the ICCPR provides that, in the determination of rights and obligations in a suit at law, all persons have a right to a fair and public hearing before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work amendments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        11. Amendment 10 would promote the right to an effective remedy by ensuring that State or Territory laws that deal with sexual harassment can operate concurrently with Part 3-5A. This would ensure that an aggrieved person could choose the jurisdiction in which they seek a remedy in relation to workplace sexual harassment. The amendments also provide a way to resolve any inconsistencies in orders made under both a State or Territory law and under the FW Act. Existing provisions in the Bill would prevent multiple penalties being imposed on a party in relation to the same conduct under both the FW Act and State or Territory anti-discrimination law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        12. Amendments 11-14 would promote the right to an effective remedy by enabling an aggrieved person to seek a remedy from the Commonwealth in relation to a contravention of the new prohibition on sexual harassment by a defence member, if that contravention is in connection with the person's service as a defence member. This ensures a remedy is available, even where a remedy could not be obtained from the perpetrator themselves, and is consistent with the vicarious liability provisions relating to other employers and principals in the Bill, and in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination" rel="nofollow">

        Act).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        13. This amendment would maintain the proportionality in the existing vicarious liability provisions in the Bill by limiting the ability of an aggrieved person to seek a remedy from the Commonwealth if the Commonwealth took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment from occurring.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Criminal process rights
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        14. Articles 14 and 15 of the ICCPR protect criminal process rights:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <p class="italic">
        Prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work amendments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        15. The amendments to the proposed prohibition of sexual harassment in connection with work do not directly engage rights in relation to criminal process, but they do provide for civil remedies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        16. Amendments 11-14 would amend the vicarious liability provision in the Bill to enable an aggrieved person to seek a remedy from the Commonwealth in relation to a contravention of the new prohibition on sexual harassment by a defence member, if that contravention was in connection with the person's service as a defence member. This is necessary to ensure that the Commonwealth would be jointly responsible for compensation in these situations, in circumstances where it has not taken all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment. The amendments are proportionate as it does not apply if the Commonwealth proves that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        17. The amendments would ensure consistency with the SD Act, which provides for the vicarious liability of the Commonwealth for sexual harassment perpetrated by defence members, and includes the reasonable steps exemption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        18. Amendment 10 would preserve the concurrent operation of state and territory laws that deal with sexual harassment. This will not expose respondents to a risk of double punishment. As noted in the provision, generally section 734B prevents multiple applications or complaints being brought under the FW Act and state and territory anti-discrimination laws. In addition, Division 4 of Part 4-1 provides rules governing the interaction between civil and criminal proceedings, and civil double jeopardy.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICESCR" rel="nofollow">
         ICESCR
        </a>
        requires the state parties to the Covenant to recognise the right to work and to take appropriate steps to safeguard this right. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has started that the right to work in Article 6(1) encompasses the need to provide the worker with just and favourable conditions of work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        20. The United Nations Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights in General Comment 18 has also stated that the right to work includes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        the right not to be deprived of work unfairly. This definition underlines the fact that respect for the individual and his dignity is expressed through the freedom of the individual regarding the choice to work, while emphasizing the importance of work for personal development as well as for social and economic inclusion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        21. There can also be no discrimination in access to and maintenance of employment on the grounds enumerated in Article 2(2) of the ICESCR.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        22. Article 7 of the ICESCR requires the state parties to the Covenant to recognise the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable working conditions.

        with Human Rights was prepared for the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 (the Bill). In addition to the human rights identified in the original Statement, the amendments would further support the right to work and to just and favourable conditions of work by retaining an important employee safeguard which requires an employer to explain the terms of a proposed enterprise agreement, and their effect to relevant employees in a manner that is appropriate to their needs and circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        24. The amendments would positively engage and be compatible with the right to just and favourable conditions of work by ensuring that employees who are young, from CALD backgrounds or who did not have a bargaining representative during the bargaining process have an opportunity to understand the proposed terms and conditions that would cover their employment, so that they make an informed decision as to whether to vote for the proposed enterprise agreement.

         Right to equality and non-discrimination

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        25. Both the ICCPR (Article 2(1)) and the ICESCR (Article 2(2)) requires state parties to the Covenants to guarantee that the rights set out in these covenants are exercised without discrimination of any kind, including on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        26. Article 26 of the ICCPR further provides that state parties must ensure that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled, without any discrimination, to the equal protection of the law.

       <p class="italic">
        27. The amendments would positively engage and be compatible with the right to equality and non-discrimination by ensuring that employees who have a particular attribute (for example, young employees, or employees from a CALD background) are provided tailored and appropriate explanations about a proposed enterprise agreement that may cover their employment, so that they may cast an informed vote either for or against the proposed agreement. The amendments would ensure that these employees are provided an equal opportunity to understand a proposed enterprise agreement, in the same way as employees who may not have those particular attributes.

        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        28. The Bill is compatible with human rights because it promotes human rights, including civil, political, social, economic and labour rights. To the extent that it may limit human rights, those limitations are reasonable, necessary and proportionate.

       <p class="italic">
        3. This amendment would insert new proposed paragraph 333E(5)(d), which would prohibit the use of a third or more fixed term contract where an employee has previously been engaged on two consecutive contracts for the same or similar work. For the prohibition to apply, there must be substantial continuity between all three or more of the contracts. This amendment clarifies that the prohibition applies when the employment relationship exceeds two contracts, even if it does not also exceed two years in duration.

        4. This amendment would insert a further anti-avoidance provision at new paragraph 333H(1)(ba). This provision would prohibit an employer from ending one employee's employment in accordance with the terms of their fixed term contract, and engaging another employee to do the same or similar work. In order for this provision to apply to an employer's decision to terminate an employee's employment, the employer must have made the decision so as to avoid the operation of section 333E.

        8. Due to the interaction between Part 14 (Enterprise agreement approval) and Part 21 (Single interest employer authorisations) of Schedule 1 to the Bill, this amendment would have the effect of aligning commencement of those Parts. Part 21 commences at the same time as Part 20.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10. New section 180A provides that before requesting employees to approve such an agreement by voting for it, the employer must obtain written agreement to the making of the request from each bargaining representative for the agreement that is an employee organisation.

        12. Currently, whether an employer's failure to notify or obtain the agreement of bargaining representatives prior to putting an enterprise agreement to a vote amounts to a breach of the good faith bargaining requirements in section 228 of the FW Act depends on the particular circumstances (see, e.g.,

        13. This amendment would insert new subsection 188(2A), which provides that the FWC cannot be satisfied that a multi-enterprise agreement has been genuinely agreed to by the relevant employees unless it is satisfied that the employer complied with new section 180A, i.e., unless the employer obtained the written agreement of bargaining representatives that are employee organisations to put the agreement to a vote.

        15. Amendments 33 and 36 would amend new subsection 188(5) to provide that in determining whether an enterprise agreement has been genuinely agreed to, the FWC's discretion to disregard minor procedural or technical errors (if employees were not likely to have been disadvantaged by the errors) applies to the requirement in new section 180A.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        16. Amendment 37 inserts new section 207A, which would introduce a similar requirement for employers to obtain written agreement from relevant employee organisations prior to requesting employees to approve a proposed variation of a multi-enterprise agreement under Subdivision A of Division 7 of the FW Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        17. New section 207A provides that before an employer requests (under subsection 208(1)) that employees approve a variation of a multi-enterprise agreement by voting for it, the employer must obtain written agreement to the making of the request from each employee organisation covered by the enterprise agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        18. Amendment 40 is a consequential amendment and ensures that compliance with new section 207A is a condition of the FWC being satisfied that the variation has been genuinely agreed to by the relevant employees (subject to the FWC's discretion to disregard minor procedural or technical errors if employees were not likely to have been disadvantaged by the errors).

        Amendment 46: Schedule 1, item 531, page 166 (after line 6), after paragraph 211(4A)(a)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        25. This is a technical amendment, which would reflect that when the BOOT is applied to a variation of an enterprise agreement under Subdivision A of Division 7 of the FW Act, there are no longer any bargaining representatives for the agreement. The effect of this amendment is that the FWC must give consideration to any views relating to whether the agreement passes the BOOT that have been expressed by the relevant employer or employers, employees, and any employee organisations covered by the agreement. The FWC must also give primary consideration to any common view that has been expressed by the relevant employer or employers and any employee organisations that are covered by the agreement.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        26. This amendment would provide that if the FWC intends to specify an amendment to a variation of an enterprise agreement that is necessary to address a concern about the BOOT, then the FWC "must", rather than "may", seek the views of the relevant employer or employers and employee organisations covered by the agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendment 49: Schedule 1, item 534, page 167 (line 17) to page 168 (line 6)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        27. This amendment to the Bill would substitute a new section 227A, concerning applications for the FWC to reconsider whether an agreement passes the BOOT.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        28. To address the possible scenario of an enterprise agreement passing the BOOT in circumstances where it provided globally more favourable terms and conditions for 'original employees' and less favourable terms and conditions for 'new employees' (that would not pass the BOOT if prospective employees were considered as a cohort at this time) who are doing the same work, new subsection 227A(3) would provide an additional basis for accessing the BOOT reconsideration process. BOOT reconsideration would also be available to 'new employees' in circumstances where the terms of the enterprise agreement applying to them are not the same as those applying to the 'original employees' if they engage in the same patterns or kinds of work, or types of employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        29. The effect of new subsection 227A(4) is that while BOOT reconsideration is based on an earlier 'test time' (either the time of the original application for approval of the enterprise agreement or the time of a subsequent application to vary the agreement), the relevant employees must still be 'award covered employees' for the agreement at the time of the application for reconsideration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        30. While the FWC must give consideration to the views of the parties, and primary consideration to a common view in certain circumstances, the FWC remains required to undertake its own independent assessment in applying the BOOT pursuant to section 193A.

        Amendment 50: Schedule 1, item 534, page 168 (lines 12 to 22), omit subsection 227B(2)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        31. This amendment would substitute new subsections 227B(2) and 227B(2A), concerning FWC reconsideration of whether an enterprise agreement passes the BOOT.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        32. New paragraph 227B(2)(a) is intended to remove any doubt that employees who are 'award covered employees' for the agreement at the time of the application for reconsideration should also be considered award covered employees, under paragraphs 193(4)(a) and (b), for the purpose of the reconsideration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        33. The effect of paragraph 227B(2)(b) and subsection 227B(2A) is that the 'test time' for a reconsideration of whether an enterprise agreement passes the BOOT is the time the original application for approval of the agreement was made, or—if the FWC has approved one or more variations under section 211—the time the application for approval of the most recent of those variations was made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        34. Paragraph 227B(2)(c) would clarify that BOOT reconsideration is not available in respect of a greenfields agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        35. Paragraphs 227B(2)(d)-(f) are technical amendments to reflect that at the stage of a reconsideration, there are no longer bargaining representatives for the agreement.

        41. This amendment would make three changes to the Bill. The first change is to amend the heading of Division 3 as a consequence of the further amendments made by this amendment. The second change is a technical change to omit Items 577 and 578 from the Bill. These Items are not necessary as amendments to achieve the same outcome are at Items 625 and 626 in Part 20. The Items in Part 20 would preclude protected industrial action being taken in relation to a cooperative workplace agreement. Part 20 commences at the same time as Part 23, which defines 'a cooperative workplace agreement' at Item 642. Parts 20 and 23 need to commence before Part 19 as 'cooperative workplace agreement' would need to be defined for Part 3-3 of the FW Act before Part 19 commenced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        42. New section 437A would require the FWC to issue one PAB order in relation to the employees for each employer when dealing with bargaining for a multi-enterprise agreement. This means that any protected industrial action arising out of the ballot would be conducted on an employer-by-employer basis. The amendments would not apply to related employers, as they continue to make single-enterprise agreements (see item 82, which inserts new item 627B in the Bill).

        43. This amendment is a consequential amendment following the classification of both 'single interest employer agreements' and 'supported bargaining agreements' by other amendments as 'multi-enterprise agreements'. Item 579 would then provide that if the proposed enterprise agreement is a multi-enterprise agreement, employees are required to provide a minimum of 120 hours' notice before industrial action commences.

       <p class="italic">
        93. Item 659A of new Part 25A would amend section 12 of the FW Act to insert definitions of 'Industry Minister' and 'Infrastructure Minister'. These amendments are consequential to the amendments made by item 659B.

        95. The function of the Forum, contained in new section 789GZD, would give the Forum a broad remit to provide advice to the Government on matters relating to work in the building and construction industry that are either raised by Government or agreed by the members. New subsection 789GZD(2) would provide a non-exhaustive list of matters that the Forum may provide advice on.
       </p>

        97. New subsection 789GZE(2) would require the Minister to appoint one or more members who have experience representing employees in the building and construction industry, and an equal number of members who have experience representing employers in the building and construction industry, including at least one member who has experience representing contractors in the building and construction industry. This is to ensure equal representation by employee and employer/contractor representatives on the Forum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        98. New subsection 789GZE(3) would give the Minister a broad discretion to also appoint other persons as members of the Forum, which might include relevant statutory appointees, representatives of community groups (e.g. disability or women's representative groups) or other persons with experience relevant to the functions of the Forum.

       <p class="italic">
        99. Appointments to the Forum would be on a part-time basis and for an initial period of up to three years (section 789GZF). A note explains that a member would be eligible for reappointment at the end of their term.

       <p class="italic">
        100. None of the members of the Forum would be entitled to receive any additional payments or allowances in respect of their membership of the forum, with the exception that a member who is not a Minister or a member of the Parliament would be entitled to receive travel allowance to attend meetings at the rate prescribed by the regulations (new section 789GZM). New subsection 789GZM(3) would make it clear that section 789GZM does not affect any entitlements of a Minister or a member of the Parliament under the

       <p class="italic">
        102. Appointed members could resign by giving the Chair a written resignation (new section 789GZN) and could have their appointment terminated by the Minister on the grounds of misbehaviour, incapacity, bankruptcy etc., loss of position or qualification that formed the basis of the reason for their appointment, failure to comply with confidentiality or interest disclosure obligations or absence from three consecutive meetings without the approval of the Chair (new section 789GZQ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        103. New section 789GZG would provide that the Minister is the Chair of the Forum. However, if the Minister is unable to preside at a meeting, or considers it appropriate to do so for any other reason, the Minister may nominate another Minister to preside at that meeting and the relevant Minister would be permitted to do so.

New subsection 789GZH(4) would make it clear that the procedure to be followed at Forum meetings is to be determined by the Chair in consultation with the members.

       <p class="italic">
        105. New section 789GZK would provide that if any member of the Forum is unable to attend a meeting, they would be permitted to nominate a person to attend in their place and, if the Chair agrees, that person may attend the meeting as a substitute member. The substitute member would have all the rights and responsibilities of a member at, and in respect of, the meeting, including disclosure of interest and confidentiality obligations.

       <p class="italic">
        106. After consulting with the other members of the Forum, the Chair would be permitted to invite a person, body or organisation that is not a member to participate in a particular meeting and could terminate that invitation at any time. An invited participant would be entitled to receive travel allowance as if the person was a member. However, the participation of a person in a meeting does not make that person a member (new section 789GZL).

       <p class="italic">
        107. All members, substitute members and invited participants would be subject to an obligation to keep views expressed during meetings confidential, but this would not prevent members from reporting to the persons, bodies or organisations they represent or from making announcements the members agree are in the public interest (new section 789GZJ).

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        111. This amendment would insert clause 527CA into new Part 3-5A of the FW Act. Part 3-5A would be inserted by Part 8 of Schedule 1 to the Bill and would prohibit sexual harassment in connection with work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        112. Clause 527CA is intended to preserve the concurrent operation of State and Territory laws dealing with sexual harassment and addresses potential interaction issues that may arise because of section 109 of the Constitution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        113. Section 109 of the Constitution renders inoperative a State law to the extent that it is inconsistent with a Commonwealth law. If the Commonwealth law is interpreted as operating to the exclusion of a State law, the State law will be interpreted as inconsistent with the Commonwealth law. While section 109 of the Constitution does not apply to Territory laws, similar principles apply in relation to the inconsistency of Territory laws with Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        114. Clause 527CA is intended to be used in interpreting the operation and effect of new Part 3-5A. It would indicate Parliament's intention that State and Territory laws dealing with sexual harassment can operate concurrently with Part 3-5A. This includes State and Territory anti-discrimination laws, workplace relations laws, occupational health and safety laws, and criminal laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        115. Subclause 527CA(1) would provide that Part 3-5A does not exclude or limit the operation of a law of a State or Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with the Part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        116. Subclauses 527CA(2) and (3) would provide examples of State and Territory laws that could operate concurrently with Part 3-5A, without limiting the general rule in subclause 527CA(1).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        117. Subclause 527CA(2) would clarify that Part 3-5A would not exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a State or Territory law that makes an act or omission an offence, or subject to a civil penalty, where that act or omission (or any similar act or omission) would also constitute a contravention of Part 3-5A. For example, this would enable the concurrent operation of prohibitions on workplace sexual harassment in State or Territory anti-discrimination law or State or Territory laws criminalising sexual assault.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        118. Subclause 527CA(3) would clarify that Part 3-5A does not exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a State or Territory law that allows an application to be made to a person, court or body for an order, or any other direction (however described), to prevent sexual harassment, or to deal with a dispute about sexual harassment. For example, this would preserve the concurrent operation of State or Territory laws that enable a tribunal to issue a stop sexual harassment order.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        119. It would be irrelevant whether sexual harassment has a different meaning for the purposes of the State or Territory law to the meaning used in the FW Act, or whether the State or Territory law describes the conduct as sexual harassment. For example, State or Territory laws that deal with sexual harassment would be preserved, even if they use a different definition of sexual harassment to the definition that applies for the purposes of the FW Act. State and Territory laws would also be preserved even if they do not specifically apply to sexual harassment. For example, if sexual harassment also constitutes bullying, then a State or Territory law allowing orders to be made to prevent bullying could operate despite Part 3-5A.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        120. A new legislative note would alert the reader that new section 734B, which would be inserted by Part 8 of Schedule 1 to the Bill, would generally prevent multiple applications or complaints under both the FW Act and State and Territory anti-discrimination laws in relation to the same conduct.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        121. However, multiple orders covering the same conduct could be made at both the State or Territory and Commonwealth levels, for example, to stop workplace sexual harassment from continuing. In that circumstance, another legislative note would alert the reader that, due to the operation of section 109 of the Constitution, the order made under the FW Act would prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        122. Subclause 527CA(4) would clarify that section 26 of the FW Act has effect subject to clause 527CA. This would indicate Parliament's intention that section 26 does not exclude State or Territory laws to the extent they are preserved by clause 527CA.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        124. The amendments are necessary because the existing vicarious liability provision in the Bill may not apply in relation to contraventions by defence members due to the special nature of defence service, which is not employment and also may not be an agency relationship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        125. Consistent with the operation of the vicarious liability provision as it applies to employers and other principals, the Commonwealth would not be vicariously liable for actions of defence members if the Commonwealth proved that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        126. The amendments ensure consistency with the SD Act, which provides for the vicarious liability of the Commonwealth for sexual harassment perpetrated by defence members, and includes the reasonable steps exemption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        127. The amendments would also make technical updates to the vicarious liability provision to improve the readability of the clause and clarify that the new subclause providing for the vicarious liability of the Commonwealth for acts of defence members does not limit sections 550 and 793 of the FW Act. Sections 550 and 793 deal with third party involvement in a contravention and liabilities of bodies corporate, respectively.

        130. This amendment would insert a note at the end of subsection 65A(5) (which sets out a non-exhaustive list of reasonable business grounds for refusing a request for a flexible working arrangement). The note would make clear that the size and nature of the enterprise carried out by the employer is among the specific circumstances that may be considered when considering whether the employer has reasonable business grounds for refusing the request. This recognises that what is reasonable to accommodate may differ significantly between businesses, depending on their circumstances. The note also provides a relevant example.

       <p class="italic">
        131. This amendment would insert new subsection 65C(2A) into the Act, which would clarify that the FWC cannot make an order:
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        that would be inconsistent with a provision of the Act or a fair work instrument that applies to the employee and employer (other than a previous order made by the FWC under these provisions). This amendment is modelled on existing subsection 739(5), which applies to FWC consent arbitration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        132. One situation in which this may arise is where a fair work instrument provides for rates of pay, penalty rates or other conditions that apply to certain patterns of work. An order of the FWC may not be inconsistent with or less favourable than those provisions. For example, an enterprise agreement may provide that firefighters working non-standard roster patterns get paid at the same rate as firefighters working on a 10/14 shift roster. An order of the FWC could not provide for a rate of pay for the non-standard roster pattern that was inconsistent with this requirement.

New subsection 226(1) of the FW Act would provide that the FWC must (on application) terminate an enterprise agreement that has passed its nominal expiry date if satisfied that any of three grounds have been met. Broadly, the grounds for termination relate to the continued operation of the agreement being unfair for employees, the agreement being unlikely to cover any employees, or the continued operation of the agreement posing a significant threat to the viability of a business (subject to certain other requirements and safeguards for employees having been met).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        135. This amendment would insert new subsection 226(1A), which provides that the FWC must terminate the enterprise agreement under subsection 226(1) only if satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to do so (provided that the criteria in subsection 226(1) are met).

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        146. New item 627A would update the guide to Part 2-4 of the FW Act to remove the sentence which specifies that the effect of a single interest authorisation is that the employers specified in the authorisation are single interest employers in relation to a proposed agreement.

        147. New item 627B would amend subsections 172(2) and (3) of the FW Act to omit references to the term "single interest employers" and substitute them with "related employers".

       <p class="italic">
        148. New item 627C would repeal subsection 172(5) which specifies when two or more employers are single interest employers. The item would then insert new subsections 172(5) and (5A). New subsection 172(5) would provide that despite any other provision of Part 2-4, if an employer is specified in a single interest employer authorisation that is in operation, the only kind of enterprise agreement the employer may make with their employees who are specified in the authorisation is a single interest employer agreement, and the employer must not initiate bargaining, agree to bargain, or be required to bargain with those employees for any other kind of enterprise agreement. New subsection 172(5A) would provide that two or more employers are related employers if the employers are engaged in a joint venture or common enterprise; or the employers are related bodies corporate. These employers will continue to make single-enterprise agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        149. The combined effect of Amendment 82 is that the concept of single interest employers will be removed from the FW Act. Only an employer, or two or more employers that are related employers may make a single enterprise agreement with relevant employees and one or more relevant employee organisations. Two or more employers that are not all related employers may make a multi-enterprise agreement with relevant employees and one or more relevant employee organisations. This means that employers that are specified in a single interest employer authorisation that is in operation in relation to a proposed enterprise will ultimately make a type of multi-enterprise agreement (a single interest employer agreement) with the relevant employees and employee organisations, subject to the transitional arrangements.

New section 216DC would more clearly delineate the requirements of which the FWC must be satisfied before approving a variation of a single interest employer agreement to cover a new employer and its employees depending on whether the application for the variation was made by the employer and its employees, or an employee organisation. It would also clarify the requirements of which the FWC must be satisfied depending on whether the single interest employer agreement covers common interest employers or franchisees. The term 'common interest employers' would be introduced by these amendments and used to identify those single interest employers who are not franchisees.

In performing its functions or exercising its powers generally under the FW Act, the FWC is required to have regard to the objects of the FW Act and the objects of any relevant Part of the FW Act (in existing section 578(a)). For example, when considering whether it would be contrary to the public interest to approve the variation, the FWC would have regard to the objects of the FW Act (contained in section 3), such as whether making the variation will promote productivity and economic growth while being fair to working Australians, and the objects of Part 2-4 (contained in section 171), such as whether approving the variation promotes collective bargaining in good faith, particularly at the enterprise level.

        162. Subsection 216DC(3B) would provide that despite new subsection 249(1), the FWC may refuse to approve the variation if the FWC is satisfied that the employer, or a bargaining representative of the employer, and an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more of the affected employees have agreed that:
       </p>
       <ul>

       <p class="italic">
        163. For the purposes of paragraph 216DC(3B)(b), an employer is likely to have a history of effectively bargaining in relation to one or more enterprise agreements if one or more of those resulting enterprise agreements provided for terms and conditions that were more than a marginal improvement on those contained in the relevant award (i.e. they must do more than simply pass the BOOT).The requirement would operate so that only enterprise agreements that provide genuine benefits to both the employer/s and their relevant employees would be relevant to the FWC's decision to exercise its discretion not to vary the agreement to add the employer and its relevant employees. This discretion would not need to be relied upon where the parties have agreed (in writing) to bargain for a single-enterprise agreement as these parties would be excluded under proposed section 216DC(1C)(b).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        164. Overall, new subsection 216DC(3B) would provide the FWC discretion to refuse an application for a variation of a single interest employer agreement to cover a new employer and its employees, even if the requirements in subsection 216DC(1) are met, if the FWC is satisfied that the variation should not be made having regard to current bargaining. The subsection would uphold and respect the ability of an employer to bargain with affected employees in appropriate circumstances.

New item 630B would insert a new subsection 240(2)(c) to provide that a unilateral application for the FWC to deal with a bargaining dispute may also be made if the proposed agreement is a multi-enterprise agreement in relation to which a single interest employer authorisation is in operation.

The repeal of this Note 1 is consequential on the change of a single interest employer agreement to a multi-enterprise agreement. Note 2 provided that a person cannot be a bargaining representative if they are excluded for the purposes of the agreement by an order under new section 178C.

The requirement would operate so that only enterprise agreements that provide genuine benefits to both the employer/s and their relevant employees would be relevant to the FWC's decision to exercise its discretion not to vary the agreement to add the employer and its relevant employees.

       <p class="italic">
        229. New item 513B of the FW Act would insert new paragraph 211(3)(fa) into the FW Act. This paragraph would provide that when the FWC is deciding whether it must approve a variation of an enterprise agreement, it must take into account section 180 (which deals with preapproval steps) which has effect as if subsections 180(4A)-(4C) (which deal with provision of disclosable benefits documents) and the word "bargaining" in paragraph 180(6)(c) were omitted. The practical effect of new item 513B would be that the FWC does not need to be satisfied that subsections 180(4A)-(4C) have been met for the proposed variation of an enterprise agreement.

These new paragraphs would provide that when the FWC is to determine whether it is satisfied that a variation of a supported bargaining agreement, single interest employer agreement or cooperative workplace agreement to cover a new employer and its employees has been genuinely agreed to in accordance with section 188 (which deals with genuine agreement), subsections 188(4A) and (5) are to apply as if references to subsection 180(5) were references to section 216AAA, 216DAA or 216CAA as applicable. New paragraphs 216AD(1)(f), 216DD(1)(f) and 216CC(1)(f) are inserted into the FW Act and provide in determining whether minor errors may be disregarded under new subsection 188(5) inserted by Item 509 of the Bill, references to when an enterprise agreement is made are instead references to when the relevant variation is made. The practical effect of these amendments is that before determining that a variation of one of these types has been genuinely agreed to, the FWC must be satisfied that the employer has explained the terms of the supported bargaining agreement, single interest employer agreement or cooperative workplace agreement and their effect to employees in a manner appropriate to their circumstances and needs, prior to the vote for the variation.

Similarly, an order made by the FWC in these circumstances would not amount to coercion.

In other words, amendment 5 would modify this definition by inserting the words "by the employer" after "employed".

        This bill will get wages moving. It will streamline the process for single enterprise bargaining to incentivise greater take up by employers and employees. Employers and employees are better off on enterprise agreements, and it's that simple. For businesses and employees unable to access single enterprise bargaining, the bill creates flexible options for multi-employer bargaining.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes will update our workplace laws to bring employers and employees together to improve wages, conditions and productivity. Since the introduction of these reforms on 27 October, my department and I have continued to consult closely with businesses and unions. These amendments make sensible changes to the bill to address issues arising during consultation. At the request of business, the following key changes have been made.
       </p>
       <p>
        First of all, on the primacy of single enterprise agreements: under our amendments, employers who have agreed with an employee organisation to start bargaining for a single enterprise agreement are exempt from the single interest stream. This is in addition to the existing exemption for employers with an in-term agreement. In a further change, the Fair Work Commission will have the capacity for up to six months, after the expiry of an agreement, to exempt an employer from the single interest stream where the employer has a history of effective bargaining. These changes will allow businesses who successfully bargain at the enterprise level to continue to do so and act as a strong incentive for new single enterprise agreements to be made.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further changes with respect to voting: to address concerns that were raised in consultation, primarily with business, we'll amend the bill to clarify that all voting processes under the new single interest and supported bargaining streams will occur on an employer-by-employer basis. This means that an employer cannot be brought to the table to bargain or be covered by a multi-employer agreement unless either a majority of its own workforce or the employer itself supports this. It means that industrial action, where it is permitted, cannot occur where the workers for that employer have not voted for it. Current rules for employers with existing single interest agreements or who have applied for a declaration or an authorisation prior to the commencement of provisions will be preserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under our amendments, we will require a minimum period of good-faith bargaining before an intractable bargaining declaration can be issued by the Fair Work Commission. We'll replace the record of noncompliance exclusion from multi-employer bargaining with an exclusion of the commercial building and construction industry as a whole. This step is not taken lightly, but we do not believe that it is appropriate or necessary to extend multi-employer bargaining to this industry at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our amendments establish the new National Construction Industry Forum as a statutory advisory body aimed at bringing unions, employers and government to the same table to promote positive cultural change in the sector. I want to thank the

        <p>
         The opposition will be opposing these amendments. It's quite an extraordinary feat, but they make a bad bill even worse. Let's be clear what's happening here. The process here has been absolutely appalling. A 243-page bill containing extensive, detailed provisions was released the week before last. Yesterday afternoon the government released 34 pages of additional amendments—around 150 amendments. This is a hopeless and chaotic process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's be absolutely clear about one of the specific provisions in the amendments the government has released because their union paymasters have been onto the Leader of the House and said: 'Sorry, that's not enough. We need more.' Specifically, there are provisions in these amendments which give unions the power to veto deals that have been done—enterprise agreements that have been done—when a so-called 'bargaining representative', that's to say a union official, declines to give consent to an agreement that has been reached between an employer and the majority of its employees. That is, of itself enough, for the opposition to be trenchantly opposed to this amendment, as we are trenchantly opposed to the totality of the bill that is before the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've had the Leader of the House seeking to give the impression that there's been consultation. He's put on his most reasonable voice, which should put everybody on notice. Let's be absolutely clear about what has been said by industry peak bodies:

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">

         The Bill, as currently framed, should not be passed by Parliament.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We jointly call on the Government to permit time for a thorough consideration of the content and implications of the Bill. This deeper consideration should include removing the provisions to allow widespread use of multi-employer bargaining backed by strike action. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Parliament
         </a>
         should remain open to making further amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         And here's another very interesting observation made by these organisations which flies entirely in the face of the honeyed words of the Leader of the House, seeking to give the impression that there's been consultation, that all is in agreement. These organisations say that the legislation as drafted does not reflect broad consensus arising out of engagement with industry at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs" rel="nofollow">
          Jobs
         </a>
         and Skills Summit or subsequent consultations. These are bodies representing the major prosperity-generating sectors of the Australian economy, the major employment-generating sectors of the Australian economy. They are saying very clearly that more time is needed, and they are fundamentally opposed, as is clear, to a number of elements of this bill. They particularly highlight the provisions in the bill that would allow widespread use of multi-employer bargaining by strike action.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's be clear what is before the House, both in the substantive bill and in the amendments that were circulated yesterday. It is putting Australia at risk of returning to the bad old days of the 1970s, with repeated strike action and a sluggish and unproductive economy. The bill and the amendments make it worse, because they further weaken the arrangements in relation to enterprise agreements because they allow a union to veto such an agreement, even when there has been a vote in favour of it by employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some minor window-dressing concessions in here, but the simple fact is that this is a very bad bill, taking the Australian economy and our society and our community backwards—extraordinarily. You would have thought it was hard to achieve but, extraordinarily, the amendments make a bad situation worse, and the opposition will be opposing the government's amendments as we opposed the bill.

So, while I do commend the government, because I know they've been working very hard to try to engage more broadly, I would like to make the point that the time line on which this bill is being moved through is at the government's behest. As such, the creation of this anxiety is a result of the government's decision to push it through so quickly. So I just mirror, echo, those concerns: 33 pages of amendments to a bill that was already 200-odd pages long is very difficult for people in the real world and in my community to get their head around. Thank you.

           <p>
            The amendments I'm moving today relate to strengthening the representation on and transparency over the proposed National Construction Industry Forum. Close to five per cent of the workers in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
             North Sydney
            </a>
            work in building and construction. That's about 4,000 people. I've spoken to many of them and many residential builders who are fearful that the abolition of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB" rel="nofollow">
             AB
            </a>
            CC will drive negative cultural changes in the commercial building sector. Whilst the government claims that carving out the construction industries and its unions divisions from many aspects of the bill will isolate these changes, it is inevitable that what happens at the big end of construction will flow through to the small and medium residential building sector due to the high levels of overlap with subcontractors and workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the course of this rushed debate and harried negotiations we've seen the government release more details around their National Construction Industry Forum. The forum is by no means a replacement for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
             ABCC
            </a>
            , but I am hopeful that all parties to the forum will work together in a respectful, trustful and collaborative manner. As currently constituted, the forum is dominated by ministerial captain's picks from peak bodies and industry groups. My amendments will ensure that those at the table are representative of the whole building industry, not just the big unions or big construction companies. In North Sydney there are around 2,000 construction and building businesses, of which 88 per cent are small businesses. This amendment seeks to ensure that their voice is heard. In order to achieve cultural change throughout the industry from top to bottom, small to medium, residential builders must be at the table. The amendment also ensures that the forum publishes a communique on the departmental website within 14 days of a meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            We've seen here and in the media intense lobbying from the big end of town—those with the power and resources to access the halls of parliament—and in this I count large employer groups and businesses, but also representatives of large unions. Individual employees, small- to medium-sized businesses and workers in low-paid industries, who the government have been wielding in advance to advance their arguments, are largely absent. The fact remains that this is a deal being done largely behind closed doors, and I don't think it's good for our democracy. We must open up the doors and improve the transparency over all processes of government, including statutory bodies like the proposed National Construction Industry Forum. My amendment will ensure that the broader sector and the public can see discussions and decisions of the forum, and I commend the amendment to the House.

             I want to thank the crossbench for the way in which they have engaged, and I particularly thank the member for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
              North Sydney
             </a>
             for this particular amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government will support the amendment. I was listening to the member for North Sydney and, while decisions have not yet been made—we haven't even started to make decisions in terms of the make-up of the forum—I was thinking back over the years about different fora of this nature which I've participated in in different portfolios, and there was always a risk that exactly what the member for North Sydney described could have happened in terms of the biggest players and groups ultimately dominating it and so we wouldn't get that guaranteed representation, particularly by the small to medium residential sector. I think this amendment provides an important brake to make sure that what we're hoping for happens: bringing all the parties together in different ways and doing that effectively.

               <p>
                I move an amendment to government amendment (30):
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">
                 Amendment
                </a>
                (30), item 506B, at the end of subsection 180A(2), add ", or must ensure bargaining representatives have a reasonable opportunity to communicate and reasons for not providing written agreement to employees".
               </p>
               <p>
                The most concerning part about the government amendments is the provision giving unions veto power over enterprise agreements. This means that an unscrupulous individual can hold a business and its workforce to ransom, demanding concessions or private benefits that may not be in the interests of union members or other employees. The minister has argued that bad actors may seek to encourage workers to agree to something that is not in their interests. I accept that there are those bad actors. However, this veto power goes too far. It is unconscionable that any government would seek to provide a veto power of this nature, particularly to its financial backers.
               </p>
               <p>
                My amendment negates the veto power by saying that employers must have written agreement from the union or provide reasonable opportunities for unions to communicate their concerns to employees. I believe that the employees should be well informed about any change to any agreement that comes to them, and I support that the union can provide an important perspective on that. However, it is fundamentally up to individuals to decide whether or not they get to vote on an agreement and whether an agreement is in their interests. If a union thinks it's a dud then let them say so, but let employees decide for themselves what is best for them.

                </p>
                <p>
                 The government won't be supporting this amendment. I think it's worth being mindful that when people talk about a veto on one side of the bargaining table that that same veto is there for the employer. So we have a situation where either the employer or the employee organisation can say, 'This is not yet ready to go to a vote.' I know it's been in the media as though there's only a veto on one side. The veto is also on the employer side. The concept here is you reach agreement before it goes to the vote. We believe that's an important safeguard to avoid a situation where substandard agreements are put out under these provisions.

                  <p>
                   I support the amendment moved by the member Wentworth, which is very reasonable and balanced. I refer to the minister's comments about there being an equal veto on both sides. I would put it that actually the agreement is between the employer and the employee. They are the two parties to the agreement. The only veto by a third party would be the intervention of an employee representative or union. It is not the same thing to say that the employer has a right to veto an agreement between the employer and the employees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This amendment softens the requirements, so the employer can show that a bargaining representative has had a reasonable opportunity to communicate reasons for not providing written agreements to the employees, which seems like a very reasonable compromise because it is reasonably foreseeable that the interests of an employee representative, such as a union, could differ from the interests of an employee of an organisation. This requirement doesn't apply now, and there have been examples of agreements being put to employees and approved, despite the union not wanting it to go to a vote. Unions have played an important role in protecting workers' rights over the centuries, but it makes no sense to actually turn them into a barrier between employees and employers. I support that amendment.

                     These amendments relate to the very extensive sections of this bill that are, in the view of the opposition, entirely objectionable. The Registered Organisations Commission would be abolished by this bill. We are opposed to the abolition of the Registered Organisations Commission because it would effectively shield the government's union paymasters from the scrutiny that they ought to be subject to, as any other organisation in our community ought to be subject to. Registered organisations are afforded special privileges in the industrial relations system. They control assets worth millions of dollars and have a large amount of trust placed in them by their members. The Registered Organisations Commission, together with the Australian Building and Construction Commission, was critical in guarding against union misconduct—

                      <p>
                       Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Registered Organisations Commission together with the Australian Building and Construction Commission did an effective job in guarding against union misconduct and lawlessness in the construction industry.
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">
                        Amendment
                       </a>
                       s (1), (9) and (25) of those that I've moved would remove provisions in the bill which go to the abolition of the Registered Organisations Commission.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The opposition is also completely opposed to the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We oppose this abolition because, effectively, it hands over control of the construction industry to the notoriously militant CFMMEU. The name of that union is a byword for bullying, intimidation, lawlessness, criminal conduct and thuggishness in the construction sector. When Labor last abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission—they have form in this—two-thirds of working days lost to industrial action were in the construction industry. The abolition at that time caused the rate of disputes in the construction sector to increase by 46 per cent at a time when disputes in other sectors declined by 31 per cent. It is not okay, for example, for women in the construction industry to be targeted with sexist slurs and physical threats and that, sadly, is what we have consistently seen with the CFMMEU, and the Australian Building and Construction Commission has been an effective means of protecting against some of the worst of those excesses.

                        Amendments
                       </a>
                       (2) and (10) of those I've circulated would remove the provisions in the bill which abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The opposition is trenchantly opposed to the multi-employer bargaining provisions contained in this bill. They amount to Labor's intent to kill off enterprise bargaining and to replace it with a new centralised wage-fixing system and umpire. Amendments (3) to (8), (11) to (15), (23) to (24), (26) to (28) and (30) would remove all of the provisions in the bill relating to changes in multi-employer bargaining. We are opposed to the bill's expansion of the single interest stream that would allow the Fair Work Commission to authorise workers with common interests to bargain together. Business groups are united in their condemnation of the common interest provision being so broad as to be simply ridiculous. The mere fact of two businesses physically being located together would satisfy the very wide definition of 'common interest.' The

                       </a>
                       , said that this test exposes the Australian economy to sectorwide strike action, disrupting supply chains and key industries at a time of extraordinary global volatility. Amendments (16), (20) and (22) would implement this change.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We're opposed to the compulsion in the legislation of the single interest employer authorisation provisions. Amendments (17) and (19) give effect to our opposition to the government's compulsion provisions. We oppose the way the bill has dealt with the question of public interest; amendment (18) gives effect to our position there. 'Common interest' needs a clear definition; amendment (21) gives effect to that. Amendment (29) would provide for the minister to be required to conduct a review of the operation of the amended provisions of the act after they have operated for 12 months.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This is a truly dreadful bill which will take Australia back to the grim, dark days of the 1970s, with pattern bargaining, repeated strikes and a sluggish and unproductive economy. That is what we face, and our amendments seek to deal with the most egregious elements of this bill.

                         Before I make my remarks, I need to ask a quick question of the mover, simply because I'm not sure if the version that's been circulated is the same as the one's that has been moved. It might have just been speaking notes or a late change, but the reference that was given to what's here as section 30 on the review was described in the speech as section 29. I don't know if that means the version that's circulated is different or if I've got the wrong one. I don't want to—

I don't know if that means he's moving something different, or whether what's been circulated is right and he gave the wrong speech. I think we can work on the basis that this amendment is not ready.

                                I'm sure there are going to be more contributions, particularly from the crossbench—and this debate will continue into the Senate—on how you reasonably define a 'small business', and there is a reasonable conversation to be had there. But this amendment says small business exemptions should be given to anyone with up to 200 employees. 'Up to 200 employees' should be the definition of a small business! They've also attempted to take out altogether the low-paid-stream access to bargaining. So everything that's been said about feminised industries, about child care, about aged care, about getting wages moving in these sectors—they're taking all of that out. They also want to define a small business as 200 employees. On top of that, they're not quite sure what they're moving. We'll be opposing this.

                                  Australia, a 2015 Australian survey of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found many individual and systemic examples of discrimination. For example: '19 per cent of people born with atypical sex characteristics fail to complete secondary school, due to reasons including the impact of medical interventions during puberty, stigmatisation and bullying on grounds of sex characteristics and unaddressed issues associated with developmental delays.'

                                  Good discrimination law focuses on people's attributes rather than just lumping people into one group. For example, our antidiscrimination laws protect people of all sexual orientations not just people who identify as gay. In the same way, this amendment would protect all people with variations of their sex characteristics not just people who identify as intersex. Very relevant is that other Australian jurisdictions already recognise this matter and have acted on it, with Victoria, the

                                  I acknowledge that supporting this amendment could be regarded as problematic by the government because the federal

                                   Sex Discrimination

                                  Act has included the term 'intersex status' since 2013. I also acknowledge that during debate on a Greens' amendment to the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021, that would have replaced the words 'intersex status' with 'sex characteristics', Labor indicated it would not support the amendment because it would cause inconsistency with other legislation such as the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
                                   Sex Discrimination Act

                                  . But two wrongs don't make a right. So the government should either support this amendment and then move quickly to also amend the Sex Discrimination Act and any other relevant antidiscrimination legislation or, at least, make a rock-solid commitment today to soon amend both the secure jobs, better pay bill and the Sex Discrimination Act and any other relevant antidiscrimination legislation.

                                  The substance of this straightforward amendment is inherently important and very meaningful to many people. It's been advocated for many years, certainly as far back as the creation of the Sex Discrimination Act in 2013. So, please, I say to the government: let's do this and do it today.

                                   I'd like to speak specifically to this bill's inclusion of protection from discrimination on the basis of gender identity in the Fair Work Act. I'd like to commend the government for taking these critical steps to protect groups who experience severe levels of workplace discrimination, and I want to thank the member for Clark for moving this amendment to ensure that best-practice language for the intersex community is used in this bill, as the Greens have recommended for years.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Studies have shown that only 22 per cent of gender diverse people feel comfortable to be open about their gender identity with their colleagues. Just over 43 per cent reported being deliberately misgendered within the workplace in the last year, and this bill would go some of the way to ensuring gender diverse people feel safer in the workplace, allowing them to feel more comfortable and secure in themselves.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Protection on the basis of gender identity is a welcomed commitment from the government. Although I welcome their intention in taking steps to protect the intersex community, protection on the basis of intersex status does not go far enough. For intersex people to be fully protected from discrimination, we must protect them against discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics. This is best-practice language and it protects intersex people at all stages of development and widens the scope of protection for intersex people. It's language that Intersex

                                    BURKE (—) (): My response to this amendment is probably quite different to how I've responded to any of the other amendments in that this amendment is actually seeking to do something that I originally requested during the drafting stage of this bill. The explanation that the member for Clark gave of the process and the interaction with the

                                    In the first instance, I want to make clear: the government makes no argument of principle in any way against any of the two contributions that were just made by the member for Clark and the member for Brisbane. In the second instance, the intention to get best-practice language here so that people are properly covered is a commitment that is shared by those who've spoken with the government.

                                    I raised the issue personally with the Attorney-General, because it was the Attorney-General's Department that had raised it with my department. The intention was made clear to me then, by the Attorney-General, that the government does intend to bring in legislation that will deal with this issue across all relevant legislation at once. Being able to do that avoids any problems with the different parts of legislation not interacting properly.

                                    It's a strange one in terms of saying that we won't support the amendment but it's on the basis that we accept completely the arguments that have been put, and want to be able to bring forward government legislation that addresses it consistently across all relevant acts.

                                      (2)calls on the Government to change the definition of a small business from 15 to 100 employees".

                                      The purpose of this amendment is to amend section 23 of the Fair Work Act with the effect of changing the definition of a small business. Currently, section 23 defines a small business as a business comprising of 15 employees or less. Casuals are not included in this count unless there is a systematic or regular nature to their employment. For most businesses this would mean most, if not all, of their casual the employees would be included in the employee count for the purposes of defining a small business.

                                      My amendment seeks to change the number of employees that define a small business from 15 to 100. The rationale for this change is simple. Businesses with fewer than 100 staff do not have the human resources departments, they do not have the pay roster, they simply do not have capacity to expend resources—financial and human—to negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements that this bill will potentially force upon them. Without this change we are relegating the thousands of mum-and-dad businesses and entrepreneurial enterprises to an immediate future of costly union-led negotiations. These businesses, many of which are still trying to recover from COVID-19, cannot afford the time or the financial resources.

                                      What we're looking at here is staff with a threshold of 15. Now, let me tell you: right across Australia, this is going to capture fruit-and-vegetable stores; this is going to capture independent service stations; this is going to capture independent and small supermarkets, IGAs. This bill is, I think, unwittingly pitting mum-and-dad operators against unions.

                                      What's going to happen to those businesses that have 15 or 16 staff, or perhaps even up to 20, is they're going to contract their staffing numbers to make sure that they have fewer than 15. That's going to mean job losses for those 15-year-olds and 16-year-olds that are working at the fruit and veg store every Sunday because on Saturday they're playing sport. This bill is really concerning, so I'm trying to remedy it in some way to take small business out of it. This government is setting up small business for a

                                       I want to thank the member for Mayo for bringing this issue forward. A number of members of the crossbench here and in the other place have been raising different ways of dealing with the small business exemption. Some have raised it through a shift from headcount to full-time equivalents. Some have raised it as a change in the numbers. I'll be up-front here: the government's preference is to keep it at a headcount of 15, which is where we've got it. I respect that, in the passage of both houses, there'll be different negotiations that'll happen on that. I appreciate that, particularly for a number of the crossbenchers, a shift on this area is an absolutely critical issue, and that's been conveyed to me. I also acknowledge that, for a large number, there are other issues in the bill that they passionately support. But this is something where they need to stand up for their electorates. I simply want to acknowledge that but make clear that the government will be opposing the amendments that seek to change where the small business exemption is, with an understanding that the debate on this will probably continue as it goes through the other place.

                                        I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this amendment. We are extremely concerned about the impact on small businesses of this set of radical industrial relations changes. Indeed, in our own set of amendments we proposed for that reason that the threshold be set at 200 full-time equivalent employees. The minister laughed at that; he thought that was funny. We don't think it's funny that small businesses are facing the threat of getting dragged into extensive and onerous negotiation processes so that they are going to have to devote their time—the time of the owner who is also the chief information officer, also the chief financial officer, also the head of human resources, also the general counsel—to all of these functions for which large businesses have a team of specialists, and certainly industrial relations or workplace relations is one of those areas. In small business the entrepreneur who set up that business and is creating employment faces that burden on a daily basis because they have to do all of these other things. Around Australia there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of small businesses that now face the prospect of having to deal with the unions and the Fair Work Commission as compulsory participants in their business.

The mindset from those opposite is that every enterprise of any size has unlimited funds, unlimited resources, and all they need to do is get in there with a bit of persuasion from the

                                        —'We've come around with our baseball bats to make you see reason.' They want to shake down businesses of all kinds. As far as they're concerned, businesses are endlessly profitable. Small businesses are run by proprietors who are working long hours, often working through the weekend, to give their employees opportunities.

                                        There are so many stories of small business proprietors who, when times are tough, make sure that their employees get paid and continue to have a job, while the employer, the small business, might take an increase to their mortgage, might get extra finance to keep the business going. The member for Mallee brought together small businesses from her electorate just yesterday. I talked to a chocolate manufacturer who told me about the great work she's done building a business and how satisfying it is to be able to employ young people in her country town and give them employment opportunities.

                                        Business owners like that around the country are facing significant threat and risk as a consequence of this intrusive legislation which is going to greatly expand the role of unions and bring them uninvited into small businesses around the country. This is a disastrously retrograde step. I absolutely endorse the observations of the member for Mayo about the perverse incentives that this now creates for small businesses to seek to shrink down below a threshold, leading to employment being lost—quite the opposite of the baseless claims that have been made by the government about the consequence of this legislation. So, the opposition will be supporting the amendment proposed by the member for Mayo.

They work till six o'clock at night, so they're coming in and out of our hardware store till six o'clock at night.' She said: 'I race home to get the meals for everyone, and then I do the books for the business. My husband's a builder, so I do his books and the hardware store books, and I'm up till well after midnight. The tradies want to get on the job at six o'clock the next morning, so I have to get up at half past five.' And she said, at the thought of doing another hour or two hours of work: 'I just burst out crying. I just couldn't stop.'

                                         I mean, you don't understand that. You people on that side of the House simply do not understand that. The introduction of that GST did exactly what they are accusing you people of doing here—exactly the same thing. But there really isn't a feeling for small business. Woolworths and Coles are allowed to go into newsagencies, they're allowed to go into butcher shops, they're allowed to go into every single area of the economy and wipe out small business right across the board—15 inquiries into them, all a joke; you just rubber-stamp them. So, we don't want any more hypocrisy. But I strongly support not only my colleague here but all the other colleagues on the crossbench, who are all moving exactly the same sorts of resolutions. Please excuse us all for repetitiveness, but we're not a party, so each one of us does our own thing. But each one of us has come to the conclusion that small business has got to be excluded, and it's not excluded here in this legislation.

                                           2022 here in the House. As a first-term MP, it's great to see that the debate is robust and that it's done in a safe and respectful manner in the 47th Parliament—so far!
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Let me be clear: I'm not opposed to wage increases for hardworking Australians. As a matter of fact, many in my electorate of Fowler who work in child care, teaching, nursing and low-paid jobs will benefit tremendously. They need this, as we're facing a cost-of-living crisis. However, any wage increase must be done fairly, equitably and in a way that does not have unintended consequences for lower-socioeconomic communities and for multicultural communities that are built on small, family-run business. In my Fowler electorate, there are currently over 18,000 trading small businesses, with the majority owned and managed by migrants and refugees. In fact, one in three small businesses are run by migrants and refugees, who are the most entrepreneurial of all small business owners and who are most likely to start their own business.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           What plans are in place to communicate the IR changes and reforms to the non-English-speaking communities? My amendments seek to ensure that the Fair Work Commission takes into consideration the need to provide guidelines and community outreach programs in other languages, to support our culturally diverse communities in order to run their businesses. Are we going to have to face another situation like the Western Sydney COVID lockdowns, when no-one in Fowler was given access to information in the appropriate language until it was too late?
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Let me remind the House again that my electorate of Fowler has one of the lowest median income rates in the country. The median wage of people in my electorate is 20 per cent less than the national average. When it comes to reforms like this one, we have often been ignored, neglected and forgotten. If we are to be a truly inclusive and diverse society, we need to ensure that reforms like this are meaningful to the 52 per cent of my electorate who are born overseas.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           I cannot stand by while my diverse and multicultural community is ignored yet again. We must create a pathway that clears confusion and prevents language barriers from misleading people on any political reforms. I don't need to remind the people in this House that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           My community was built on the shoulders of migrants and refugees who came to this country seeking better opportunities for themselves and their families. We have more than 130 nationalities, with many of these people running some type of business—from a banh mi bakery to a pho noodle restaurant or a pearl milk tea store. They're hardworking small-business owners. However, as it currently stands, small business is defined as having 15 employees—including casuals—under the Fair Work Act. That means if my local Vietnamese pho restaurant employs 16 people, they could be forced to enter multi-employer bargaining situations when they lack the time, resources and funds to do so.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           We should resolve this issue by amending the definition of a 'small business'. Instead of capping the total at 15 people, I would propose that any business that employs less than 20 full-time employees is a small business. But first and foremost, we must address the issue of interpretation, language translation and community outreach within diverse communities. It's true that Australia is one, and it is many. We are a country of many people, many languages and many backgrounds. Acknowledging this is critical to any further discussions on the bill.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           I, like many of my crossbench colleagues, have raised that a bill this complex requires more consultation, more time and more collaboration. Once again, while I acknowledge the government wants to keep its election promise to deliver wage increases by the end of the year—there's about six weeks to go—then they should push the most agreeable part of the bill through first and give us the opportunity to consult with our local businesses in respect of the multi-employer bargaining section of the bill. I think that's only fair. We are, after all, a fair, democratic country. Thank you.

                                            I thank the member for Fowler for the amendment. In particular, I thank the member for Fowler for confining the amendment itself to the issues about community languages. I respect, in the speech that was given, there are other issues the member for Fowler's deeply concerned about, including the small-business exemption and how that's defined, but I do appreciate the amendment has been put in a form that allows the government to be able to support it.

                                            have about 30 languages where they are doing this. The Fair Work Commission operates more through an interpreter service as to how they deal with community languages at the moment. But as we both know, because our communities are not that different, and I'm pleased the member for Fowler referred to the lockdown period of the pandemic, there was a period where information was not being provided in community languages when it needed to be. So this puts into the Fair Work Act a requirement as to what's expected, and the government's very happy to back that. The government thanks the member for Fowler for bringing it forward.

My amendments will not interfere with wage rises for low-wage workers, affect gender equality, or impose unnecessary barriers to making agreements These are laudable aims and I support them 100 per cent. My amendments, however, will make this bill more workable for businesses, particularly small businesses, who have had an incredibly tough time in recent years. It will make it more workable for workers, who desperately need a pay rise to cope with the rising cost of living.

No business group in the country supports compulsory engagement in multi-party bargaining. No business group in the country supports this, not even COSBOA, which was the first business group to consider the value of multi-party bargaining—never under any circumstances did they say this should this be compulsory for business. When we are heading into tumultuous economic times, it is absolutely reckless to ignore the legitimate concerns of business. It is reckless to ignore the

Will these changes actually increase wages when agreements are made that may stop a business from changing their business model to meet the needs of their time? We just don't know. The truth is, we do not know the full implications of this legislation, and businesses in my electorate don't even realise that they're going to be subject to it. If the government will not take the time to properly consult on this bill, and properly work with business to come up with solutions that will work for business and workers to drive productivity and wage growth, then we need to make this change.

These businesses should not be treated as if they were. I'm seeking an amendment that would raise the threshold of businesses to 100 full-time equivalent staff. Businesses below this level don't have

                                              I acknowledge that the government has shifted on a grace period for six months, but that is not long enough for business. We should extend that period to 12 months and a more realistic time frame for negotiations to be concluded. I support the government's desire to increase workplace flexibility. However, I believe that we should always move to conciliation before we go to arbitration, and so I seek that we require conciliation before subjecting parties to arbitration and the very significant cost that it entails. In intractable disputes, my amendments would help prevent gaming or other mischief. They simply require the minister to define 'intractable', require the parties to engage in good faith, and require Fair Work Commission to be satisfied that the position of each party is fair and reasonable before arbitration commences.

                                              Finally—and I think this is crucial—my amendments require an independent review of the bill after 12 months. Sally

                                              made the point to me the other day that parliament tends to ignore industrial relations once a significant reform has been made, and so we miss the opportunity to refine legislation after commencement. That is a mistake, but one that we can rectify by ensuring a review of these changes is taken in due course.

                                              The government is determined to pass this bill in a month. It is a huge risk. It is a national experiment in changing workplace relations at a time when our economy is fragile. Wage growth is too low and has been too low for too long. I want to see higher wages, but I don't want to see small business closing or unemployment rising, and I really don't want to see a wage-price spiral where higher wages are eaten up by rolling economywide price hikes. That would be the worst possible outcome. The government should do the responsible thing and limit the scope of the experiment. Order. We should not risk that today.

                                              <p>
                                               I thank the member for Wentworth both for bringing these issues forward to the House and also for the conversations that we've had, back and forth, leading up to the debate this morning.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               First of all, I'll just go through a couple of the issues, if I may. The advice that we've been given is that in the structure of the act the arbitration clauses that are already there do presume conciliation before arbitration, and that has been the practice of the commission. So, in terms of the intention that's being sought with the amendment and the importance of conciliation being provided first, that is something that the government shares. It's been how the Fair Work Act has operated, and it is our expectation that it would continue to do so.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               I want to explain the difference in view when it comes to whether, from the employer perspective, it should be opt-in only. It's very much a different policy view, which is appropriately ventilated here. If you start with single enterprise bargaining, the concept there—while it's rarely used—is that bargaining can be initiated by either side of the bargaining table. It can be initiated by the employer or it can be initiated by the workforce. If initiated by the workforce, it's called a majority support determination. They very rarely get up, but sometimes they do. The principle behind it is to say that we're trying to have a bargain of equals. That's what we're trying to have; we're trying to have a sensible conversation between the employer and the employees, and either side of that conversation can initiate it.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               That's the same principle that we want to bring to multi-employer bargaining. One of the reasons that I brought forward the government amendment that was carried earlier with the voting provision change was to make sure that we did not end up with a situation where, at any individual workplace, neither the employer nor the workforce had voted in favour of being part of it. We are wanting to keep to that principle that is currently there in single enterprise bargaining. That is, quite simply, that either side of the negotiation can initiate it. To have a situation where it's opt-in only—the cooperative stream is opt-in only; there is one stream that is designed specifically for that purpose—but to not have a mechanism where the workforce can initiate a negotiation, but the employer can, takes away from the concept of what we're trying to get here. The strength of agreements is that they end up being able to deliver both the wage rises and the flexibility or productivity improvements because you've had a negotiation where both sides had a level of power in that conversation. It's for that reason that we want to maintain the majority support determination principle and it being possible for a workforce to say, 'We want to be part of this.'
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Finally, with respect to the independent review, it gives me a chance to say publicly what I have said privately to the member for Wentworth and to many on the crossbench: I do believe the act should have an independent review, and I'm supportive of there being an independent review. What I don't want to do is have a situation where we adopt an independent review in good faith in this place and then go to the Senate and in Senate negotiations we end up with a different independent review, which would then look like bad faith in terms of what had been discussed here. I am very happy, as a result of it having been raised, to commit the government to the fact that there will be an independent review. The exact timing—whether it's a longer one with a halfway point of reporting, or exactly how it works—is something I would rather do in a single negotiation when it gets to the other place. I suspect the relationships between the crossbench here and the crossbench there mean that we should be able to get to a sensible position.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               So the government will be opposing the amendment, for the reasons I explained about the opt-in principle, but I thought it was important just to make clear our view of the conciliation provisions and also the undertaking on an independent review.

                                                        The unintended consequences of this legislation could have incredibly negative impacts on small businesses in my electorate, and they are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. It is misleading to the Australian public to claim that this will get wages moving, when there are going to be months of delay and negotiation—complex processes—and the winners will be the unions and the lawyers; it will not be the workers. It is disingenuous of the government to claim that this legislation will assist feminised industries, when many small businesses are run by women. They will be the first to suffer when this legislation brings an absolute stalemate to sectors like child care.

                                                        In Warringah, there are at least 370 businesses that would be able to engage in or be compelled to engage in multi-employer bargaining under the current definition of a 'small business', having less than 15 employees. The added complexity of being compelled to engage in the multi-employer bargaining process will put fear into many business owners. They are struggling to keep their heads above water, still reeling from the impacts of COVID-19 and increasing inflation.

They haven't even been part of the negotiations, and the bill currently allows an employee representative—the union—to join an employer to a multiparty
                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBA" rel="nofollow">

                                                          after the conclusion of the agreement. The Fair Work Commission should consider the potential impact on the productivity of a business as a result of being compelled to sign onto the EBA. This is a straightforward amendment that should not be objected to by the government.
                                                         </p>

                                                          The public interest test is amendment (6). Again, the amendment deals with the potential effects on productivity and competition. The bill as currently drafted requires the Fair Work Commission to be satisfied that it is not contrary to the public interest to do so before making a single-interest authorisation. The problem is that the drafting does not specify what would be contrary to the public interest. There is, therefore, no guarantee that the Fair Work Commission would take into account the benefits to productivity, competition and consumer protection that come from enterprise-level collective bargaining. The proposed amendment would require the Fair Work Commission to take into account the need to achieve productivity and fairness through an emphasis on enterprise-level collective bargaining and the need to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and the provision of consumer protections.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Amendment (5) deals with common interest. In the single-interest stream, the common interest test in the current bill is very loosely defined and could have the effect of lessening competition by obliging smaller competitors to agree to multi-employer agreements with much larger businesses, with the potential for the smaller competitors to simply be priced out of the market. My proposed amendments would oblige the Fair Work Commission to take into account the economic circumstances and the relative sizes and scope of the employers' enterprises, as well as the extent to which the employers operate collaboratively rather than competitively, when determining whether the employers have a common interest.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Of course, we've heard much today of the small business definition. The bill currently exempts businesses with fewer than 15 employees from being forced into single-interest employer bargaining. That figure is ridiculous. Many businesses with up to 50 employees would be unable to compete with large businesses who could afford to absorb the extra cost. They will go to the wall. What the amendment proposes is that it be at 50 full-time equivalent. At the very least, the government is saying it will consider it, and there is dispute on this number.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Everyone in this place goes to their communities saying they support small business, yet here we are with legislation that will make it incredibly difficult for small business owners. I think this is really problematic. It does not have social licence.

                                                           I thank the member for Warringah for the issues that have been raised. Some of them go to issues that were raised in other amendments, so I won't go into that in a lot of detail now, but I've given the reasons in terms of the definition of a 'small business'. The government is not seeking to have amendments on that during this debate today.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           There are three issues that were raised by the member for Warringah and I want to go through them and explain why the government will oppose the amendment. First of all, the issue about someone being joined to an existing agreement simply by virtue of a decision of a union is not how it operates. It could only happen with there then being a vote of the workforce. Once again, going to that situation I was describing before, things have to be initiated either by a majority of the workforce or by the employer. Either can make the decision on opting in to the processes here.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           In terms of productivity, I have no in-principle objection to what the member has said, but I would say that productivity already has to be considered. Productivity is specifically in the objects of the act. Productivity is also then brought in again when we deal with the objects of the bargaining section of the act. Therefore, in applying the public interest test and in making any decisions here, the Fair Work Commission is expected to be taking account of productivity. There's a reason why we have tried to keep some of these tests general and to fall back on the objects of the different parts of the act, rather than have a new list of extra conditions. The reason is that, 10 years ago or a bit more than that, this House in good faith established a low-paid bargaining stream with a whole lot of extra conditions that came out of this sort of debate. The result, when it came to practical application, was that we ended up with a stream which everybody had accepted should exist and everyone accepted should be a pathway for multi-employer bargaining for people on low wages, but which, effectively, no-one was able to access, to the point where people stopped applying.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           So the view on the productivity proposal that's there is not that it shouldn't be taken into account but that the government's view is that it is already taken into account and we don't want to make the same mistakes that were made with the low-paid stream and end up putting so many conditions in place that we end up with a stream that of itself becomes overly complex and unusable. If, out of this, we end up establishing something that the very people we have been talking about are unable to access, then the problem that we're seeking to address won't have been addressed.

They go to many of the issues in this bill that we have indicated that we're very concerned about, including the definition of 'small business' or the cut-off point at which these intrusive and disruptive provisions can be visited upon a small business. Many of them have no idea this is coming. In terms of mandatory multi-employer bargaining and the other issues that we have raised that we've got very grave concerns about, we sought to address those in our amendments. A number of those issues are also sought to be addressed in the amendments moved by the member for Warringah, and the opposition will be supporting those amendments.

                                                             I'd like to speak briefly on the topic of businesses having to opt in to a bargain that has already been agreed to. The minister has rightly outlined that, if workers want to bargain, they should be able to bargain, and I wholeheartedly agree with that. But a business should also be able to bargain. If they're going to be pushed into an agreement and they have not had a chance to bargain, that could be extremely detrimental to their business and extremely detrimental to the workers involved as well, in the long term.

                                                              I rise in support for the member's of Warringah's amendment and to note that, in this House, we now have several proposals for the definition of 'small business'—everything from 200 to 100 to 50. There is a reflected concern, I think, across this House around how this legislation will affect small businesses. I know that I've had these discussions with the minister. I rise simply to have it recorded that, whatever number the government ends up landing on, the concern is broad. I think the concern is multipartisan and that there are concerns among businesses across electorates and across Australia that, potentially, they will be unintentionally drawn in under this legislation.
                                                             </p>

                                                              In Goldstein, an electorate that has something like 17,000 small businesses, from small manufacturers to small cafes and such, those with a 15 headcount who would have casuals, 15-year-olds, working in their cafes, in the hospitality businesses, could potentially be drawn in to mandatory multi-employer bargaining under this legislation. I understand that there's an argument for small businesses of a particular size to be able to bargain collectively. I think the line in the legislation as it stands at a 15 headcount is wrong, and I rise again to just really press home the point to the government that when this legislation go to the Senate this is something that really deserves due consideration. Thank you.

There are many elements of the amendments put forward by the member for Warringah and indeed by the member for Wentworth that I agree with. I have some disagreements on other elements, but the issue around the size of small business is I think a universal concern amongst virtually everyone I have spoken to—or have had the opportunity to speak to, in the very short period of time we've had to consider the Fair Work

But we do. We know what is coming. I am gravely concerned about the impact this is going to have on small businesses. They're already facing significant increases in interest rates and energy prices, and we know all of that. But this is going to drastically impact on the ability of mum-and-dad small businesses to do business. The government can't seriously suggest that cut-off. The cut-off cannot be 15; it just can't be. That headcount is so unrealistic. A small business, say a cafe, will be employing casuals, part-timers and full-timers. Even just a small cafe would be over the threshold and they'd be covered by this legislation, the Fair Work

They're not accountants. I'm really very concerned about this, and I know most of my colleagues here are, too.

I implore the Leader of the House: these guys, our small businesses, are really going to be doing it very, very tough, particularly after Christmas. More than likely we'll end up seeing a couple more interest rate rises. And I know already, from the businesses that are talking to me, about how tough they are finding it. These changes are going to significantly impact upon not just their ability to trade but also their mental health. Already small businesses feel like unpaid tax collectors and that they are doing so many jobs that government used to do. They are under the pump, and that is only going to get worse, and it's going to get significantly worse after Christmas. I implore the Leader of the House to re-examine this issue. It doesn't need to go back to the Senate. You've already made 150 amendments. You could bring another amendment today. We are literally building the plane as it's going down the runway. When I was a builder we used to have a saying and that is: measure twice, cut once. We're changing things—I know this is a complex area of law. We've got to get this right, and we are a long, long way from getting this right.

                                                                I would also encourage the Leader of the House—you've heard some really sensible submissions from the crossbench. One thing is very clear and that is that this bill is being rushed through. If you rush this you're going to make mistakes. To fundamentally change the way that we are doing business from an industrial relations perspective—it is too important to rush this, because when you rush things there are always unintended consequences. So my plea to you, the Leader of the House, is just hit pause. Let's consult a bit more broadly on this.

                                                                So many industry bodies are up in arms about this. What I'm concerned about are the mum and dad punters, the small businesses—quite frankly, I don't think most of them even know what's coming. They're not glued to the television and the papers like we are. They're too busy trying to make a living. If this bill gets passed then they are going to suffer very, very badly—

I worked in small business, at Yarra Valley Snack Foods, and I joined the company when we were at seven employees. Seven years later I left that company when we were at 130 employees. So as a leader in that business I lived through the change of a business. I can guarantee you that at 130 employees we were still very much a small business, because we had a lot of people on the books, but we had a lot of expenses. We didn't have a large

Getting the number right on this is so crucial, because it has unintended consequences. As the member for Fisher said, 'Measure twice and cut once.' I worked on a job site at university. I made the mistake of measuring once and it was a mistake I never made again!

They're ideological discussions, yes, but they have consequences in the real world for real people—for small-business owners, for mothers and fathers who are looking to put food on the table—so it's so important that we take the time to get this legislation right. We're already at 150 amendments.
                                                                   </p>

Tony Smith from yesterday that relates directly to this amendment, to this debate and to what's happening in rushing this legislation through. He said:
                                                                   </p>

We need to take our time to get it right and to allow a committee to understand it. Having 150 amendments already shows that there are changes that need to be made during this debate. Every time we make another amendment, it has unintended consequences. When you work in business, you take your time to get important decisions right. This is a crucial decision that we are making in this House. I urge us to take the time to get it right.

                                                                     <p>
                                                                      I rise to also support this amendment. In talking on supporting this amendment, I'd first like to point out that the government has shown that it has been willing to listen and to make amendments to this bill. As a matter of fact, it's been prepared to do so at such a rate that it is proving to be highly embarrassing for the government. I can't remember a piece of legislation in recent memory where there have been 150 amendments, and we're beginning to count. I'm glad the minister's here because the number of amendments—150—shows that he hasn't done his work, he hasn't done his job. He hasn't consulted, and one of the areas he clearly hasn't consulted on is the number of employees that constitute a small business. As the minister should know, there is a wide variety of regulations and rules around what constitutes a small business.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      This legislation will have an enormous impact on small business because it will see unions for the first time be able to walk in the front doors of small businesses. This law makes sure that they have taken the smallest and the narrowest definition possible for small business. As previous speakers have mentioned, this comes at a time when small businesses are facing pressures, the likes of which they haven't seen for decades. They're seeing rising electricity and gas prices. They're seeing rising regulatory burdens being placed upon them. And now they're going to confront this new workforce legislation and multi-employer bargaining, which hasn't been properly defined. Small businesses have no idea what multi-employer bargaining will mean for them and their staff. So I say to the government: this legislation has been embarrassing enough for you. Now is the time for you to go back and, in particular, liaise and discuss with all the relevant employer organisations about what should constitute the definition of a small business, what the size of a small business should be. It's clear that right across this House we're saying, 'You've got it wrong.' Like you have with the other 150 amendments that you've had to make where you've admitted you've got it wrong, you've got this wrong as well. So I say to the minister: enough's enough. Enough errors in this bill. Enough harm. Enough damage. You're already doing enough. Let's not go even further.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      When it comes to the size of a small business, you should be looking at the number of regulations or amendments you've put in place—150—and, at a minimum, defining a small business as someone with 150 employees. Here, we're suggesting a lesser number than that but one which would mean that the damage this bill will do to small business will not impact on real small businesses. I say to the minister: enough's enough. It's time to admit that this legislation goes too far. It's time to admit that the damage this will do to small business, especially in the limited definition of 'small business' and the number of employees that a small business has, needs to change.
                                                                     </p>

Understand the impact, the regulatory burden and the uncertainty that you will be placing on small business if you go forward with this. The House is sending you a clear message, Minister: you've got this wrong. You've admitted 150 times already, through making amendments, that you've got it wrong. Let's make it 151 and do the right thing by small business.

I think it's important the House has time to deal with those. On that basis, I'll take the advice of the previous member, the member for Wannon, where he said that on this particular issue enough is enough, and I'd require that the question be put.

I agree wholeheartedly that the people of Australia did give a mandate for wage growth, especially in the long-undervalued and largely feminised care sectors. And I wholeheartedly agree with the need for urgent reforms to ensure that there is equal pay for equal work. However, I too have been given a mandate, by the people of Mackellar, to listen to them and to represent them on issues that matter to them and to make a difference to their lives. This includes a strong mandate to support the small-business owners in Mackellar. Small business is the backbone of the Mackellar electorate, with over 35,000 small businesses located there. The results of our recent survey of businesses showed that 84 per cent identified red tape and compliance as their top issue of concern.
                                                                        </p>

In fact, almost nine per cent—8½ thousand people—working in Mackellar work in the building and construction sector. This includes 3,500 businesses, of which 91 per cent are small businesses. This is comparatively high even compared with similar electorates in my area of Sydney.

As with many of my crossbench colleagues, I too have serious concerns at the consequences this legislation will have on small business. So I have moved these amendments to protect small businesses and to reduce the risk that they will be impacted unnecessarily. I do this by removing the uncertainty associated with the common-interest test and raising the bar in regard to the public interest test. Importantly, I seek to remove part 3, the abolishment of the

I also seek to protect small business by updating and clarifying the common-interest test and also flipping the public interest test to be defined as 'in the public interest', not merely 'contrary to the public interest'. Finally, I move to amend the definition of the small business exemption to be based on 15 full-time-equivalent employees, not merely employees under the current definition of small business.

I can completely respect why the issue is being raised through this amendment.

The issue is whether or not we ought to have detailed criteria for the common interest test. In particular, the issue is often raised—and it's part of the amendment—as to whether we should include a concept that businesses must be operating collaboratively, not competitively, because it's here that there is a policy decision that the government is taking quite deliberately and I want to be able to explain it. There are circumstances where businesses are in competition where we do want multi-employer bargaining to apply, and that is different to how the single interest stream or common interest stream runs at the moment.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>
                                                                          I'll give a simple example. When the race to the bottom on wages is, effectively, the nature of the competition, that's not a form of competition that we want to encourage, even though those businesses might be operating competitively. The simplest example I can give would be the example of cleaning companies. It has been the case that a good enterprise agreement is negotiated with a good employer. They get their rates of pay for their workforce improved on the award, and they get some flexibility in return. Then they simply get undercut only on wages—not on quality of service or anything else. As a result, they lose their contract and we end up back where we started. The people who had better wages don't have a job, and the same work is being done with similar equipment in a similar way, and we failed to get wages off the floor of the award.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>

But there are circumstances where the nature of the competition is a race to the bottom on wages, and that is one of the things we want to directly address.
                                                                         </p>

I thank the member for Mackellar not only for bringing the issue forward but also for giving me the opportunity to provide that further explanation to the House.

I want to take up a statement that the minister made then about wanting to create a level playing field for businesses that are in competition. My concern is that the flipside could also be true. Sometimes businesses do compete on wages and they are competing for talent by offering better wages. The concern is that the unintended consequence here is that it actually prevents that sort of competition if one competitor can be dragged into a bargain with its competitor and is no longer able to compete by offering better terms and conditions to those employees. That is the sort of unintended consequence that I am concerned about and that my electorate is concerned about that requires greater consideration of the issues and of what might come out of the legislation, as evidenced by the numerous amendments that have been put by the government and other sides that shows that, really, we need to take some time to think about this. I'd just put that to the minister.

Many businesses out there now, particularly at a time of labour shortage, are paying above agreement or award rates. The capacity to do that is unaffected, whether employees are on an award, on an enterprise agreement or on a multi-employer agreement.

In turn, this caused the rate of disputes in the construction sector to increase by 46 per cent, compared with a 31 per cent decline across all other industries. The regrettable fact is that, thanks to the extraordinary amount of working days lost due to industrial action at building sites, necessary infrastructure for our communities, like schools and hospitals, cost taxpayers up to 30 per cent more—because of the disgraceful conduct of the CFMEU.

In recent years, what decisions have the courts made as to the conduct of the CFMEU? The CFMEU has been found guilty by the courts of breaching industrial law on projects across Australia: offices, apartments, shopping centres, hospitals, children's hospitals, universities, schools, roads, airports, stadiums, hotels, medical research facilities, social housing and many other important community facilities. The CFMEU doesn't care. They play their games on all of these sites and others. The record of experience is clear: the Australian Building and Construction Commission has been an effective check on the excesses and the militancy of the CFMEU and on the damage that they do across the economy.

That is a key reason why we're supporting the amendments moved by the member for Mackellar. Of course, we've also seen that the CFMEU has a disgraceful track record of targeting women on construction sites with sexist slurs and physical threats.
                                                                            </p>

That was the fundamental policy purpose of the previous coalition government in establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It worked effectively to reduce disputation on construction sites around the country.
                                                                            </p>

It employs a large percentage of Australians—many small businesses, many subcontractors. The removal of the ABCC is very, very bad news for the sector and those who work in it. It's very, very bad news for our broader economy, and that is why the opposition itself moved an amendment to remove these provisions. That was unsuccessful. For the same reason, we are certainly pleased to be supporting the amendments moved by the member for Mackellar, because the removal of the ABCC is a very bad step indeed.

                                                                             <p>
                                                                              I support the amendments of the member for Mackellar. Firstly to the point the minister raised about businesses, that the agreement will not be a ceiling on wages but will be a floor, I take the point that it won't be a ceiling. However, if you are bringing businesses together to talk about wages and getting agreement on wages, it would not be a surprise if businesses, having built those relationships and bargaining around wages, come together and decide what they will do about wages and seek it to be an effective ceiling. I think it would be very hard to understand what is actually going on, because of the nature of these businesses.
                                                                             </p>
                                                                             <p>
                                                                              The second piece I'd like to rise in support of is in public interest. In the bill currently you can only have a forced multi-employer agreement if it's not contrary to public interest. I support the member for Mackellar's motion to flip that, that a multi-employer bargain—where the business doesn't choose to enter the bargaining; the employees choose to enter the bargaining—has to be shown to be in the public interest. I see that there's real value in that, because there is deep uncertainty out there amongst the business community about who is going to be drawn into multi-employer bargaining and what sort of bargains and groups of businesses might be drawn in. I think if you flip this and make it that it has to be positively in the public interest you would deal with issues that the minister has rightly raised, where there's a concern about a race the bottom on wages. I can see that there would be strong arguments that the race to the bottom on wages is not in the public interest. Therefore, that would give that protection to that group of workers, but would stop the legitimate fear of many businesses who would say, 'I'm going to be dragged into an agreement which is not in the public interest—and is certainly not in my interests—and is going to take a significant amount of time for me to negotiate. And it won't support the growth and development of my business.' So I recommend the member for Mackellar's amendments to the House.

One in 10 jobs are in this sector, so we are talking about an enormous percentage of Australians and the economy. When you break that number—of who is employed in the sector—down they are often also small business people. We've heard discussion about small business in other amendments that've been put, and I won't speak to that.
                                                                              </p>

If anyone needs their leaky roof fixed he's pretty good! When I meet him on a building site, or talk to tradesmen that have worked for him or others in the sector, something pops out that is quite concerning: there is a different standard of living if you are in a union protected job or if you're not. You notice it in the wages, in the quality of the house that you have and in the sort of work that you get. There are insiders and there are outsiders, and the insiders have your ear; the outsiders don't. They don't get considered.
                                                                              </p>

At some stage we will have a report tabled in this house and we'll have an important, momentous occasion in this parliament and in our democracy and the debate will happen. But when we look at the difference between insiders and outsiders, we see that the insiders get a special place where they get special carve-outs. We had the Prime Minister on Monday say that the reason for that is that we do not want the duplication of regimes.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               Well, we see in this particular example a regime that is effective and is doing a good job getting cut away. So I rise in support of the amendment. There shouldn't be insiders and outsiders. We will always be listening to all voices, including those in small business who work in the construction sector.

I think it was extremely relevant.

In places like Townsville, we saw the construction of our stadium, the Queensland Country Bank Stadium, where the ABCC was involved in calling out extreme, militant behaviour that was conducted by the CFMMEU. These CFMMEU members were not from the region. They were not from Townsville. These union members were flown in—some from interstate and some from the south-east corner. They rocked up and they were bullying people in the construction industry, demanding that they either join the union or get off site. The ABCC stood up for these workers. Many of these workers are small businesses that just want to get on with doing the job.
                                                                                </p>

One independent economic report on the state of the sector said that, during the period, multifaceted productivity rose by 16 per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and there was significant reduction in working days lost through industrial action. This should be supported—having minimal time off and ensuring that the ABCC is there to be the watchdog, the independent umpire and an independent group that can call out bad behaviour

This isn't a good thing. We've seen assaults. We've seen the way that people have been treated on job sites by the CFMMEU in particular, so having an independent watchdog is a good idea.

When there is no watchdog, industrial laws and penalties in this industry are seen as no more serious than a parking ticket. You speed; you pay the fine—and the offending conduct is repeated again and again. We've seen this raised in the courts recently.
                                                                                   </p>

We haven't seen this in the past when we've seen militant unions break the law; they laugh in the face of it and make comments through their social media about it.

After getting rid of the ABCC, the rate of disputes in the construction industry rose to approximately four times the all-industry average. In the first quarter after binning the ABCC in September 2012, the rate of industrial disputes increased fivefold.

My own son worked at Mount Leyshon where 23 human beings ceased to exist in the space of five seconds. One in 30 of the people who worked in the cane fields died in the cane fields. One in 30 people who worked in the mines died in the mines. So don't take lightly the importance of trade unionism. My family—I make no apologies—is a very rich and powerful family, but they could see clearly, as I think all decent people saw clearly, the necessity for some protection and power for the employee class.

To give you some idea, the banana industry employs about 6,000 people. I'm in the pub drinking and I say, 'What do you do, Mick?' He said, 'I work in bananas. ' I said, 'Well, you're not working today.' He said, 'I don't work on Tuesdays.' I said, 'Do you work later in the week?' He said: '

If you turn up at 6.30 in the morning at the corner of Eden Street, a bus picks you up and takes you out there. If you're not there, well, you're not there.' This is not the ordinary sort of arrangements—and I think everyone here are from cities—that you consider in a city. I just think it's so enormously different.
                                                                                     </p>

If we're short in a muster, you just go into the pub and drag someone out. I really don't think the sorts of things we're talking about here apply in the farming situation. In some areas it does apply, but I use the word 'farming' not 'agriculture', because agriculture would include the sugar mills and industrial undertakings in farming, and I don't think they should be excluded from the ambit of this legislation. But farming itself, as opposed to agriculture, has to be excluded. Like so many of my colleagues, once again, I move that it be under 50. I think there's a good argument that it should be under 100, but I think really, Minister, 15 is too low. In the Senate, I think you've got to consider raising that a bit.

There was a cafe in Hughenden—I think the owner would be happy for me to use his name. It was Jimmy Marendy's cafe. The union bloke came around and said, 'What hours are you working?' The lady told him her hours. He asked: 'How much are you getting paid?' He said, 'Because your hours don't overlap, you should have got another 50 bucks a week off your employer.' So the owner had to pay them backpay. The owner of the cafe was earning less than the employee, which is pretty common in small business. There are some tax benefits, but really I think a lot of small-business owners are earning less than employees. So he shut the cafe and we had no cafe in Hughenden, and six people had lost their jobs. So this is not a shoe that fits all feet. It's just simply not. I think you've got to exclude to a certain level—

I've been with him with beef producers and canegrowers, and I've been in those same those banana-packing sheds that he referred to. Some of the greatest areas of underpayment and exploitation and low wages that we have dealt with are not necessarily in that part of Australia but have actually been in the agriculture sector and, often, in horticulture. I would be loathe to create a situation where those workers weren't able to have the chance of the benefits of some of the provisions that are in this bill. For that reason the government won't be supporting the amendment, but understands exactly why it's being moved by the member for Kennedy.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                       Just in closing—because this will be the final moment of the debate—and for those who are wondering about the consideration in detail stage: this bill will have had the longest consideration in detail on any bill since the marriage equality debate in 2017. You would have to go back to the previous Labor government before that to find a consideration in detail stage on any bill that has gone for as long as this one has. With that in mind, I request that this amendment now be put to the ballot.

I too represent a regional community, and I have to say that running a business in a regional community is very different. There are pressures on regional businesses that are not experienced in metropolitan areas. I'm talking about fires, floods and droughts, and the impacts those have on regional communities. That's why we have the rural business support scheme, a scheme that I support very much.

Many years ago, the centre of town had a really big stone shed; it's where we used to make ice cream, AMSCOL ice cream. That business closed and for many years, right in the heart of town, this huge, great big building was empty. Then we had Elders move in there for a few years and then, again, it was closed—for many, many years. It's not like in metropolitan areas, where one business moves out and another business moves in. This really ended up being an empty shell full of rats and everything else. We then had a business move into the town, Coopers of Mount Torrens, and I have to say that the whole town celebrated. That is a small business that would be very much impacted by this industrial relations legislation that we have before us. I just don't think that the government is really thinking deeply about the impact of this legislation on regional businesses across Australia. I would very much urge the government, perhaps in the Senate, to have a look at regional Australia and our small businesses, to try to provide some protections for them.

As he has rightly highlighted in his contribution, the primary industry sector is enormously important to Australia's prosperity. Indeed, there is a goal of achieving export income of $100 billion. There has been very significant progress towards that over the last few years and the coalition strongly supported that when in government.
                                                                                        </p>

Many farming enterprises are family businesses, being built up over generations, and many farming businesses take substantial risks: if there's a drought, that could go for a year, or two years—or four or five. The harvest could fail, and that can happen, year after year after year. Families in many cases there are really hanging on, and it's very, very tough. It's a boom and bust industry: of course there are other times that are good—global commodity prices are high, the weather is good and the harvest is good, and farmers receive a substantial sum of money for their harvest.
                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                         But of course that cyclicality, that boom-and-bust nature, is something that's unlikely to be looked on in any receptive way by aggressive unions seeking to push into territories that they presently do not have a strong presence in. And we know that's one of the agendas behind this bill: it's to expand the role of the union movement to support it to get greater coverage, across many different parts of the economy, and there's no doubt that farming is one of the sectors in their sights. So, this government is of course dancing to the tune of the union paymasters.

The point I make—and it's a passionate one—is that the farming communities we have right across this nation live in a very different place to those that live and operate in this place. This is a sterile place. This is a place where decisions are made on numbers. However, the risks that are encountered by the farming community are immense.

There would be a team to wash the teats of those animals, there would be another team to put the teat cups on, there would be another team to take the teat cups off, there would be another person there to apply Redene disinfectant to the animal. Then another person would take that herd back out to the paddock and another employee would get on a tractor with a fertiliser applicator to fertilise the pasture. After that, someone would come along and grab the spray rig and they'd go out to apply spray to that piece of pasture. But the point I make is that each part of that labour chain requires a person, and the total number of these casual employees doing very specific work adds up to an aggregate, which is exactly, I think, where the member for Kennedy is going with his point about the peculiarities of farming.

It means that we need to have casual labour coming in from time to time, depending on the weather, depending on the season. Again, that's peculiar to farming. We're coming in to harvest time in the state of Tasmania.

It's like a different planet, and until we understand the nuances and the peculiar requirements necessary to conduct that agricultural operation then we're not doing them any service at all. Finally, I'd like to say that they've got enough to put up with. The environmental compliance, the animal husbandry compliance, the industrial relations compliance—these are not people that have specialised people in offices or departments to deal with IR legislation. These are mum-and-dad businesses, and when mum or dad is taken away that means that 50 per cent of their business has stopped being effective. Farmers and our farming communities, our agricultural sector right across—

We've had a good discussion on this and we're at a point now where, once we finish the amendment debate, we will go immediately through to the final stages of the bill. The parliament now has a chance to get wages moving. I think we should proceed with that now and I ask that the amendment now be put to the House.
