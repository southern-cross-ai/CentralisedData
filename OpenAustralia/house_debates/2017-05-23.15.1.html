        A number of years ago I spent a night with Senior Sergeant Bob Simpson of the Mildura police force. We talked about the role of domestic violence intervention orders and how, if you crossed over the river in Mildura, it was not binding when you got to the other side of the river, because of course you were in the state of

        . It is pleasing that, after some advocacy in this chamber and now some work, the federal government is working towards Australia-wide intervention orders. The federal, state and territory justice ministers have agreed on a national framework that will allow for domestic violence orders issued in one state to be recognised and enforceable in any jurisdictions. There is a system being set up, called

        , which will ensure that police, when they go to intervene, will know that this person has that intervention order against them.

        It is very pleasing for me as a member of this government that we have been proactive about taking some steps to address this anomaly. We welcome state borders, but we need to make sure that at all times we protect the victims of family violence. We have more to do in this place. As well as protecting those who are victims of family violence, we still have to go out there and make sure that we teach our young men to be gentlemen and to respect the women in their lives. In doing so we can make sure that ultimately we get rid of this scourge out of the Australian community.
