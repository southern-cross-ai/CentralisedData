       <p>
        Last week I had the privilege of visiting the Torch.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Torch" rel="nofollow">
         The Torch
        </a>
        is an organisation based in Macnamara that goes into our prison systems, works with Indigenous people who are incarcerated and helps them produce some of the most breathtaking art I have ever come across. All of the proceeds from the sale of those pieces of art go into programs and support for the artist to turn around their lives and to help support them as they come back into our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an incredible success. Not only is the art completely and utterly brilliant and awesome but also the program has been a success story for people like Thelma. Thelma Beeton is a Palawa woman living in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda" rel="nofollow">
         St Kilda
        </a>
        . She sold over 135 pieces through the Torch. She has built a sense of self-worth and has been out of incarceration for over four years. We're really proud of Thelma. We also, in my office, are so pleased to have a couple of works from the Torch on display, including a new one which will be done by the artist Coadz, and it was titled
        <i>
         One Mob
        </i>
        . I'll read out his description: '
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This painting shows a strong, tall kangaroo who is looking back at his past and time spent in prison. He is ready to move forward with the support of all the brothers he met on his journey and family on the outside. He knows in his heart this time he will succeed!
       </p>
       <p>
        It's for stories like that that the Torch is just remarkable.
