        . It also organised a cracker ironman and hosted the Lake Macquarie Games.

        Belmont Swansea has been a fantastic club. Over the years it has hosted both state and national titles. It has a very experienced group at its club. They are very dedicated people who have been involved with their club for a very long time. I thank the

        , Chad Griffith, my next-door neighbour, who did a fantastic job on the night.

       <p>
        Caves Beach Surf Life Saving Club has 626 members, 220 juniors and a very impressive 27 cadets, 16 trainers and seven assessors. It completed 22 rescues, 2,794 preventative actions and 49 first aids, closed the beaches 20 times over the season and performed 5,987 patrol hours, worth a massive $120,000 to Lake Macquarie City Council. It is a very strong, united club, a family club. There are up to three generations of members at that club from the same family. They perform well on the beach and perform very well as far as safety is concerned. It organises the ocean-beach swim and participates in many events throughout the Hunter region.

        Congratulations to these outstanding surf clubs.
