       <p>
        Politics can be unfair and it can be cruel, as it has been for my friend Jennifer Kanis, who yesterday conceded defeat in the state seat of Melbourne. She did so with a characteristic grace. Sadly, she could not overcome the weight of money and resources thrown against this progressive woman by those indifferent to the concerns of those who rely on government for dignified and secure lives. She will be missed.
       </p>

        Her by-election victory was extraordinary and inspirational. In many ways, it set up Saturday's result for Labor in Victoria. As a member of parliament she built on this win, in the community and in the parliament. Having been a great teacher and a much better lawyer than me, she excelled as a representative of the place she lives in and loves. I am so proud to know Jen and call her my friend. Even yesterday, her thoughts were with others, not for herself. Jen and her family—husband Davydd and son Blake—are in the thoughts of all of us in the Victorian Labor Party.

        I think also today of her wonderful staff—

        , and of all those who worked so hard for Labor in Melbourne. They will be feeling bruised and disappointed. But let me say this to all of them: you should also be proud of all you did to make real change in Victoria. I am so proud of you and of your contributions. Jen, your qualities are needed in public life. I hope that in good time—in your time—you choose to return to it.
