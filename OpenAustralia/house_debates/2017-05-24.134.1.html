        Behind the horror headlines of 22 people dead in the latest terrorist incident, this time in Manchester, no doubt exist tragic human stories. Here we had the concert of a pop star,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande" rel="nofollow">
         Ariana Grande
        </a>
        , and you can imagine the young teenage girls who were so excited about going to the concert. For many of them, I am sure, it was probably their first concert. Yet life has been snuffed out for so many. It is a reminder to each of us of the sanctity of human life and the sanctity of young life. It is also a sombre reminder that in the West, our way of life is, indeed, under attack. And it is a sombre reminder that we need to remain resolute in celebrating and protecting that way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is why I, for one, celebrate the fact that our most recent budget included a measure of $1.5 billion for further investment in security agencies. We need to ensure that Australia as a nation collaborates further with other intelligence agencies; that we build more sophisticated surveillance, particularly around public areas, together, of course, with much better hard infrastructure assets to protect the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think each of us also has a role to playâ€”not just government and not just agencies. I think each of us has a role to play in protecting our way of life and in knowing that what binds us as a nation is a set of values. There is no more important principle foundation value than freedom. Freedom is something that each of us enjoy individually but its protection is something that has to be shared. The people of the United Kingdom, particularly the people of Manchester, have demonstrated that. I know everybody in parliament here in Australia not only shares their anguish but is inspired by the way neighbour has helped neighbour in Manchester.

        I am too old to know Ariana Grande's songs, but I did grow up listening to the likes of the Hollies, another wonderful Manchester band, and in one of their songs the lyrics are:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The road is long
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With many a winding turn
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That leads us to who knows where
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Who knows where
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But I'm strong
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strong enough to carry him
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He ain't heavy, he's my brother
