          Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is a fair question. This is a very serious process. It is about accountability. I think they should be front and centre in terms of their ministerial responsibilities.

            I will be raising these issues further because I think accountability is very important—as you yourself know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as a former minister of the

            parliament. I would like to go first to the issue of ethanol—something dear to the hearts of some members of this parliament because they are very close to companies such as Manildra. I would like the parliamentary secretary to advise on the following matters. Given the growing food versus fuel debate, what is the government doing to promote the development of lignocellulosic ethanol production in Australia? What progress has been made on meeting ethanol and biodiesel targets? Are there any problems with meeting supply, given the drought? Can the parliamentary secretary also advise whether the department has done any work on whether or not the potential mandating of ethanol by some state governments could at one point in the future lead to an increase in the price of petrol in Australia?

            <p>
             I thank the honourable member for Batman for his question. We have actually spent $50,278,000, projected for 2006-07, and the budget estimate for the year after that is $63.4 million. The honourable member raises the question about setting mandated targets. The federal government have stated over and over that we do not see that as a position for this government. It should be done by consumer choice driving demand. We do support the development of an ethanol industry, but it is something that should not be forced upon the consumer. If state governments want to regulate in such a way, that is a matter for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The federal government is providing financial support, but it is also up to those who are producing the ethanol to explain to motorists, to consumers, the exact benefits, whether they are environmental or economic, to make sure that it is a viable proposition. That is our position on it. It has been well stated in the parliament by the minister. We encourage the industry to grow and develop. I know that my colleague here, the member for Gilmore, has a huge plant, the Manildra plant, in her electorate and has been a very strong advocate for ethanol. Whilst I am sure she would like to see mandated levels, she understands that people should choose this rather than have it forced upon them.

              I seek to remind the parliamentary secretary that the question went to: what is the government doing with respect to the potential development of lignocellulosic ethanol in Australia? What has been done to meet its targets with respect to ethanol to date? Are there any potential problems emerging with the drought and what is now an international debate on food versus fuel? Has the government done any work on the potential impact of mandating fuel prices in Australia because of an almost monopoly producer in Australia?

                I am advised by our department that our Biofuels Capital Grants program, which commenced in 2003-04, with some $24.3 million of investment, has continued to grow. This year there is $20,225,000 to be taken up as part of that. As for other particulars, I can understand where the member is going in trying to get the government to commit to mandated levels, but we will not commit to mandated levels—

                   Could we get to the facts of the budget, instead of having a debate between the parliamentary secretary and the member for Batman. If the member for Batman could identify sections of the budget that he wants questions answered on, then we might be able to facilitate that.

                    Obviously the advisers have brought to the attention of the parliamentary secretary the issues that I have raised. The information is clearly not available. I ask that the questions be taken on board with a view to giving me the answers. I now go to the question of gas—

                     LNG

                    , gas to liquids. LNG demand is growing worldwide but it seems that LNG projects in Australia are still struggling to get off the ground—for example, the Gorgon project has been endeavouring to get going for six years. What is holding it up, and what other projects are planned or underway?

                     I last year had the opportunity to visit the Woodside onshore processing facility out near Dampier. This is a huge investment. Unfortunately for the member for Batman, infrastructure cannot be built as quickly as he would perhaps like. But let us remember that it was this government that put together the $25 billion deal with China. It was this government that participated in the onshore delivery facility in China. And this government is looking at markets. Every week there are people coming to this country looking for more and more supplies of gas from Australia. But infrastructure development is also at times held up through environmental issues that need to be dealt with, and again I point to the Woodside facility, which has some issues to deal with—Aboriginal stone artefacts and paintings. That is but one. All of the other fields and platforms are taking time in process. If we look at the Timor facility, that is taking a long time just in the negotiation of treaty to establish a commencement date. In fact, I had the pleasure of, on behalf of the minister, putting the bill before this House on the financial split under the Sunrise treaty and the cooperation that will go beyond.

                    <p>
                     I agree with the member for Batman: there is huge demand for our gas in this country, but part and parcel of that is getting the infrastructure developed to access it. I also point out to the member for Batman that this country, through
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     , has invested a massive amount of money in exploration—by seismic and other methods—to understand where these pockets are. In addition to that, the government is committed to facilitating, through free trade agreements, even greater access to overseas markets for our product. We will continue with that. In relation to the questions that the member for Batman asked prior to that, we will take those on board and we will respond. I could not quite hear what he was saying, and I apologise for that—that is my hearing going—but I thought that he was asking about mandated levels of blended fuels. As I said, the government’s position on that is well known: we are not going to set a target, but we will encourage industry to develop and be competitive in the marketplace.

                      I appreciate the parliamentary secretary’s comments on ethanol. I clearly do not support mandating. The issues I raise are serious issues, going to what is a very complex debate now about where we go on ethanol and whether or not what is occurring in some states is potentially going to have an impact on the price of petrol generally because of an almost monopolistic position of Manildra with respect to ethanol production in the future, and consumers possibly being the losers. But that is an issue to be followed up by the department, because I think Australian consumers want an answer to that question of whether or not there are alternatives to the Manildra type of production, such as lignocellulosic ethanol production. Continuing with respect to the fuel debate: what is the status of the titles over the Gorgon and

                        Further, when the government considers retention lease renewal, will it take into account the concerns of domestic gas customers about the willingness of gas sellers to develop fields for the domestic gas market? Secondly, is the government aware that, despite the fact that there are generous tax incentives, the industry is calling for further tax incentives? What is the government’s view about those demands from industry, given the fact that they are already sitting on considerable reserves which they have failed to develop? Will the government also consider a policy option of ‘use it or lose it’, effectively forcing the industry to develop the reserves that they are currently sitting on?

                        <p>
                         I thank the honourable member for his question. As I am advised, and I am sure that the member would be aware, the gas pockets that are contained on the mainland of Australia actually come under the purview of the state governments for administration. The federal government, through the offshore gas and oil industry, has control of those pockets. We have been spending a considerable amount of money on research, through
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                          Geoscience Australia
                         </a>
                         , to identify those pockets. We have been able to roll out leases for people to take up in relation to those. When we look at the investment and development of things such as the Woodside project and the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Shelf" rel="nofollow">
                          North West Shelf
                         </a>
                         , if we look at the money that is being tipped into the Sunrise project and if we look at research into offshore areas and whether the Bremer Basin contains gas, we will see that these are all things in the future. But I can understand the member’s concern about ensuring domestic supply of gas in Australia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I am also advised that there is more than ample gas available for domestic supply in Australia, and part of the proof of that is the fact that the government rolled out a massive subsidy in the middle of the fuel crisis to get cars converted to
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
                          LPG
                         </a>
                         . The take-up of that has been quite phenomenal. Every time the price goes up, the applications to gain access to an LPG vehicle conversion or the $1,000 subsidy for a new vehicle seems to go up. That being said, the delay in that process is, of course, in part due to the delay in accessing installation. Security of supply is critical and we accept that. That is why we take a broad approach to the total amount of availability of gas, oil and, indeed, coal in Australia and how we measure that out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Also, there are people such as those in
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGL" rel="nofollow">
                          AGL
                         </a>
                         who have been involved in looking at establishing the pipeline from
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
                          PNG
                         </a>
                         oilfields to Australia. People are looking at investing in and developing opportunities there. Of course, for security of supply in my own area in the Hunter, there is a lack of gas availability for domestic and some industrial consumers in the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
                          Hunter Valley
                         </a>
                         . Through state governments opening up monopolistic attitudes, there are private investors looking at establishing gas supply lines for domestic consumption. I can assure the member that there will be, in the foreseeable future—no doubt in my lifetime or, indeed, our children’s lifetimes or our grandchildren’s lifetimes, and a few beyond that—no shortage in the supply of gas reserves in Australia.

                             This government does not shoot from the hip when it comes to providing solutions. We establish legal frameworks so that people have security in making investments, knowing that there are set pieces of legislation that governments will adhere to. If we were to keep jumping and hopping around and there was no security through legislation, what impact does the member for Batman think that would have on investment in Australia?

                             I accept that iron ore is a big earner for Australia. There is an opportunity to increase our exports from this nation. But we will not be the government that shoots from the hip and makes ad hoc decisions without reviewing them through the processes that have been used by governments since time immemorial in this place to review things with adequacy and impartiality.

It is important that the states recognise—as the member for Batman said last night—that there is a need, in partnership with federal, state and of course local government, to find ways of achieving solutions. We need to see some of the royalties that are achieved invested back into infrastructure, which would go part of the way towards solving some of these problems. I do understand that the issue in relation to the single rail line owned by one proprietor—

                                     Talk about one delivered on a platter! The member opposite, the member for Batman, has just said that their shareholders want to invest money in Australia—we love that; we do everything we can to encourage that—but they want to know that their investment is secure. So I would again put the statement to the chamber that the government cannot just change legislation, ad hoc, to suit individual cases without going through a proper process. I acknowledge that the task force has reported back to the government, but surely the member opposite can understand that the appropriate place to review the question of competition is the

                                      Unfortunately there is a lack of understanding. This is a major legal issue at the moment, and companies have made requests to government to legislate and fix it. But I will move on. Where is the government’s current consideration of a flowthrough shares proposal for the mining industry so as to encourage investment, especially amongst small- and medium-sized miners?

                                       This is like deja vu. I thought that was exactly the same question you asked last year, Member for Batman. Our position has not changed. Of course one must work within one’s budget and always attempt to finish the day, like business, with more money in one’s pocket than what one spends. We have been able to do that—unlike most state governments, four of which are continuing their process in debt, not profit. The government do not see that it is economically viable for our nation to provide flowthrough share schemes at the moment. That does not mean that in the long-term they are out. These things are discussed during each and every budget review process, but it is not in the budget this year.

                                        I direct a question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in relation to the appropriations bills. I would be interested to know as the federal member for Ryan, representing the wonderful western suburbs of Brisbane, the implications of the appropriation bill in terms of Australian tourism, given that the Ryan electorate that I represent relies very significantly on it in terms of employment. Thousands of residents in the electorate of Ryan are employed in tourism, and I have in the Ryan electorate the lowest unemployment rate of all of the federal electorates, at 1.8 per cent. I would be keen to know from the parliamentary secretary the significance of the budget bill and the benefits and the significance for Australian tourism nationally as well as for Australians across the country and, of course, for the Ryan electorate in particular.

                                         I thank the member for Ryan for his question and I congratulate him on the hard work that he does as a member of parliament in bringing the tourism industry and other industries together as a cohesive force so as to have a low unemployment rate. That is well done, and it comes about through the ability to bring people together and give them an opportunity to have a job. It has been well heralded in this place. Our industrial relations reforms have contributed massively to the reduction in unemployment. I point out to the member that the amount of money that is being spent on tourism funding—$193 million—is directly on the back of the money that has been expended and will continue to be expended for this coming financial year from the tourism white paper. Ministers Hockey and Bailey are adamant about providing long-term support for our tourism industry, putting our best foot forward, approaching markets in new ways and refreshing ideas to get more people to come to Australia.

                                        <p>
                                         Of course, our ‘So where the bloody hell are you?’ campaign has been a great success in markets. But some expect that you advertise today and the benefit is there directly tomorrow; some ill-informed people think that you run your ad in England today and tomorrow people are booking. The flowthrough effect of these ads is in the long term. But one thing that is interesting is that, in tourism expenditure, the Queensland state government have barely kept pace with inflation. So, in real terms, in the last seven years we have seen an increase from the Queensland state government of only some $7 million—and they call themselves the tourism state! We say that they should be expanding their investment in tourism, as indeed should all states.

                                         is also doing a tremendous job. For a territory with a population of just over 150,000 people, its spending has gone from $26.7 million in the year 2000 to $38.3 million now: an increase of nearly 30 per cent. So they understand that tourism brings dollars to town. Queensland does well from tourism by sheer virtue of the natural asset it has there in the

                                         We have also seen an increase in investment in the Australian Tourism Development Grant Program. Some of the areas of outback Queensland are also affected by drought and we have seen an increased investment in drought tourism packages. These are there for people to apply for and take advantage of to increase their tourism opportunity. The one thing that we know as we move around to talk to various groups in the tourism industry is that if you do not keep refreshing your ideas, your attitudes and your approach then your market share will diminish. That is why we had to take a very bold and brazen step and put a wake-up call out there internationally by developing the ‘So where the bloody hell are you?’ campaign. I believe, as do many people in the tourism industry—who are providing their own support and investment funding through their own advertising on the back of the Brand Australia advertising—that this program will deliver in bounds. The ‘Throw another shrimp on the barbie’ campaign was outstandingly successful. I believe that this program will take tourism awareness internationally for Brand Australia to the same heights.

As such, I would be very keen on the parliamentary secretary’s response to this question. It is around the tourism industry’s response to the budget’s allocation for tourism promotion. Can the parliamentary secretary also inform me and the House whether other stakeholders or interested parties may have commented on the appropriation bill’s specific allocation of dollars to the promotion of the tourism industry? I would be keen to hear, as I am sure the residents of Ryan who depend on the tourism industry’s integrity and the tourism industry’s continuing success would be keen to hear, what the tourism industry’s representatives and other stakeholders or interested parties might have commented given this is such a profound and significant industry for the continuing prosperity of our country and the economic security of individuals and their families.

                                               I thank the member for Ryan for his question in relation to investment in tourism. On the figures that are provided to me, I would say to the honourable member that the Australian Tourism Development Program—four years at a cost of $24.9 million—will be providing an additional $10 million over the next two years as part of government investment. That of course is for drought affected areas. I acknowledge that the member does not exactly have a drought affected area, but I know that the member is on very high level water restrictions in his region.

The response by the industry relief was one of relief to see that we were continuing that investment with some $193 million to continue the great work of

                                               but the newer and evolving markets in areas like China and other areas through Asia and particularly the work that is being done in India at the moment—these will provide great economic benefit. At times the average punter in Australia would look at India and China as being relatively poor markets. Yet the level of middle class with high levels of disposable income in those two countries equates to more than the market approach that we would be able to deliver out of Europe or the

                                               I know that the member for Ryan has been doing a lot of work, particularly in liaising with the Chinese market and bringing business tourism to Australia and trying to encourage investment into his area and his region, and for that work he is to be congratulated. He goes out on the front foot looking for opportunities for his region, unlike many other people who would just sit and wait and ask, ‘What about me?’ Here is a fine member of parliament who goes out on the front foot and looks for opportunities in his electorate. For that he is to be congratulated and he is a good member of parliament.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               When we look at further investment, there are many opportunities that people can tap into to develop tourism projects in Australia—not just the Australian Tourism Development Program; there are other areas and aspects in relation to outlying areas in regional Australia where people can apply for regional and rural partnerships to develop tourism opportunities. So again I congratulate the member on the fine work that he does in his electorate and on behalf of his region in driving forward tourism growth and opportunities and I hope he continues his work in the future.

Can the parliamentary secretary also advise me with respect to the decline in the Japanese market, which fell 9.2 per cent over the last six months, and how quickly the government considers that a Japanese soap opera will turn this Japanese decline around? Will the minister for tourism and small business audition for the soap opera? Secondly, given the importance of tourism to the

But, in relation to open skies, that question would be better addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who at the end of the day has the ruling on that. But let me say this: we encourage people coming to Australia. When we look at Tiger or Asian airways that are looking at our facilities—in particular, they are looking at providing their hubbing out of regional areas—it is to be encouraged.

Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the amount given by the state government was absolutely zero. So there was no money for tourism infrastructure, as the member has just alluded to, in the way of roads, but this government is committed not just with the money it has already spent with

Safer roads increase tourism opportunities. It is a pity state governments do not wake up to that.

The significance of Tourism Australia, as the parliamentary secretary has already touched on, is to steer significant projects that promote Australia internationally. Given this is a very important body in the architecture of Australia’s tourism industry, I would be very keen to hear from the parliamentary secretary about Tourism Australia’s structure and perhaps the future chairman. If he is able to elaborate on that, I would be most grateful.

He had overseas contacts, he had overseas understanding and he knew markets; and he brought that to the board of Tourism Australia. It will be sad to see Tim go, because of the contribution that he has made, but we all get a little bit older and we also have a lot of demands on our time in other areas. In relation to the new

                                                           These programs that we are developing and rolling out across various countries will take time to pick up. As I said at the very beginning, unless you keep refreshing your ideas and your attitudes, unless you go out of your way to build new relationships with travel agents, with opinion makers in those countries who influence the local media, if you sit back and do what you have always done then you are going to achieve nothing better. You cannot ride on the past; you have to drive into the future. I think our new tourism markets that we are developing—as I said, particularly exciting will be those in China and India—will provide great benefits to Australia. The member for Batman talked about the drop-off in the Japanese market and then straightaway started to condemn the approaches we take to try to refresh our ideas and access to the Japanese market.

Tourism attitudes over the last 10 to 20 years have changed. They are no longer purely repetitive markets. This may be a one-time destination for people who come here and they may go to a different destination next time they take a holiday. I will give you an example of that.

The investment in infrastructure in those ports has provided opportunities for high-spend, high-yield markets to come to Australia. There are problems that evolve that we will need to deal with in relation to visas and those aspects—but it is a new approach. Why are they coming to Australia? These are boats that would traditionally tour the Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean, but new people, with new wealth and new opportunities, are not repetitive travellers. They will not go and spend every holiday on the Mediterranean on their boat. They will not go to the Caribbean every holiday. They are looking for a new adventure, a new place to fill, and Australia is very well placed to take up those opportunities.

Not only do they come here for their vacation or holiday; it also gives them an insight into Australia which can develop into an investment program perhaps for growing and emerging business benefits that they might want to achieve. I think that the next five to 10 years in tourism in Australia will grow in leaps and bounds in numbers, in yield and, the bottom line, in jobs, particularly in the southern Queensland region, and there will be employment growth through that facility.

                                                              I am pleased to present the 2007-08 Environment and Water Resources portfolio appropriations to the Main Committee of the House of Representatives. The budget delivers historic levels of funding to address the key environmental issues confronting us today—water scarcity, climate change and sustainable land management. In this year, 2007-08, the Australian government’s environment related spending will increase to a record $4.3 billion. In the course of its life, the government has spent more than $20 billion on environmental conservation and protection.

                                                              There is no greater threat today to the long-term economic and environmental welfare of this nation than climate change and water scarcity. As the Prime Minister recently announced, Australia will move to develop what will be the world’s best domestic emissions-trading system by 2012. This will be the most comprehensive emissions-trading scheme in the world, covering the sources of 75 per cent of all emissions.

                                                              Our total commitment to fighting climate change now stands at $2.8 billion. Climate change is a global problem. Global warming is a global problem and it needs a global response. To be environmentally effective, we have to work collaboratively with the world’s largest emitters. We have to work collectively to make the dramatic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions that science tells us we need by the middle of this century. Just to put a frame of reference around the scale of cuts that we need that is comprehensible: in order to achieve the cuts in emissions that science tells us the world needs by mid-century, we will need to have by the middle of this century almost all of our stationary energy and most of our transport energy coming from zero or near zero emission sources. That is an incredible technological transformation that we have to reckon with and deal with. That is the scale of the technological challenge which we are speaking of. There are people who like to suggest that the response to climate change, the response to global warming, will be easy, will be cheap and will not be much of a problem. It is a massive change. It is a technological change on a par with the industrial revolution itself.

                                                              So we are working very hard with the major emitters—in particular China and the United States—to develop the confidence and the collaboration necessary for this effective global response. At the same time, we are focused on early action. There are two areas of early action that are most promising and most achievable. The first is forestry, where we are literally leading the world in a new Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, investing $200 million over five years to stop deforestation in developing countries and promote reforestation and sustainable forestry management. Of course, that $200 million is not sufficient to undertake this massive task alone, but it is designed to motivate and galvanise other countries to partner with us in this enormous effort. If we could simply halve the rate of deforestation, we would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 10 per cent, which is more than 10 times the effect of Kyoto.

                                                              Turning from climate change to water: no Australian government has ever committed as much in resources to water as the Howard government has, through the $2 billion Australian Government Water Fund, the National Water Initiative—that groundbreaking intergovernmental agreement—and, most recently, the $10 billion National Plan for Water Security, tackling the problems of overallocation and inefficient use of water in the agricultural areas of Australia, where 70 per cent of our water is used. So these are massive contributions to these key challenges of climate change and water scarcity.

Minister, given that in 2006 the government allocated $200 million to recover 200 gigalitres of water entitlements for the Murray through a tender for water efficiency, which closed on 14 February 2007, can you confirm that only $765,000 was actually spent on purchasing water entitlements through this tender? Can you confirm that only three tenders were accepted, recovering only 454 megalitres of water entitlements—0.2 per cent of the volume that the government aimed to recover? What is happening to the excess funding, the $199 million that remains of the $200 million that you anticipated would be spent on this tender? How can you explain the absolute failure of this tender process, where almost no water has been recovered under the tender?

                                                                The honourable member knows that he is misrepresenting the situation, and it is disappointing that he would be so disingenuous. There was never an allocation of $200 million to the tender. In fact, when the tender was announced, I was very cautious about whether we would buy any water at all. The only reference to the figure 200 was that we said we would certainly not buy more than 200 gigalitres, because that was on the high side of the forecast shortfall of the 500-gigalitre target for the Living Murray Initiative. The tender was always stated to be experimental—and you can dig up my press releases and statements of the time—and we specifically did not set a target. I said many times that I did not know whether we would be buying a little water, a lot of water or no water at all. It was an experimental effort and, as much as anything else, was designed for us to understand a bit about the market and the preparedness of people to tender water in circumstances where they had to derive that water from efficiency measures. So the fundamental premise of the member for Grayndler’s question is completely wrong. He is misstating the facts.
                                                               </p>

                                                                Turning to the tender itself, with the way the Commonwealth procurement rules work, the maximum price that can be paid has to be set before the tenders come in. So it is not like a typical book-build where you are buying shares for a company or some sort of financial transaction. It has some unusual characteristics. The price was set at a level, based on advice, which was above but not significantly above market price. From the time that price was set in a process that was very much at arms-length from the government, obviously for probity reasons and so forth, a number of things happened: firstly, the drought drove water prices up, so water became much more valuable; and, secondly—and this really is what had the biggest impact on the tender—the Prime Minister announced the National Plan for Water Security about 10 days, as I recall, before the due date for the close of the tender.
                                                               </p>

                                                                The National Plan for Water Security overwhelmed this tender because the National Plan for Water Security involves irrigators being subsidised into saving water through efficiency measures, with the Commonwealth paying the bulk of the cost and the water savings being shared, whereas, under the tender, the irrigator would have to spend all the money—100 per cent of the money—on saving water and then sell that water, the product of his savings, to the Commonwealth. So, many irrigators would have looked at the National Plan for Water Security and said that that is a much better deal and accordingly been prepared only to tender for the water through efficiencies tender at a much higher price. So the fact that there were a small number of bids that came in under the threshold price was no surprise to us at all. It was entirely expected. In fact, in some respects, given the National Plan for Water Security and the fact that it presented to many people a significantly better deal, it was surprising that we had any offers at all.
                                                               </p>

                                                                As far as purchasing more water is concerned, the honourable member will be interested to learn that at the recent Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting there was a resolution to buy a further 20 gigalitres of water on market by the commission which of course will be using Commonwealth government funds as part of the $500 million we contributed last year. They will be on-market purchases without any strings attached, not related to efficiency measures, and will be done through brokers. That will happen in the latter part of this year. So the purchase of water is certainly happening. The MDBC will be in the market. Indeed, water purchases are part of the National Plan for Water Security.

The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will recall the Prime Minister’s speech on 25 January which warned about the danger of not taking decisive action on the water crisis. The appropriations being debated in the parliament today indicate that just $53 million will be spent in the coming financial year, 2007-08, and, of that, just $15 million will be spent on addressing overallocation. Why, if it is such a priority for the government, is the $10 billion announcement back-ended in terms of funding? If this were a priority, wouldn’t you expect it to be front-end loaded in terms of the spending?

Is it the case that the government has used the excuse of concern about the states? Given that it is a fact that the states were not consulted prior to the 25 January announcement, the release of these documents, which the state leaders have indicated they would approve being released, could not possibly cause damage to federal-state relations. Finally, can the minister confirm that the very brief costings table that was published when the Prime Minister addressed the

The scheduling of the spending is something that has been put together by the finance department. It takes a fairly conservative view about timing. But I have to say that, based on my now nearly 18 months experience in dealing with water projects, they all take a very long time for the money to be spent. If you think about this program, the bulk of the money is going to water efficiency and irrigation efficiency upgrades. We will be spending money on piping, lining channels, reconfiguring irrigation systems and so forth.
                                                                   </p>

Let us say we agree to fund some of those in the course of this year. I would certainly hope that we would be able to do that. Obviously, it is very much dependent on reaching a final agreement with the states on the plan. But, assuming that we can do that, I could see some projects being approved this year and some money being spent. But I have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as I am sure you know from your experience in rural Australia, the big dollars will be spent some time down the track because invariably with these water projects there is a lot of planning required and the scheduling of the construction and so forth takes time.
                                                                   </p>

If the projects are there and the money can be spent sooner, then we will do so. We are committed to getting on with the job. This is only an estimate.

But we are not limiting ourselves to those items. I have to say—and you see this with the Australian Government Water Fund projects—that there are projects for which we committed the money several years ago now where the full funds have not been drawn down. That is not due to any lack of preparedness to write the cheque; it is simply that the project has not advanced. These big water projects are long and laborious and they invariably take time. That is why, inevitably in a program of this kind, the expenditure will ramp up from low levels in the earlier years to higher levels in the later years.
                                                                     </p>

The decision was taken, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, by a senior official in the department. It was not a political decision. The answers to the honourable member’s questions are set out in the response from the department.

I also indicate that I found your last answer quite extraordinary. I am not sure whether you were justifying the fact that just half of one per cent of $10 billion will be spent in the coming financial year or whether you were suggesting that the $53 million was just a sort of vague figure, that you might spend more or less in terms of the appropriation that is there, so I would appreciate clarification of that.

Can the minister confirm that the report by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation states on page 6 that there were ‘no detailed site investigations’ and on page 68 that the report was:
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p class="italic">

                                                                         </p>

What were the sweeping assumptions that were used in the report? Can the minister confirm that there was no research on the energy consumption required to pump water more than 150 kilometres? Does the minister think this is an appropriate way to set policy? Can the minister also address the specific issue of why Commonwealth funding has been supported for the super pipeline to Bendigo but not to Ballarat, contrary to statements by the minister in the Ballarat media when he visited there that this proposal was consistent with the National Water Initiative’s principles and funding guidelines?

It is an estimate. If there is the opportunity to invest more in a nearer time frame then obviously that is something that we would have regard to. The objective is to get on with the job. Having said that, experience in large water projects—which the honourable member cannot lay any claim to, I am afraid—tells you that invariably these projects—

As I said, there are water projects which we committed funds to some years ago where the funds have not yet been drawn down. I am not suggesting that states have been negligent or slow or that councils have been negligent or slow, but these projects do take time.

I was very careful to keep expectations very low. I genuinely did not know how much water would be available. Given the nature of the tender—it was a very valuable experiment; we learned a great deal from it—I did not know how much water would be available from that tender at an acceptable price.

The decision was taken in 1989 to not build the Wolffdene dam, notwithstanding that it was obvious that the growth in south-east Queensland was ramping up. South-east Queensland is short of water because there has not been effective long-term planning. When you look at planning for water, you have to have every option on the table. One of the questions that has been talked about for many decades is: can water be brought from the

It is plain that there are a couple of feasible options on a desktop basis and, as the report indicated, further investigation needs to be done and there needs to be further discussion between New South Wales and Queensland. There is the potential for an integrated water scheme between northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Both northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland are going to need more water as they grow. So that report is literally no more than a first step, just to have a brief desktop analysis of some of the possibilities. It has been a very useful exercise from that regard, and clearly, as the report indicates and as I have always indicated, further work would need to be done. The reality is that we are committed to supporting—

The minister should stop his rhetoric and actually answer the question. The question that he has failed to address at all is: why were a number of sweeping assumptions made? Why was a committee asked to report on that basis? He says it is a desktop report. What sort of report into a dam for the Clarence and the Tweed is it that has no site investigations? Not surprisingly, he has not responded at all to his failure to support the super pipe going not just to Bendigo but to Ballarat.

The critical issues—and this is where the desktop study was very valuable—were: firstly, to examine the hydrological data to form a view about the amount of water that is actually available in any given stream, and that is critical: what is the level of regulation that could reasonably be applied to any given stream; and, secondly, to examine the cost of building the infrastructure. No sweeping generalisations are made there. Plainly, to take any project of this kind further, work involving many millions of dollars would need to be done, but of course you would have to get the support of the

But, unless you take the first step, unless you actually put the option on the table and say, ‘There’s a piece of work. Let’s see whether we want to take this further,’ you never get off first base.
                                                                                   </p>

We don’t like recycling because we don’t want recycled effluent finding its way into the drinking water system. We don’t like desalination because it uses too much energy.’ You take one option after another off the table and then you come back to square one and say, ‘But we’re running out of water.’ The critical thing to do with water infrastructure is to put every option on the table and promote an informed discussion. That report speaks for itself. I cannot expand on that, other than to make this observation: in terms of energy, water is very heavy. A thousand litres of water weighs exactly one tonne and it has a mass of one cubic metre. So moving water around costs a lot of money. The water industry is one of the biggest consumers of energy. But everything you do with water uses a lot of energy. Whether you are pumping it up hill and down dale, whether you are recycling it, whether you are desalinating it, you will find that every use of water is energy intensive—unless you happen to be fortunate enough to have a dam up in the hills and it can run downhill.

Can the volume of water that any one entity owns—be it a person, a business or a local, state or even federal government—be identified by name of person, business or government throughout the basin? If not, will the National Plan for Water Security and the $700 million that is being allocated to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission for in part water trading purposes ensure that such information is readily available in the short term—by July 2008, for example? Is the minister aware of any media reports throughout the country lately of companies with no interests in agriculture buying up licences in a big way? What concerns would you have if that is correct?

It buys water licences from mostly dairy farmers in the lower part of the Murray in order to augment Adelaide’s water supply. I do not know whether the member for Hindmarsh regards that as a bad thing, but perhaps he could put out a press release criticising SA Water and the Labor government of South Australia for doing that, if he disagrees with it; it is up to him.

So the honourable member could go to the internet and find out who owns what water and what types of water. He could find out what the reliability and security of the particular entitlements were in the different jurisdictions. So the answer is to have a basin-wide register, in effect, and with complete transparency.

That would be a worthy goal, but again this is a collaborative effort with the states. We are yet to reach a finalised agreement with the states, particularly Victoria, so I hesitate to put a precise time frame on that, but you can understand that we are committed to doing this as quickly as possible.

Under the National Water Initiative, the right to water is separated from land—although there remain some statutory restrictions in Victoria in that regard but not in the other states—but it is open for a non-landowner to buy water. There has not been a lot of evidence that I have seen to suggest this is happening on a large scale or in any significant way. Owning water—because of its nature, its bulk, its unpredictable reliability—without a connection or a direct involvement with agriculture poses very considerable risks unless of course you have another use for it like in industry or an urban water utility like

I note that in relation to clean energy alone a total of $37.7 million was not delivered. I refer the minister to information provided at Senate estimates last October where the department confirmed that between 1998 and 2006

The next year the government spent even less, just $0.6 million—that was $6 million less than budgeted. In 2005-06, the government spent $3 million—a total of $17 million less than budgeted. So over three years, in the face of the great environmental and economic challenge of climate change, the Howard government, it seems, has spent just over $5 million of its $75 million Solar Cities program; only seven per cent in total.

Minister, can you confirm that the government has spent only seven per cent of its Solar Cities program over three years? How do you reconcile your claim that no country in the world is doing more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions when your government—this government—confronted with the challenge cannot deliver on commitments of some three years ago?

We will contribute to an 87 million tonne a year cut in CO equivalent emissions from 2010—that is equivalent to eliminating all the emissions from the transport sector.

Solar Cities is a visionary new energy concept. It is experimental and involves demonstration. As with almost all of our solar energy measures, the idea is to demonstrate the technology and provide the demand that will in turn drive cost reductions through better technology, learning through doing and so forth. Four Solar Cities have been announced so far: Adelaide, Townsville, Blacktown and

That program is on track; it is doing well. I was in Alice Springs recently and there are some very innovative elements there. Solar has a great future, particularly in areas like Alice Springs, where the cost of grid connected power is so much higher than it is, say, in a big city like Sydney or Melbourne and so the cost differential is that much lower.

I do not know that I have ever put it quite that high, but Australia is certainly a world leader. I remind him that the great untruths that the honourable member spreads about the government’s climate change policy fly in the face of facts. Let us look at some inconvenient truths.

The honourable member has to grapple with some inconvenient truths of his own regarding climate change. Firstly, Australia is on track to meet its Kyoto target. Most developed countries are not. That is an undoubted fact. Secondly, we recognise the massive technological challenge that I spoke about earlier in terms of having most of our energy coming from zero emission and near zero emission sources by mid century. A key part of that has to be clean coal. That is recognised. Australia is playing a leading role and punching well above its weight in terms of clean coal technology development. The only other countries that are at the same cutting edge level as Australia are the Netherlands and the United States—because of its scale, it is obviously investing more than anyone else. Then we have forestry, which is another key issue. The member for

This is the second largest source of emissions, but because it was not his idea he poured scorn on it. That is the vanity of the Labor Party’s approach to climate change. Finally, there is energy efficiency, which is a hugely complex area. There are great opportunities there. Which was the first country to announce the phase out of inefficient lighting? Australia. On those objective measures, Australia is playing a leading role in the battle against climate change.

I refer the minister to his statement in the parliament on 26 March that through the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program over 750 members, all Australian businesses, are projected to achieve 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2010—that is a reduction of about three per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions. I also refer to Senate estimates of 22 May this year, which showed that, while there are over 750 members of Greenhouse Challenge Plus, only 85 greenhouse reduction plans have been independently verified and that, since January 2006, 86 members of the program have not renewed their membership. In other words, in the last 18 months more members have quit the program than the number of members whose emissions can be verified.

                                                                                            </p>

You will recall in the submissions that came before the committee that one constant theme was the lack of concerted and coordinated action at the national level. Minister, can you explain the reasons why this report has not been responded to by the government in the almost 22 months since its tabling? You will recall you were a very active participant in debates about the recommendations and the outcome of the report; but, since you have taken over the portfolio, I do not see any evidence of that same zeal and commitment being displayed. Could you please advise what actions you have taken and intend to take to drive national leadership on the sustainability of our cities issue?

It is a groundbreaking report, and I was delighted to work so constructively and cordially with the honourable member for Throsby in its preparation. Without giving a piecemeal response, there are a number of recommendations that, in effect, have already been acted on—or at least the government have introduced measures which match the recommendations in the report. Doubling the photovoltaic rebate is an obvious example. The honourable member for

It has gone up from $4 a watt, with a maximum of $4,000, to $8 a watt, with a maximum of $8,000, and as I recall—the member for Throsby can correct me if my memory fails me—that was one of the report’s key recommendations.

All of the rest of the measures that are in the report are ones that, in many respects, are now broadly in line with government policy. For example, if you think about the—

That, while not particularly glamorous, is vital because local consent authorities need to know what the rules are when developers want to have recycling on their projects and so forth.

The response will be forthcoming; it will be on a whole-of-government basis. But the honourable member knows that a number of the more specific recommendations are ones that either are consistent with or have become consistent with the government’s policies.

Does the minister mean that mandatory disclosure of energy efficiency in greenhouse performance of residences at point of sale and point of lease is broadly consistent with government policy? Does the minister also contend that the recommendation in relation to lifting the first homeowner grants scheme and aligning it with sustainability criteria is also broadly consistent with government policy? He seemed to indicate in his response that separate and specific recommendations are being picked up elsewhere in terms of government decision-making and policies. Are those three specific recommendations, in the minister’s view, broadly consistent with government policy? And when will we actually get the detailed response to the report? You say that it is going to be a whole-of-government approach—I understand that—but you still give me no indication 22 months after it was tabled when we will finally see the response.

I used the term ‘broadly’ deliberately. There are a number of issues that are addressed there and I am particularly familiar with the chapter on water, which as the honourable member knows is of particular interest to me. The focus there on recycling and reuse is plainly in four square—

In terms of energy, I mentioned earlier the doubling of the photovoltaic rebate. It was a very specific recommendation that the photovoltaic rebate be doubled. Whether that was a result of the wisdom of the environment committee being heeded by the government or other processes, obviously the views that were expressed by the committee clearly had a big influence on my thinking because I was part of that committee and I listened very carefully to my colleagues. But I think that, rather than try to pick off individual items, it is better simply to conclude by saying that there will be a whole-of-government response and it will be in good time. It is important that it be done thoroughly and comprehensively and, when it is completed, it will be published in the usual way.

This year an AP6 meeting was scheduled for March 2007 but was indefinitely postponed and we are yet to hear whether any other country has made any other commitment other than to attend meetings. Foreign Minister Downer said in May this year the AP6 is making terrific progress. Since its foundering here last January, we are left to wonder exactly what this means. My question to the minister is: so far, how much money have China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States contributed to AP6? At the launch the Australian government said $25 million was exclusively earmarked for renewable energy technology. Can the minister confirm that this money has been fully spent or allocated?

This AP6 is likely to become the template for what will probably be the most effective global response. In terms of renewable energy, almost all of the $25 million for renewable projects has been committed, and the total amount will probably be committed before the end of this year.

Many countries, including China, India and Korea, are contributing expertise and other in kind resources in situ in projects in their own countries, where they are making their own contributions to the project as opposed to doing so through AP6. That is happening in respect of the almost 100 projects under AP6. Returning to the theme I started with, I cannot stress too much the scale of the technological challenge that the world faces. The member for Batman understands this very well.

We will need to have all or almost all of our stationary energy and most of our transport energy coming from zero emission sources.

It is as at the year 2000 and, of course, when you extrapolate it out to 2050, the volume is greater and the contribution from stationary energy and transport is that much greater. So, to achieve these big reductions, we need to move to our electricity and most of our transport coming from zero or near-zero emission sources.

They say that should not be an option. We have renewables. They have their own challenges because of their intermittency. We have hydro. The scope for increasing hydroelectricity is pretty limited almost everywhere in the world. So clean coal is going to play an enormous part in this mix. Every energy agency, every energy consultant, says the same thing. That is why the collaboration between Australia and the other AP6 countries on clean coal, particularly with China, is of such enormous importance. Ultimately, the solution to our global warming challenge will come through technology. Australia is seeking to have all of the technology options on the table. And, in respect of those technologies that need development, we are leading the charge.

Is the government also aware that projects worth $90 million out of a total of $93 million allocated to the strategic regional program in 2004 over a period of six weeks three years ago have not yet been completed? What has happened to the accountability mechanisms within DOTARS? Who is monitoring how the Commonwealth’s money is being spent? What is being done to get these projects completed or else recover the Commonwealth’s money? After all, they were announced over the six weeks of the last election campaign.

Minister, you will probably recall this, as I have written to you on a couple of occasions. On the last occasion, I wrote to the minister at the table on 9 May seeking to make out the economic case for widening the F5. The minister will recall that this is a stretch of road that sees more than 80,000 vehicle movements a day, 6,000 of those being movements of heavy vehicles. It is a main national piece of infrastructure, it is a piece of infrastructure which is critical to the development of the south-west of Sydney’s industrial and employment lands and it is something that this government has been put on notice about.

Certainly, in AusLink 2 it will be made very clear that we have expanded the network from the old national highway, including the roads of national importance. Further, we are working with councils and other states on where we can prioritise these projects.

It really does demonstrate some of the difficulties with states not having some responsibility within the funding criteria. We have seen some significant cost overruns on projects in Queensland, and I have used the analogy many times: if you were building a house and someone else was paying for it, you may not be quite as robust in considering or as concerned about any cost increases. At the moment, if there are any cost increases in Queensland, the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads,

It is true that there were differing agreements between each state and territory under AusLink 1. Those agreements were negotiated in the main by the senior portfolio minister. They took into account some variations and some concerns from the states. I believe that in AusLink 2 it would be preferable if we could have a uniform agreement. But there will always be cases—and you would never want to isolate yourself that there are not cases—where we could enter into a different funding arrangement for a different project.

The Australian government has indicated that it will fully fund the $2.3 billion cost. The Queensland government made it clear that it was not their preferred option, but certainly I have spent a lot of time in Queensland recently and the support from the community there and the local federal members is very strong. I cannot see the rationale of widening an already choked

At the end of the day you only end up with six lanes of traffic where ultimately, by building this Goodna bypass or the northern option, you can end up with two separate roads, which means that you are not going to have the blockages that you would have here and that would deal with the very rapid growth in that region for decades to come. I believe that in the long term it is the right decision to make and the Australian government is very strongly supportive of that. The Queensland government have made it very clear that in this particular case they do not favour what I believe is the best option and that they would not support contributing to that project.

It is obviously something that is of great interest at the moment, given the shipping incident at Newcastle and the number of coal ships that are queued up at the Newcastle port waiting to receive supplies. I understand it is an important issue for the honourable member and I am happy to provide what information I can.

It leads off from the previous question from the member opposite. Is it the minister’s experience that the states are up to date with their preplanning and planning? It has not been the experience in my electorate, where it took 4½ years to have the Gladstone port access road completed through a lack of planning and the state government instrumentalities taking that time to get their half of the funding together. There was a similar situation at the Bundaberg port ring-road. Is it the minister’s experience that the states in general, and Queensland in particular, are up to date with their preplanning to allow the Commonwealth money to be spent in a timely and efficient manner?

It is obviously of concern to all of us to ensure that the state governments actually have the information, the planning and the will to construct these major road projects. It is one of the difficulties with our federation insofar as the Commonwealth actually does not own any roads. Even when we construct them 100 per cent, they go back to the states as an asset for the states. We do not build the roads. We do not call the tenders. We do not manage the projects. So we are very much in the hands of the state governments in relation to timing. With the Ipswich-Logan interchange, which I mentioned, funding was available from around 2004 and yet construction has only just begun on that project.
                                                                                                                                    </p>

It took some six months before the Queensland government responded to our requests for priorities of projects and then it was the Queensland minister who was claiming that we were somehow holding up the progression of these particular projects. We need to have constructive goodwill from the states and territories and the Australian government because we cannot build these roads alone. And the community do not want the delays; they actually want us to get on with building roads. I again make the point that we are concerned that in some cases in the states and territories there seems to be a lack of willingness to get on with those projects.

The Sustainable Regions Program, I suppose, is the more glaring because there is a $15.5 million underspend in that program and it is due to run out in 2008. Not only is there that $15.5 million underspend, there is a $9.625 million underspend in the Regional Partnerships program. I find this intriguing and I ask the minister to enlighten us.
                                                                                                                                     </p>

I sought from the minister an opportunity to address the chairs, given that there is bipartisan support in this parliament—in fact, it was under me that they were established back in 1994-95. I thought this would have been an easy option to have responded to, but the minister refused. I offered to meet them separately and met more than half of them over the course of three days, but they tell me that their two major complaints are, in essence: firstly, that they are getting fed up with the inordinate amount of time it is taking the government to approve proposals; and, secondly, that their recommendations are not always taken into account. How is it that we can have the underspend on the one hand but complaints from the bodies charged with having to make recommendations to the government about the inordinate amount of time? That is the general question.
                                                                                                                                     </p>

I therefore want to know why the government has not adopted the recommendations of this parliament for greater transparency in the way in which these funds are administered. With regard to one particular recommendation, why does one of your ministers, Senator Johnston, still say that

It was clearly a recommendation of the Senate that that program be abolished.

It was an opportunity for us to discuss how we can continue to have open and transparent discussions in relation to Regional Partnerships. It is interesting that the Labor opposition stand up here and criticise the time it has taken to allocate funding through Regional Partnerships. As members opposite would be well aware, there were some changes undertaken in the process for Regional Partnerships. There is now a three-minister committee. It is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Special Minister for State,

We take into consideration the departmental recommendations. We also take into consideration a number of other matters. But, at the end of the day, ministers are appointed to make decisions in the best interests of their communities. The honourable member claims that he was the one who set up the area consultative committees, and I for one believe that they are an integral part of providing advice to the Australian government. It is something that we very much value.

But, at the same time, we want a rigorous process which looks at all of the elements for these projects. We will not rubber-stamp a project because of the time it has taken. We often will send projects back for further information before making a decision. That is something that I think is perfectly understandable and something that I would have thought the opposition would welcome.

At that time, when there was not so much focus on global warming and fuel prices, there was a really vicious attack on anyone who wanted to produce ethanol. There was seen to be a scare campaign that ethanol was going to damage cars. It really made it very difficult for anyone who wanted to get involved in alternative fuels such as ethanol. Now there seems to be a sudden change. Everyone seems to be wanting alternative fuels and the opposition suddenly supports it. But I remember that at that time there was a very strong and concerted attack on ethanol. Primary energy seemed to get linked up into that at that time. As far as the status of that project is concerned, I am happy to seek information from my department and provide anything that I can to you.

Can the minister please explain why the Commonwealth has not seen fit to fund any of this project given that the mining boom is providing most of the income coming to the Commonwealth? Thirty thousand people fly in and out of the airport each week to work in the mines that generate the money that goes to the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth cannot find it in its heart to come up with any funding for this project even though the royalties from the mining are going to the government.

Can the minister please explain why the Commonwealth sees fit to spend $200 million on advertising for the coming election but cannot spend any money on this highway?

This is not a road that is on the AusLink network. I take issue with the honourable member saying that the Australian government is getting all the royalties from mining. The Western Australian government of course has significantly increased its revenue from mining. It is the boom state of Australia. They should be rolling in money. They should be able to provide money for infrastructure as well and it really is a matter for the state government.

At this stage, there has not been a contract entered into in relation to the northern options. Obviously, it is early days yet. We are very keen to get on with the construction of the Goodna bypass, and I appeal to the Queensland government to fully cooperate with the Australian government in relation to this project. We are fully funding it, as you make the point. That is a decision of government. We have made that decision and we will fully fund that project. We need the cooperation of the Queensland government in relation to land acquisitions, the moving of services, the calling of tenders and the construction of this project. It is an important project to the people in the region. It is an important project to the local member,

I understand the significance of this capital works program. Can the minister tell me when the government made it a condition of their grant that the Queensland government also had to chip in? Was that made clear to the proponents of this scheme when they put their expressions of interest in as far back as a year and a half ago? Why is this new conditionality now before us? Isn’t this just another means by which the government can promise to upgrade the airport only to dud them when a condition that was never part of the deal is used as the excuse to not deliver on the money?
                                                                                                                                                              </p>

The reason we are getting underspends is that the government is not going through due process. It is making announcements on the run, it is making them in marginal seats to try and prop up their electoral interests and it is building in safeguards to avoid having to deliver down the track. That is the Longreach airport. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence is in the chamber. As a former president of the AMA he might be interested in this, because it is another horrendous underspend in what is otherwise a worthy cause, and that is the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund to help get doctors into remote and regional areas—a fund announced in 2004 and for which $15 million was committed. But here we are, three years later, and only $2 million has been spent. Why is it that the government has failed regional Australia so hopelessly in terms of delivering on this program? Has that money been rolled over? Is it still available for useful capital works?

I have to say, to take this opportunity, that I have noticed that that is happening right around Australia with the state governments. More and more they are reneging on their responsibility for projects, whether it be state rail or state roads or other state initiatives, whereby they are putting up projects and offering 50 per cent of what should be a 100 per cent responsibility for the states and then coming to the Commonwealth. Then, when the Commonwealth does not agree to fund a state government responsibility, they go back to their communities and say, ‘Oh, it’s all the federal government’s fault.’ It is not all the federal government’s fault and I think the community is starting to wake up to that in many states around Australia.

I can only re-emphasise that the Australian government want to ensure that we can provide this assistance to small and isolated communities around Australia. As I said, we have shown a willingness to change the guidelines. We are happy to consult with communities in relation to that and to talk to area consultative committees to see whether there are any ways we can further streamline that program and get the money out the door in a more timely sense so that we can continue to provide better services for regional communities.

It is very interesting that the Australian government seems to be having to pick up a lot more of the responsibilities that were traditionally local government and state government responsibilities. If the outrageous proposal by the Queensland government to amalgamate many of the local councils in Queensland actually goes ahead, that will put tremendous pressure on those communities. I have already made it very clear that we do not support the process which they are going through at the moment with the lack of consultation and the seven-member board that is going to basically draw some lines on maps which could, in many cases, wipe out the financial future of many of these towns. You talk about the Australian government supporting rural and regional towns. Without the councils, many of these towns, such as Barcaldine, where I recently attended a rally, those communities simply will not survive. It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition rushed up there not long ago and had a chat with the Premier and said, ‘I don’t think this is a good idea.’ His claim that if he was Prime Minister he could work closely with the states had its first big test. He basically got patted on the head and sent back to Canberra. He did not achieve anything at all.

They do not really have the interests of the regions at heart. All they are trying to do is play politics with this. We are doing the very best to ensure these programs are open and transparent, and are in fact delivering to the regions and the towns. It is very interesting that the Labor opposition have never supported Regional Partnerships. They have done everything to undermine it, bag it out and criticise it. If you go to virtually any town or community around Australia and ask them what they think of Regional Partnerships, they will tell you about the good work that it is doing.

I go back to that adage, ‘Look at what Labor does, not what it says.’

The widening of the southbound carriageway of the F5 to the M7 and Brooks Road, Ingleburn, of about five kilometres was completed and open to traffic in December 2005. It is a $23 million project fully funded by the Australian government and it was essential to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the M7-F5 interchange.

The total cost of this project is $30.1 million with the Australian government contributing 80 per cent or $24.1 million. It is expected the project will be completed by May 2008. You have the F5 ramps at Campbelltown Road, Ingleburn, and the project consists of a northbound exit ramp that connects with Campbelltown Road north of the Campbelltown Road overbridge at Ingleburn and a southbound entry ramp from a roundabout built at the intersection with

It was completed and opened on 16 June 2006. The total cost of this project was $13.7 million, with the Australian government contributing two-thirds or $9 million, and the Campbelltown council contributing the remaining third.

The minister will recall that just on Saturday he mentioned that he was concerned that childcare centres may increase their fees in response to the increase in the childcare benefit. The words he used were that he was not going to be a casual bystander. I just want to ask the minister a few questions in this area. It is a very important issue that I think all of us are concerned about. Has the minister actually received any information so far on childcare increases or, alternatively, has the minister actually received any information from childcare providers that they intend to put their fees up from 1 July, following the increase in childcare benefit?

Allegedly—I do not know what word you want to use—it has written to its families saying that it is intending to put up the fees by 10 per cent on 1 July and that it will be easier to absorb because the federal government has increased CCB by 10 per cent. So we are having a look at what centres are operating around there. We will be making it known whether that is in line with other people’s fees and ensuring that the public have adequate information. Maybe they are way below—I do not know. If they are, they might be just bringing themselves in line with others. But we will look at those sorts of issues as they arise and make the public aware of the choices that they have available. That is what I meant when I said that we are not going to be a passive bystander. There are practical things we can do in advising the public and informing ourselves of the genuine situation.

I made it known to them that you have to be able to justify in the arena of public opinion that these are reasonable childcare rises, that they can be substantiated and that they are not a way of simply taking advantage of the generosity of this measure.

There is no legal action or additional powers that the minister is seeking to use or have agreed to in order to take any additional action against these childcare centres?

But, first of all, I think we can have faith that the majority of centres will act appropriately. In the event that they do not then I am sure there will be a number of things that can potentially be done. This is but one, then over and above that you have associations that are also interested in protecting the public interest and ensuring that the issues of affordability are canvassed and understood, so that they do not bring into disrepute this very important industry also.

I am interested to know whether the census has been completed. I assume it has been completed, so I ask the minister if it could be released as soon as possible—assuming it has been completed. As a related issue, last night in the parliament the minister said that there is no shortage of child care for the zero to two age group. I wonder if the minister could confirm that that is the case and, if so, what his source for that information is. If the minister could release the childcare vacancies data for children under two years, that would be helpful.

The draft has not yet been completed and I do not have a date for receiving it—so I am advised. In relation to the second question, my comments were actually in direct response to allegations that you have made on air at different times with me. Each time that they have been raised we have checked on the areas surrounding the allegations and found them to be erroneous on every occasion.

That will help families; it will help the industry as well. At the moment I am going in and drilling in on a case-by-case basis when such information is provided by the public or allegations are made by the public or by Labor. The amount of work that went into propagating those maps which we provided to everyone for the six-month data is not a good use of time at the moment, given that in a very short time we are going to have the CCMS rolling out and that information will then be readily available on an ongoing basis and in a timely fashion. Remember that the information that I released earlier in the year in fact comprised the time lines from June to December last year. That was the best that was available. That was the only time it has ever been available, as you know, and time is now moving on, so we will be providing that information to the market as we get it once the CCMS is in.

In every case we have found it to be incorrect, as you know, and we have always reported that back to whoever has been on air. Quite often you get the situation where people are referring—‘people’ being constituents or the media—to long day care. They do not take into account the availability of zero to twos in family day care. We take into account all of those things when making comments about availability.

He did not make any provisos that this was just in the areas where allegations have been made. He was basically saying that there are no shortages anywhere in Australia. It is an extraordinary statement to make given that we have now discovered that he does not actually have data available for all of Australia; he only has data available for those areas where we have raised issues. Anyway, I will leave that where it stands.

I think I am quoting him correctly. In the estimate hearings recently, the department confirmed that the average payment being made is $813. I just want to confirm that all of these figures are correct. The minister might recall that just before the budget there was a banner headline in the News Ltd Sunday papers which said that people would be getting $8,000. Can the minister inform us how many families will in fact get $8,000?

The second one is that that does not take into account that under the current law people who do not have a large enough tax liability to offset it are clearly at zero. These people will be brought into the net when it becomes a Centrelink payment and of course constituents and families are not going to be required to keep their receipts. They will receive money, even though they do not necessarily have a tax liability or a big enough tax liability. So it will differ very much. It will be as little as a few dollars, depending on their out-of-pocket expenses and then 30 per cent thereof, if they use very little child care. But the expectation is that it will be in the order of $300 to $500. The advice that I have received is that that seems to be fairly normal. The $800 we have already dealt with and the $8,000 would be for a family for whom 30 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses is $4,000 and they have one child and that child has been in care for two years. I do not have the specific numbers with me, but of course if they have two children then it could quite feasibly be $16,000. Families have to remember that it is in fact per child per year and, because of the way we have now brought it forward, they will have the bonus of receiving those two payments, one when they put their tax in, any time after 1 July this year, and the other one commencing some time after September when it will start to roll out.

That would mean that very few people are making that sort of payment. About 70 per cent of the children in child care are in full time, so that would feed into the number of people who would be making those high levels of payment and then receiving $4,000. We will have a look at the numbers for you.

The minister would be aware that one of the initiatives that he has in this year’s budget, which we certainly support, is the change of CDEP positions to proper jobs, and that will include some childcare positions. Our concern is that the Bungala Aboriginal Corporation childcare centre is in danger of closing down because there has not been any guarantee that it will receive funding as part of the conversion of the CDEP jobs. Minister, can you guarantee that Bungala will get these conversions so that we can make sure that the childcare centre does not close?

When unemployment is under seven per cent in an area, CDEP changes. I am advised that the organisation auspicing the child care no longer wish to continue with that, and they will obviously involve the CDEP. We have offered them other support—in other words, to replace the cross-subsidisation that CDEP was providing. I am unaware as to whether or not they are fully intending to continue that at this point. My adviser tells me that they are not intending to do so at this stage. If that is the case then we will look at it further. There are obviously always opportunities for other organisations to auspice such services. It is not an unusual circumstance in remote or in regional communities to have to find other suppliers. It is something the department is working on at the moment with the local organisation.

It is the principles behind those forms that we have discussed with them; but, ultimately, it will be a decision for the NAC, with industry, to ensure that they are appropriate. I looked at 100 forms that had been completed, and I was extremely unhappy. I actually went and got a cross-section of the spot check forms and had a look at them to satisfy myself as to whether or not they were meeting what we were after. I think, as you would agree, Member for Jagajaga, if you go into a childcare centre you know pretty quickly whether or not it is a good environment, a healthy environment et cetera. What we are trying to achieve with the spot checks is to pick up anything that is grossly inadequate so that it can be dealt with immediately. We want to pick up things which should be dealt with. They may actually be a state responsibility. Sometimes when people are in the organisation, they may see things that are in fact part of the NAC’s responsibility.

I described to one of those conferences an example given of a form that had been completed by a spot checker. Because the certificate was not in the appropriate place, in a footnote they wrote, ‘The certificate was not in the appropriate place because the building was being painted and the certificate was on the floor.’ It is an extraordinary story. And then it said, ‘Please explain within eight weeks’—or whatever else—‘why it was not so.’ And you say to yourself, ‘This is barmy.’ So what we want it to do is actually address the needs of the parents and our needs as legislators to ensure that the environment is as it should be, that it is meeting the requirements of the NAC and that we are not just creating paperwork for the sake of paperwork. They were the principles behind it, and the paperwork will be out there within the next couple of weeks.

In fact, he said specifically that matters of hygiene are not the role of the accreditation council and then went on to talk about redoing the spot check form. We would certainly be very concerned if matters of hygiene were not matters pursued in spot checks. We do think that these are very serious matters. Hygiene is a critical issue when small children are congregated together. I just want to know from the minister that the spot check forms are not going to exclude these matters. Yes, in some part they are the responsibility of state governments, but clearly they should nevertheless be part of a spot check.

If it is a minor matter, a minor infringement—and, again, it might be just by way of advice—that is the sort of thing that should not be done. If it is a major issue then it is for the state health authorities to deal with. Our spot checkers are required to immediately inform their state counterparts and have them act upon that, who have the authority to do so.

Have them responsible for it, notify them of it and have them follow through on it, but deal with any hygiene issues that we have just mentioned immediately—as long as they are inadvertent and not wanton disregard for the health and wellbeing of their centre and their children.

There are two things. We were not prepared to spend money in the same form that it was being spent previously and in doing so repeat the mistakes of the past. Hence, when that money was not able to be expended in a way that could be sustainable, I took the decision—and there was a plethora of issues around that dealing with states and territories et cetera that fed into that decision—that we would apply for that to be rephased through Finance. I have every confidence that that will be done and that money will be applied to this year. It is a standard practice. It happens across all departments. It happens across all governments, and there is no reason to suggest that that money will be lost to Indigenous affairs.

There has been nothing even remotely like it. Of course that $60 million will come into this new year. As of today, we are finalising details of major housing developments in a number of remote communities—and certainly in those communities the likes have never been seen—to occur in this dry season. As you would appreciate, the wet and the dry have a big implication as to (a) cost and (b) your capacity to deliver.

As I understand it, the houses are in very poor condition. If you could let us know when that will happensioner, that would be very helpful.

On another related issue, the minister has been very keen to see homes built on the outstations from Wadeye and particularly to pursue home ownership in this community. I am keen to find out how much it has actually cost to build the four homes in Wudapuli and Nama, and I would appreciate it if the minister could let us know how much those four homes cost.

It is not my desire; it is theirs. My job is to try and help facilitate that. Yes, four houses have been built there. I know this question was asked in Senate estimates. My understanding is that the cost for some of those houses has not yet been fully determined because they are in dispute with one of the builders or one of the suppliers, I am not sure which. The associate secretary of my department, Mr Wayne Gibbons, I think gave such advice and has taken that question on notice from your colleague in the Senate and no doubt will make that information available as soon as he can.

First of all, I want to know whether the minister is still hopeful of getting a resolution to this issue. Obviously, we are all aware of the circumstances the people live in in the Tangentyere Council and the town camps. I think it is a shared objective that we see those homes and the infrastructure upgraded. I would certainly like to know whether the minister is continuing to discuss these issues and, if so, what the program is for resolving them. I did have the impression that he was still keen to get a resolution to this very important housing problem.

I know that she was as upset as I was that she was unable to persuade the membership of the Tangentyere Council to see sense in this matter. The Chief Minister and her Minister for Housing, Mr McAdam, and perhaps others, are continuing to pursue the matter. As we said in the main chamber today, the town camps are in fact under special purpose leases and they are the full jurisdictional responsibility of the Territory government. But I acknowledge that (a) this is a human suffering of an extraordinary degree, (b) it is totally unnecessary and (c) the Territory government, I do not believe, would have the resources to be able to do this. Hence, we are putting that money there. I have made it very clear, though, that I think it is unacceptable to put that money there and have it managed by the same organisation that has overseen the management of the houses, seeing the state they are in, when they receive municipal funding from the federal government to maintain those places.

Clearly it would be unacceptable in any other part of the country if your local council, which is responsible for your municipal services, was to provide them in such an inadequate way as to cause harm to its locals. I am asking for an independent report. I asked for that today—just to let you know—to find out what the standards are and what the state of such services is, considering that at the moment I believe the Commonwealth pays to Tangentyere $1.3-something million per year to undertake its municipal services; but it is not the only one. So I want all of those communities looked at because it is part of our overall package of trying to normalise services and increase and improve the services.

That in fact is totally incorrect. We made an offer of $30 million which was going to upgrade the town camps to what I subsequently learnt would be a second-grade standard. We were utilising Connecting Neighbours money, and I learnt that that would mean you would have a cul-de-sac—called Abbott’s Camp, for argument’s sake—literally in the heart of Alice Springs. Its municipal services, its power and water supply, would not be as underground as far as they were down the road, which, of course, raises other issues. If any of us are serious about ensuring that we treat everyone equally, you do not have a second-class system for Indigenous people. Hence the further injection of funds—and you can see the magnitude of it—to be able to achieve an equitable level of service provision for all of those town camps, as is required everywhere else in Alice Springs. That allows for everything else to flow from it, including appropriate public housing and public housing tenant arrangements.

So that should not have been an impediment to a decision-making process; it should have actually sped it up. In relation to the second question, it is just a question that you would have to put to the people of Tangentyere. You get very conflicting advice back from different parts of the organisation and different individuals, so I would be simply speculating on the real reasons that underlie that decision.

They were sure that a deal had been entered into, or was going to be, and that the majority of people agreed and then at the last minute it did not happen. We will wait and see what occurs and whether the Territory government can do it—at the end of the day, this is not the Commonwealth doing it; it is the Territory government, but we are providing the funds. They have as much interest as we do in trying to get an outcome on this, so I hope that they can overcome whatever objections are there. I left it open to the

I think that is part of my duty: to be able to leverage other state governments and territory governments to put more into this particular area, with real reform. That is one avenue that is being explored. Another avenue that is being explored is in the Territory. We have had favourable responses from communities that wish to participate in trying to improve their lot, and we will continue to have discussions with them. I will not make those communities known publicly at this point until such time as they wish that to happen; I think that is reasonable.

I cannot guarantee $60 million, because that means I will sit on my hands with that money, on a hope and a prayer that one day someone will see sense about what needs to occur. If that is never to happen, we would probably be back here next year—if you were in that place and I was in this—with you asking: ‘Are you rolling over money again? Why haven’t you expended this money when it has been sitting there and there are other needy communities?’ So that is a judgement call that I as the minister have made.

I know that the member for Sydney is here, so we will move on to the Human Services area. Before I do that, in relation to another area of the minister’s responsibilities, disability funding, I am obviously aware of the negotiations which have been taking place—or not taking place, as may be the case—with the states and territories. Could the minister let me know what funding has been provided in the interim agreement? I understand an interim agreement has been entered into up until the end of this year. Is that correct?

I wrote to all states and territories earlier this month and confirmed for them that the Commonwealth will continue to fund the Commonwealth/State-Territory Disability Agreement at its current rate, including indexation, up to—I say ‘up to’ and not ‘until’—31 December. Hopefully there will be a multilateral agreement before then so that the new agreement can come into place. In the event that negotiations stop altogether, then obviously that is there. That is the interim measure that has been put into place: continuation of the same level of funding, including indexation, through to the end of this calendar year.

None of them undertook to put that into their budgets. I think that is a crying shame. However, I asked them in that letter dated 8 May to come back to me as soon as practicable with a detailed and complete breakdown of what they intend to fund, how they intend to fund it and what funding they require from the Commonwealth government. So I await their advice.

It was not really clear from the minister’s proposal what his intentions are in this area. I think he said something like it was possible that there would be no legislation introduced at all this year. I would like the acting minister to tell us what will happen to the $1.1 billion that has been allocated over the forward estimates for the access card. What is going to happen if there is no legislation introduced this year? Can you tell us what effect that has on the spending proposed for the access card?

There are two things. The minister, Senator Ellison, last week announced that an exposure draft of the access card bill would be released for public comment during the June 2007 winter sitting period and that has not changed. Australians will be able to comment on the proposed access card bill during the consultation period. He sees it as a very positive opportunity to consult more widely. He will be announcing details of the consultation arrangements once the exposure draft is released. In relation to the budget money, it is there and the government is still intending to do it, so it is an allocation against that expenditure. I think that should answer your question.

These tenders have now closed and have been evaluated by the department. I am advised that the department met with the tenderers today to reassure them of the process and to take any advice et cetera from them so they know where it is going.

Of course, it is the prerogative of any incoming government to change that, if there is no contract in place—obviously if there are contracts in place then there are issues of contract and, obviously, liability if someone’s contracts are torn up. But that is the prerogative of an incoming government, so I could not comment on that.

But I would say to you that, if there are any issues around their capacity to tender for other business, that is something they can take up directly with the department. This is a very large project—$1.1 billion—and probity is very important. Of course, you would not want to compromise that and have it dragged through the courts inappropriately, through inadvertently providing information or doing something outside of that. So I am sure that they are following all the due processes in making sure that this particular process is protected, in the interests of all Australian taxpayers.

Like anything, if you have delays you have the potential, but that is all it is at this stage—the potential for there to be an increase. Like anything, it has the potential to increase. On the other hand, you might find that technologies improve as well, so I could not say categorically. All the budget papers are are a breakdown in your expected costs and your expected expenditure in running departments and running programs et cetera. So that is what we have budgeted for at this stage, and no doubt there will be contingencies within the budget portfolios for various matters. I will just see if I have anything else for you—about 80 per cent of the cost is for the access card, $480 million out of about $580 million.

If, for argument’s sake, it is without sewerage et cetera, a house is inhabitable for 48 hours. So 48 hours stands—14 days is what was applied apparently in Far North Queensland. I think it is inappropriate, given the conditions down here, and we have said if that is the only issue it is seven days. But if there are a multitude of things which would make a house uninhabitable then clearly it needs to be shorter periods of time, and that is where the 48 hours apply. That is what we are asking Centrelink to be mindful of.

We are in winter in southern Australia and other issues are obviously pertinent here.’ Having lived in Singleton, I am only too well aware of the weather at this time of year.

What happens where there is an electricity issue, where there is an issue of being without water for a day and where there is an issue of sewage filling the yards? The person may have been away from their home only for a short period, but they are in a situation where they have lost freezers full of food and they have had washing machines and breadmakers blow up because of the flooding. Because of the sewage and the lack of electricity they have lost washing machines, refrigerators and cars, and some of these people are not insured. I would be interested in any comment you might like to make in relation to the seven-day rule and in relation to my constituents.

It is not just the one-off; it is like a menu. Those things can add up to uninhabitability.

The minister would be aware that Centrelink normally processes all real estate reviews to make sure that people who are entitled to the pension have a proper pension assets test assessment. As I understand it, Centrelink seems to have stopped its real estate review schedule for 2007. Could the minister confirm whether that is the case? Could he also let me know how many reviews have already occurred this year and, if they have stopped, why they have stopped?

I also wrote to Minister Ellison with respect to this matter and about a month ago I received a letter from the minister indicating that there was some electronic software that was useful—and I do not deny that that would be of some use to my constituents. He went on to say in a part of his letter: ‘The electronic Medicare initiative means establishing a Medicare office in Watergardens shopping centre’—which is the largest commercial area of the electorate—‘or in the electorate of Gorton would not be necessary. The new initiative would also mean no queues for claiming rebates.’

And, as I said, I was wondering if the minister could investigate why there wouldn’t be reason for a Medicare office to be in such a fast-growing electorate?

This is something we have been pursuing for some time and it is being rolled out from later this year. It is electronically done in the surgery. I presume your electorate is like mine, where some doctors require everyone to pay up-front and then go to the Medicare office; others take part of the payment and get the rest later. This software will mean that those claims can be processed right there and then electronically, and it will roll out. If we did not have that, I would fully support your request to have a Medicare office, but I think your constituents will find—presuming that that starts to come into play later this year in your electorate and, if not, certainly early next year, well before we could actually get a Medicare office locked in—that their needs will be more than adequately met. In fact, a superior service is what it turns out to be, and it is because the doctor’s surgeries are now working with the Commonwealth to make this a reality.

Indeed, there is currently consideration as to how parents would be eligible for the payment. As I understand it, the payment is an interim ex gratia payment that the government is offering while a wide-ranging review is underway, and the review is examining eligibility for carer payments and the payments affected in providing a safety net for carers of children with a severe disability. There was a very positive story—and I am happy to say it was a positive story—about a difficult situation for parents who are looking after their four-year-old child who is quite severely disabled and is indeed eligible for this payment.

It indicated that the Prime Minister announced that Tyler Fishlock, who is the young lad who is a cancer survivor, was a recipient of the payment. I have had a series of constituents contact my office who find themselves in a very similar position to that of the Fishlock family. Firstly, I was wondering how long the review will go. Some of these families have contacted the department by way of phone, but they are not sure whether they would be eligible or not. Because the matter is under review they do not know whether they will ever be eligible. But so far it has been very difficult to explain why their position is so distinctly different from that very difficult case for the Fishlock family. I was wondering whether the minister could comment on how the review is going and whether I can give some certainty to the families who are in what I would argue is a similar situation.

What the money is for is an adjustment, and it is for children under the age of six. It is carer payment (child). There are two separate issues to be clear on. One is the review, which has nothing to do directly per se with the ex gratia payments. It is a review that had already been announced. It will run through this year and report either late this year or early next year. This is not the first time we have done it in government, and no doubt subsequent governments will do this as well. Clearly every baby is totally dependent upon their parents or their carers; hence you have that difficult circumstance where for someone with a disability there is no more or less care at that early age. Quite often you have genetic issues which do not manifest themselves for a couple of years.

We now have the documentation out. It should have gone out on 8 June for anyone who had already lodged. So, if your constituents contact Centrelink, they should not bother themselves with whether or not they are eligible; they should fill out that application and put it in. There is an independent body that is evaluating every case. It is up to $10,000, it is for children aged under six and it is an adjustment package.

It is fantastic that he is alive—in fact, when I rang his home he answered the phone! That is a good thing. But there is a big adjustment for a family and this money is aimed at trying to assist people during that adjustment. It is up to $10,000, so we will not make judgements here; we will ask people to do that. Where this interplays with the longer review is that, when the review is complete, the interim payment will be re-evaluated at that point as to whether it should go forward or not. This is an interim to fill in until that work has been completed. I hope that helps, but they should contact Centrelink; the documents are now available.

I do not know if the minister is aware of recent reports about people with profound disabilities who have no prospect of getting better or being able to work being asked to fill in certain forms through Centrelink. We have had certain issues in my electorate, where constituents who have profound disabilities have been coming to see us. Their disabilities are such that they will never, ever get better—they were born with these disabilities—yet they were given such a torrid time through Centrelink in terms of completing forms, being asked for doctors’ reports and continuously being asked to fill in more and more forms.

Centrelink had all the information—all the medical records—yet the parents were asked to produce every bit of medical record that existed on this child from the day they were born. They were so frustrated with their dealings with Centrelink. Centrelink basically said to them: ‘Look, we can’t change this. This is what’s required. If you want this changed, it’s a legislative matter so go and see your MP.’ They came to see me and I got on to the minister’s office. I must put on the record that Minister Ellison’s office was very helpful and fixed the issue immediately. Within 24 hours it was sorted. The minister’s office told me that this should not have been the case—that, in this particular case, it could have been fast-tracked and it could have been fixed.

If that was a one-off case, I would be ambivalent about it, but I have another seven cases here exactly the same, where they have been told to come and see their MP. All of them are in the same sort of situation. It is someone with a profound disability that is never going to get better, yet, again, Centrelink are asking for records that they already have. The question I am asking is: how many times will people with profound disabilities who will never get better—and we are aware of it—be asked to fill in forms and constantly be asked for records? If the case is that they do not have to, why are we getting people in the electorate office being sent to us by Centrelink, telling them that they have exhausted all avenues and need to speak to their MP?

I would like to see the seven so that we can take them up and find out if there is a systemic issue in an office or whether it is broader. If it is, then we would bring that to Senator Ellison’s attention to deal with. As you said, his staff are very professional and are trying to deal with these sorts of issues. When you are dealing with 600,000-odd people with disability pensions these days, things can and often do go awry. You do have to be aware that we are trying to protect the public purse but to do it in such a way as to be sensitive. Sometimes that balance, as you have indicated—and luckily Senator Ellison’s office was able to fix it—is not always where it should be. We would always take those issues up. If they are more systemic, we will see what we can do to deal with them.

It was reported in one of the papers that it will take effect when it is passed through the Greek parliament. I suppose the question I have is: what happens if it does not get passed through the Greek parliament? Secondly, what will be Centrelink’s requirements of Australian citizens who left perhaps many years ago and who have absolutely no records? Some of them left the country after World War

Will there be any requirements upon them to prove that there are no entitlements that they can get, and where do they get this information when there is no record of them even existing in Greece many years ago?

Since I was the minister who signed it, I will take full responsibility! I wish that were true. It has been great that they have got to this agreement. There are still a range of things that have to be gone through—ratification et cetera. I think 1 January 2009 is the date for its introduction. I will get the officials to give you a full run-down on how it applies to people before and after returning both ways. The very real issue that you raise about displaced people not having papers is an ongoing one, and we would have to be sensitive to that. I do not know the answer as to how you can physically address someone’s issues if there is no way of assuring yourself that what they are saying is in fact accurate. But let us have a look at that and come back to you. We have a little time to work on it and to try to get some proper answers.

I am slightly astonished with this arrangement. I am happy that members from the bureaucracy are here, but I find it extraordinary that the minister is not. Any contribution that we make from this side of the Committee in this area, I think, should be heard by the minister, with the greatest of respect. I want to put on record my astonishment that the minister may not be prepared to be here for this debate.

The previous minister of course has left—that is blatantly obvious. The list of speakers from the opposition has been exhausted. I have no choice but to shut down the Main Committee in the absence of the minister. So I believe that the department would be very happy to take details of speeches from the opposition speakers, and the minister will answer all of those questions in the summing-up at the expiry of time for this debate.

I just want to make the point, without labouring it too much, that in this particular part of the debate on appropriations it is most appropriate for members of the opposition to be able to not only debate them but ask questions of the minister and then respond to those answers. It is very difficult to do that when the minister is not here. We respect the fact that he is not here, but it does not help open debate, which is what we have just had with the previous minister.

There were 12 recommendations in all, but they included, perhaps most importantly, a recommendation for the provision of additional funding to smooth the transition and a series of options for ensuring that they had access to the digital spectrum as soon as possible to allow them to simulcast. In all of the submissions that we received from community television there was a recurring theme, which was that, as members of the general public—members of their audience—transferred from analog to digital in their homes, they lost access to the signal from the community television station. So what was obviously happening and what will continue to happen is that, as people move from analog to digital, community television effectively loses its market. The view was that the situation is now so dire that, unless access to spectrum is granted within a very short time frame, community television will effectively cease to exist.

The time for applying has closed and officers for Digital Australia are now being considered. Digital Australia will be located in Sydney. Its establishment is well underway. Digital Australia will educate Australians on the benefits of digital television in order to accelerate take-up and inform consumers about the need and the ways to convert to digital transmission as switchover approaches.

Consequently, Digital Australia will consider all of the issues surrounding the diverse interests of the industry in the switchover process, including broadcasters, receiver importers, antenna installers, retailers—all will be called upon to participate.

If so, how much money remains unspent or uncommitted? Can the minister please indicate whether any unspent amounts will lapse at the end of the financial year or be reallocated across the forward estimates? Why is it that these underspends have occurred?

I think we are splitting hairs here. He did ask me about an underspend, and I am sure if I trawl through the minutiae of the budget papers in all of their extensiveness then I probably could come upon it. I simply do not have the capacity to do so, but I will ensure that somebody goes to the trouble and effort that the member for Grayndler requires. What I can say about the Australian Broadband Guarantee and the establishment of the broadband black spot program is that $30.1 million will be provided in 2006-07 and $112.4 million in 2007-08 to provide subsidised internet access for Australians currently unable to gain a metropolitan comparable level of broadband service at their principal place of residence or small business.

Can the minister confirm the value of subsidies for satellite and wireless broadband in rural and regional Australia? Has analysis been undertaken to assess the cost of investing in fibre infrastructure to deliver true parity of service to rural areas? What is the difference in cost between providing fibre, satellite and wireless broadband infrastructure to rural areas? If a fibre-to-the-node network is able to provide broadband speeds 50 times greater than wireless networks in rural and regional Australia, does the minister believe this constitutes parity of service?

The producer rebate will provide a tax rebate of 40 per cent of eligible Australian expenditure to producers of qualifying feature films and a 20 per cent rebate for other eligible formats, principally television. Then there is the improved location rebate, which increases the existing rebate from 12½ per cent to 15 per cent, and of course we have established the new Australian Screen Authority. As far as I am concerned the government, on behalf of its taxpayers, is doing its job and it is about time filmmakers did their job and made films Australians want to see. I have waited a long time to say that. I feel better and I will say more.

They have alleged, not to the total conviction of some of us in the government, that their failures over the past few years have been because of financial disincentives and constraints. There are some of us who think that the real problem is in the storytelling. But be that as it may, we are about to find out, because the government has funding now in place for which there are no excuses for Australian filmmakers to hide behind. I am not in the habit of making commitments on behalf of ministers without their express authority. What I do know is that the spirit of the government’s injection of tens of millions of new dollars for the film and television industries would see us maintaining support across the board.

That is how it should be, given that this is a package of $283 million. It is a complete overhaul of film funding. It introduces a genuine incentive for producers to attract strong investor interest and puts the industry on a more sustainable footing. I believe the government is entirely right—given the injection of $283 million to maintain funding for the next financial year and consider issues from then.

Minister, given that this budget did neglect the urgent challenges facing the Indigenous arts and crafts sector and that the previous budgets rejected a resale royalty scheme, can you provide us with the evidence which would substantiate the government’s claim that a resale royalty scheme ‘would not provide a meaningful source of income for the majority of Australian artists’? And there I am quoting Senator Kemp from 9 May 2006.

I think the case for a resale royalty scheme is much stronger for Indigenous artists, who during their own lifetime are not rewarded for the on-selling of their work. It may be that Senator Kemp was referring more to long-departed artists—and it would be their estates that benefited because it seems that, apart from a handful of very distinguished living artists, most are rewarded, in monetary terms, for their work after they have departed for that great art studio in the sky.

It has always been argued by many who are sincere and knowledgeable in the area that it would be a disincentive to purchasing young artists’ work, knowing that when you sell it, if it comes to that, you will lose a percentage of the sale. The studies of the French system are not clear-cut.

At the moment in Australia we do not really have a great deal of experience to draw upon. We are looking overseas to other countries’ schemes. We have seen a handful of artists’ estates benefit. But the government is very sympathetic to the position of Indigenous artists, who are suffering the frauds and deceptions that the honourable member refers to.

I refer also to the number of questions placed at estimates concerning additional information about the Australian Business Arts Foundation. In this instance, the funding for the program was 2006-07 and, clearly, it will come to an end this month. My question for the minister is: will ABAF continue to deliver the package to boost private sector support for the arts and add resources to the visual arts sector? If not, will the government ensure an open and transparent tender process?

So the government is not looking to penny-pinch on support for the arts broadly, as evidenced by the massive investment in the arts budgets now.

You have to be a little careful in the arts, I suppose, as in any area of government administration. A grant for a set period of time can often achieve its objective, and the fact that a government has approved it once should not be a guarantee that it continues in perpetuity, particularly if there are other priorities or pressing needs that that money could then address. I do not know the particulars of the need for the $1.1 million to ABAF for the private sector involvement with the visual arts. It may have done its job or it may be partly completed and need continuation in one form or another, but I do not think it should be a God-given right for any constituency that a time-limited program continues for ever more.

During budget Senate estimates last month, a departmental official confirmed that (a) the number of applications for Playing Australia grants was about on par with the previous round, (b) the Playing Australia committee’s assessment process had been completed and (c) the minister had received the committee’s assessment. However, we note the Minister for the Arts and Sport failed to announce the successful applicants within the month of April, as his website states would normally occur. Minister, on what date did the minister for the arts receive the Playing Australia committee’s recommendations for the previous round of grants and what is the full explanation for the delay in announcing successful applicants?

I think I am safe in saying that in the May 2006 budget we took it from $2½ million or $3 million—do not hold me to the exactness of these figures—to about $4 million. It was a very substantial increase. It was in recognition of the success of the program. Playing Australia is acclaimed by regional and rural audiences across our nation. The government is a strong supporter of Playing Australia. I have no doubt there are good and proper reasons why the minister is still considering the recommendations of the Playing Australia committee. Bear in mind that they are recommendations—and do not read anything into this because I do not know the particulars of the issue the member is raising—and a minister does not blindly accept a recommendation and rubber stamp it. We cannot delegate completely our responsibilities. We can delegate the gathering of information and the sourcing of advice, but a minister has to carefully consider issues and stand by his or her own judgement. There is nothing unusual about a minister wanting to carefully consider recommendations from an advisory body.

Channel B can be used for a wider range of services, potentially including mobile and television services. Neither channel will be permitted to be used for traditional commercial television or in-home subscription broadcasting services because we believe that these channels should be used to offer new and innovative digital services to consumers.

I do appreciate that it is six minutes earlier than anticipated but, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will attempt to provide the context in which the questioning will occur. Obviously, the appropriations section of the budget on education is of particular significance and interest to those of us on this side of the House as, indeed, I am sure it is to all of us in this place. There will be a range of specific questioning, and the opposition will be interested in the more detailed information from the minister as we go through the procedure.

Clearly, the higher education sector and the two aspects of full fee courses and the Higher Education Endowment Fund, the way in which the monetary allocations have been made and how they will then be implemented are of particular interest to us.

The Higher Education Endowment Fund is indeed significant. It has long-lasting implications for the university sector. There are some specific and important questions that need to be addressed in terms of that fund, being one of the major announcements and indeed highlighted so significantly by the Treasurer in his budget speech. It outlines to us the need to get some further detail on what exactly that fund will be composed of, how it will be administered, what sort of ongoing funding it generates and how universities will be able to access that funding. It would be no surprise, I am sure, to the chamber that there is quite a range of funding detail in terms of the Higher Education Endowment Fund that we would like the opportunity to explore with the minister when she arrives.

As the member would be aware, that cap was 35 per cent in most subjects and 25 per cent in medicine, and that has been lifted. But the fact is that about three per cent of full-fee-paying undergraduate domestic places are currently in existence. So we do not have any anticipation that that will increase dramatically. The cap was essentially lifted because it was an unnecessary piece of bureaucracy that did not need to be there.

The way we will be able to do that is through the three-year funding agreements that are also a budget initiative from this year. Universities will be required to offer all Commonwealth-supported places, and we will not allow them to manipulate those places so as to create full-fee-paying courses.

Isn’t the government’s decision to lift the full-fee cap just going to further increase that number?

That three per cent also includes people who undertake winter courses and summer courses, as they are called. So the number of people in full-time domestic undergraduate places would be less than three per cent, and we do not anticipate that lifting the cap will make a significant difference to that number.

Can the minister confirm that the government is cutting funding per Commonwealth supported student place in those disciplines by $1,029 per year? Isn’t that just shifting the cost of higher education further onto students?

It was an extra $557 million over four years for specific courses. Specifically, the Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding will deliver increases in 2008 for maths and science by $2,729 per place; for allied health by $1,889 per place; for engineering, science and surveying by $684 per place; for clinical psychology by $2,729 per place; for education by $109 per place; for nursing by $109 per place; for behavioural science and social studies by $840 per place; and for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science by $1,081 per place. It is up to the universities as to how they distribute funds across all discipline clusters.

On the one side, there is the amount that the universities receive under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme and, on the other side, there is the amount that a university can charge a student under the Commonwealth supported place arrangement, the loan assistance scheme. In the case of accounting, administration, economics and commerce, we aligned the Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding with that of law. That means that universities are able to align those courses with law for student contributions if they so wish. The point that I am making is that, given that the universities will be receiving an extra $557 million in additional funding under this initiative and they can distribute the funds across all discipline clusters, I anticipate that some universities will take the opportunity to leave—we will call it

As to whether or not only one university chose not to raise its HECS fees, I cannot comment on that. I would obviously have to check the records as to which universities did or did not. The point about the student contribution loan scheme is that students in accounting, administration, economics and commerce degrees have the opportunity to earn considerable lifetime earnings as graduates from those courses, akin to law students. The government believes that it is fair for students to contribute to the cost of their education, particularly in courses where the opportunity to earn significantly greater salaries over their lifetime than a person who has not had the opportunity to go to university is taken into account. I think it is appropriate that accounting, administration, economics and commerce graduates are treated in a similar fashion to law graduates.

As I said, the changes will only affect students who commence studying at higher education providers after 1 January 2008. There is a transition fund to compensate universities for students who continue under the existing arrangements. In four years time, when the transition fund is no longer applicable, all students will be operating under the same conditions. As I say, the higher salaries that graduates of accounting, administration, economics and commerce receive over their lifetime and the competitive nature of the labour market for these skills made it appropriate to align both the capital grants scheme and the student contribution level with that of law.

My point is this: we have created the Higher Education Endowment Fund with $5 billion from this year’s surplus. My point that the Labor Party could only dream of creating such an endowment fund refers to the fact that the Labor Party operated budget deficits—and you cannot create an endowment fund out of a budget surplus if you operate budget deficits.

It will be invested. The dividends over time will then be distributed to universities—we anticipate on an annual basis. As the budget papers show, we have already anticipated that $304 million is an estimate of the funds that would be available to distribute over the three years from 2008. That would mean an extra $912 million. That is in addition to the funding that exists under the Capital Development Pool program. The Capital Development Pool program currently exists to provide funding for new universities and for regional universities, and the guidelines are quite specific. The point I made is that over time, as the Treasurer has indicated, the Australian government will continue to put budget surpluses into the Higher Education Endowment Fund so that that capital base increases. It will be a perpetual growth fund for our universities. Therefore, as that increases—and, presumably, the guardians of the

The larger the capital fund, the larger the dividend.

What I was suggesting was that, over time, it might be possible to roll some of the funds into the Higher Education Endowment Fund—so not decrease funding but actually increase the pool that is invested for distribution. But that is a matter that we would look at down the track. For example, this year we announced the new Diversity and Structural Adjustment Fund. What that fund will do is absorb the previous Collaboration and Structural Reform Fund. I am keen to streamline the opportunities for universities to apply for funding so that they do not have to apply for too many different programs but rather have the opportunity to apply under broader programs with broader guidelines. So the two statements are entirely consistent and are certainly not mutually exclusive.

I am suggesting that, over time, consideration could be given—depending upon what the guidelines are for the Higher Education Endowment Fund—to merging the two funds. It might not be appropriate.

Would they be subsumed into the Higher Education Endowment Fund and how would that happen? Would it mean that those other programs would be abolished and, if so, which programs? How much are those programs worth currently? How much are they worth annually, separately and as a total? What would that mean for the total amount available annually to universities for capital and research infrastructure? Can the minister say categorically that the amount available will increase by $300 million per year? If not, what does it mean for universities?

I mean, let us get real. We have just announced a budget of an additional $1.7 billion in funding for universities plus the creation of a $5 billion endowment fund. The point I was making was that universities currently access a range of programs and one of them is for capital, specifically the Capital Development Pool program. I have no intention of reducing the capital that is available to universities. My point was merely of an administrative nature as to what would be easier for our universities to access and how that could be done in a more streamlined fashion. I will certainly take advice from the Higher Education Endowment Fund on the guidelines that they suggest should exist in relation to the application of dividends from that fund. The Higher Education Endowment Fund is expected to provide a dividend of over $900 million over the next three years. That is set out in the budget papers. In fact I think it is specifically $912 million. That is our expectation.

In fact, the Higher Education Endowment Fund will be an opportunity for universities to access dividends from a capital fund the size of which has not been seen in the higher education sector in this country. The whole idea of the Higher Education Endowment Fund is to enable universities to apply—whatever the persuasion of the government and whatever the government’s particular higher education policy is at the time—to an established perpetual growth fund for access to the dividends from that fund. Now, we expect that this fund will be supported by the opposition—that its creation, its establishment and the legislation surrounding it will be supported by the opposition—so that, whatever the policy of the government of the day on higher education and the funding of higher education, our universities will have access to a perpetual growth fund.

We are seeking to establish a committee that will draft guidelines to advise us on the appropriate application of the dividends from the Higher Education Endowment Fund.

Our higher education institutions have not been as successful as their competitors overseas in attracting philanthropic donations. In fact, in Australian universities, less than two per cent of their income, their revenue, comes from philanthropic donations, whereas in comparable universities overseas it can be as high as 15 or 20 per cent. Our universities are obviously reliant on federal government funding, and that will continue, but there are additional avenues of funding from business, industry, alumni and state and territory governments that should be explored.

If a state government were approached by a university for the establishment of, say, a dental school or a medical school and it said to that state government, ‘If you commit $5 million’—let us just use a hypothetical example—‘for the establishment of a medical school at this university in your state, which will help us to produce medical graduates for employment in this state, we can then go to the federal government endowment fund and say we have a commitment from the state government and we can then seek to access the Higher Education Endowment Fund.’ But at no time have I or the department ever suggested that it would be a precondition of accessing the education endowment fund that they have matching funds. In fact, we specifically say that we would take that into account, but it is not a prerequisite—nor do I expect the advisory committee to suggest that be the case, because that is not what the government intends. So it would be naive not to look at the opportunities that exist for leveraging the existence of the Higher Education Endowment Fund from state governments, business, industry and alumni.

I was asked a question about the capital development pool and I wanted to get some more details on that. The capital development pool figures in the 2007-08 budget for the forward years total $298.464 million. In 2007-08 that will be $80.092 million; in 2008-09, $71.425 million; in 2009-10, $72.782 million; and in 2010-2011, $74.165 million. So the commitment for the capital development pool through to 2010-2011 is $298.464 million and there is no government decision nor do we intend to roll that into the Higher Education Endowment Fund.

I refer to the minister’s announcement that performance pay for teachers will be a condition of the 2009-12 quadrennium schools funding agreement. I also refer to the minister’s statement that the next 2009-12 quadrennium schools funding agreement will have $42 billion in funding available to schools. Given that the minister has revealed these details, when will she provide schools with certainty about how much money they will have in the next funding agreement?

The expectation is that the figure will be around $42 billion, but that will obviously take into account a range of issues, including enrolments and the indexation figures. But I have given an indication of what I believe will be the likely figure for the 2009 funding quadrennium, which will take effect from 1 January 2009. We anticipate it to be around that figure.

The Reading Assistance Voucher program was very successful. The member might be referring to the first year that we conducted a pilot. That relied upon the cooperation of the state and territory governments to provide to the Australian government the details of the parents who would be eligible for that voucher because their students, who were then in year 3, had not met the minimum standards for literacy in that year. The states that did cooperate and provide the information so that parents were given timely notice of the offer of the voucher had a significant take-up rate. The feedback that we have had from the evaluation was that it was highly successful in those states. There were a couple of states which did not cooperate with the federal government because they did not inform the parents in a timely way or at all and in those states there was a lower take-up because the parents had not been informed of their eligibility. The Australian government offered to roll the pilot over to enable those parents in those states to take up the offer and there has been a considerable degree of take-up.

There has been significant take-up—I believe 13,000 people have registered for the voucher scheme that is in existence for 2006. Based on the success, the interest and the evaluation of the previous programs, we have considered the steps that the Australian government can take.

We anticipate that, as a result of these tests, there will be a number of students identified in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 who do not meet the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy. We are not prepared to stand by and let those students who do not meet minimum standards suffer as a result of not being able to access appropriate support in literacy and numeracy. Therefore, we announced a national tuition scheme whereby we will provide a tuition voucher of $700 to those parents whose children have failed to meet the minimum standards in the national tests in literacy and numeracy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The interest in this voucher scheme is very high. There are many people who are concerned—and schools are also concerned—about, if their children do not meet the national tests, what support will be in place for them. So it is a safety net, if you like, to ensure that students who do not meet these minimum standards are provided with the opportunity to improve their skills. And, as the federal education minister, I cannot stand by and let students who essentially fail the national test not receive support to give them the opportunity to improve their ability in literacy and numeracy. The $700 voucher will be provided to those parents. We will be seeking the cooperation of the state and territory governments to provide us with the information of who is eligible. And given the success of the Reading Assistance Voucher program that commenced this year and will be delivered during the 2007 year, we believe there will be considerable interest and uptake for the vouchers as a result of the 2008 national literacy and numeracy tests.

I now refer to the budget measure Realising Our Potential—Rewarding Schools For Improving Literacy and Numeracy Outcomes. I ask the minister: why is the government directing $50 million to schools that have met literacy and numeracy benchmarks through $50,000 payments instead of investing that money in schools that need extra assistance in order to make the necessary improvements?

Likewise, we know that parents are concerned about standards in schools. We are aware that employers are concerned that young people lack these fundamental skills in literacy and numeracy and we have all heard stories and been told by universities that our universities even have to offer remedial classes in English for year 12 graduates. Year 12 graduates who go on to university would be considered amongst our best and brightest students and yet universities have to offer remedial English classes. So we are obviously concerned about the levels of literacy and numeracy.

We believe that those schools have a great story to tell. Schools that have been able to demonstrate substantial improvement in the literacy and numeracy achievements of their students, as measured by the national assessments and by their own applications, should be rewarded for their efforts in doing so. Those schools will then be able to use that funding to reward their teachers, to develop more resource material and to be used as best practice models for other schools around the country that are seeking to improve literacy and numeracy standards.

But, of course, we can only do so much. At the end of the day, the state and territory governments are responsible for the education systems in their states. I think it is a matter of considerable concern that literacy and numeracy levels in this country are falling. We must do all that we can as a federal government and in conjunction with state and territory governments to lift the literacy and numeracy standards. These are the fundamental skills that will ensure that students have an opportunity to succeed in life, go on to further education and training or get a job. I certainly make no apologies for the Australian government’s focus on rewarding schools who have been able to lift standards in literacy and numeracy and, likewise, providing parents with the safety net of support in the form of a $700 voucher for those students who have not met minimum standards in literacy and numeracy.

I use the expression deliberately, with respect to assimilation. What the minister said in terms of the importance of integration is something with which I do not differ, and it is why my portfolio has integration in the title. But it is curious that the Prime Minister, quite explicitly, purports something that the minister now tells us is not government policy. Minister, the media unit is not being used in the way it used to be used. Could you please explain how the role of the media unit has changed now that you are the minister?

As the honourable member would know, there is always a balance between those matters responded to directly by the minister’s office and those responded to directly by the department through the media unit. The media unit is doing a lot of work—for example, in relation to the new citizenship proposals. There is a quite considerable amount of work being done by the media unit and it will continue to be a valuable part of the department.

The number of visas, though—this is now theoretical on the basis that I will confirm the numbers—that are issued in a particular class does not necessarily mean that there is not a need. There could be 100 visas issued for which there is a need in 100 cases. There could be 10 visas issued for which there is a need in 10 cases. There could be a thousand visas issued for which there is a need in a thousand cases but I will provide the honourable member with the actual numbers of how many such visas have been issued.

This is a report which the honourable gentleman opposite will know arises out of a longer term concern of the United States in relation to trafficking in persons and that largely arises out of trafficking in relation to things such as so-called sexual slavery and sexual servitude and the like. Those same concerns, in my view, are not applicable to the 457 visa program. However, as the honourable gentleman will also know, the government is moving to place some greater sanctions in relation to any sponsor who seeks to abuse the 457 program. To date, the basic sanction against abuse of the program is the removal of the privilege of being able to use that program either for a temporary period of time or for a longer period of time.

As I said, I reject the one line—or two lines; I stand to be corrected—in what was an otherwise glowing report from the US state department. I am sure the honourable member will concede that the report was very supportive of Australia overall. I am sure he will also concede that Australia’s tier 1 ranking under that report indicates that, overall, the US state department not only has no real concerns about Australia but also regards Australia as one of those countries that has an exemplary program so far as these issues are concerned. So I think that comment—to the extent that it was made, in two lines—was misplaced. But even if the honourable gentleman wants, for the sake of argument, to suggest it was not misplaced, the measures that the government is putting in place would deal with those issues anyway.

That deals with the issue which he has raised. The further measures which the government intends to introduce will also deal with abuse more generally.

Take, for example, country X, which has its own sovereign entitlements. If a person is recruited in country X and makes a payment—whether for $5,000 or $10,000—towards a labour recruiter, then that activity in country X, being sovereign to that country, is outside any jurisdiction that we in Australia have. What we have sought to do is to make it clear that any payments made in Australia are within a band of what could be regarded as acceptable, and to put in place the further matters which I foreshadowed in terms of the penalties that might apply to employers. But if the honourable gentleman has any suggestions as to how we could put in place a regime which would have effect contrary to the sovereignty of another country within that country, then my door is open to any suggestion he might make.

The suggestion, for example, of a $20,000 payment to an agency or organisation in Australia has already been covered by the changes which the previous minister put in place. Other penalties which will apply in relation to the changes, which I have foreshadowed, will further address the issue.

If we were not able to do that, we would not be able to recognise the marriage laws of other countries in providing spouse visas, because how could we look at a marriage which was legally registered in a different country? The way we are able to do that, clearly, is that we allow our visa conditions to take into account behaviour that has been conducted overseas. Evidence can always be far more difficult to gather, but I put to the minister again: is it not a perfect example that the minister described earlier of people being in a situation of debt bondage, whether that debt has been incurred overseas or in Australia? Isn’t the capacity for debt bondage exactly the same, and isn’t the only difficulty for the Australian government, if it has the will, the gathering of evidence? Surely, Australia has a complete right to determine whether or not it will issue a visa.

I have just asked a question about payments made overseas, where Australia does have the right, if it chooses to take those payments into account, to refuse the granting of a visa. Is the minister saying that, if there is a debt bondage situation created overseas, that is now grounds to refuse an Australian 457 visa?

He can read them for himself. I was speaking earlier in relation to the matter which the honourable member raised—that is, the gathering of evidence and the ability to prove or disprove whether or not something happened overseas—and the difficulty in gathering that evidence, which is proved right or wrong. It is easy to make allegations one way or the other but, in terms of actually proving it, it is an entirely different matter.

The minister would know full well that this exact principle I am referring to is the cornerstone behind the use of extraterritorial power in relation to parliament making it unlawful in Australia for people to be involved in child sex crimes overseas. When there is the will to actually look, no matter how difficult the evidence may be to gather, the capacity is there to do it. My question to the minister is: is it an abuse of the 457 visa for someone to be paid $42,000 to perform work, when everybody in that same region of Australia is being paid $80,000?

I refer him once again to what has already been gazetted. He should not suggest that what has been gazetted is something other than what indeed has been gazetted. Clearly, he full well knows what has been gazetted. I come to the point. The honourable member is aware of the way in which the minimum threshold so far as salary is concerned operates. It operates in a way in which it was set effectively at above the market rate so far as salaries across the board are concerned. It was set at that level above the market rate in order to be a balance against full labour market testing in relation to every position or every job. But if one looks at the average salary that is being paid under 457 visas in Australia, one sees, as is my recollection, that it is of the order of $70,000 or $80,000.

I have explained to the honourable gentleman, as he knows well, that the average wage paid under 457 visas in Australia is in the order of $70,000 to $80,000, which is well in advance of the average wage in Australia, and that that system operates in an extremely useful way in finding labour in this country. What the honourable gentleman fails to say is that in an occupation in which the average wage in Australia is much less than the $42,000, leaving aside the regional difference, nonetheless there is a requirement under the present arrangements that that $42,000 or the regional equivalent be paid. So some visa holders are actually being paid more than what is the going rate in that particular industry. Indeed, I have businesspeople coming to me and complaining that they have to pay $42,000 in certain instances when in fact the going rate in Australia is $32,000 or $35,000. So the honourable gentleman ought to look at the entire picture rather than pick out one little part of it in relation to these programs.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In terms of the threshold itself, that threshold is adjusted from time to time and it has been moved upward from time to time. It operates at a different level in, for example, the information technology industry in Australia in which, generally, higher wages and salaries and conditions are offered and therefore it is set at a higher level above those. But the government will monitor it from time to time, taking into account that there are, as I said, some occupations in which bringing someone in from overseas on a 457 visa actually involves a greater amount of payment to the individual concerned than to an Australian worker who might be working alongside that person. As I said, the complaint is made by businesspeople to me from time to time that, if the average amount of payment for an Australian worker in a particular occupation in a particular industry and at a particular location is, for example, $32,000 and yet they are required to pay $42,000, how is that a fair outcome in relation to the comparison between the two?

I take it from the honourable gentleman’s remarks that he is not opposed to 457 visas in Australia. The total number of people coming in on 457 visas is not large in terms of the workforce in Australia. Having a workforce of over 10 million people in this country, we have on the last year’s numbers—obviously they vary a bit from year to year—some 40,000 visa holders as primary visa holders under the 457 program and about 30,000 secondary visa holders under that program. Even if you take the total of 70,000—or let us say it is 100,000 even—for a workforce of 10 million people in this country, that is not a large number when the reality is, in many industries, in many regions, in many parts of this country, that we are facing a shortage of workers.

Of course, that prosperity has an impact on other workers in Australia as well, not only those who are coming in from overseas but indeed, the prosperity of all Australians. So the government is committed to a temporary skilled visa program. We have resisted temptations and suggestions that have been made to us from time to time to lower that level of skill. The honourable gentleman knows, for example, that the trucking industry has been crying out, saying that it cannot find in particular long-distance truck drivers in this country.

But that is just one example of where industry in Australia is saying, ‘We simply cannot find the workers to undertake the type of work which is required if we want to continue to provide the services and therefore grow our industries and our businesses in Australia and provide work for Australians.’

It is valuable to Australia. To remove it would do enormous damage to the Australian economy. We monitor its operation from time to time. We try to ensure that any potential abuse is something that is dealt with, such as I have foreshadowed.

But the aim of this is to deal particularly with some more recent settlers to Australia, particularly those who have come, for example, from parts of Africa where, through no fault of their own, their circumstances are more difficult, if I can put it that way, in terms of settlement in Australia than perhaps earlier arrivals under the humanitarian program. These are people, for example, who have much lower levels of education than many earlier arrivals have. These are people for example who have spent a long period of time in war-torn and conflicted areas, and who have spent years, in some instances from very young ages, in refugee camps. It is a response to what we see as a greater humanitarian need in terms of the settlement program to have provided that additional money, but, as to the actual detail of it and the allocation of it, we are still working through aspects of that. I am quite happy to provide the honourable gentleman with more details about it when we have got all that to hand.

As I said earlier, one of the challenges we are facing, particularly from some of the settlers who have come from Africa, is that they are a younger population. Almost as a matter of definition, if you like, there is a stronger orientation towards youth simply because many of the people who are coming are much younger and therefore the services that are required for them differ maybe from services required for somebody who is a couple of decades older. Whilst, as I am advised, there is no deliberate policy to say we are reorienting to youth, the reality is that in addressing the needs of the population we are therefore dealing with a younger population.

Could the minister please investigate the question of whether there is an unfortunate practice of the department to regard people describing themselves as Bosnians as being the only Bosnians entering in this country? I put it that the former Yugoslavia tends to be a description which Bosnians in particular would be inclined to take up, as opposed to Croatians and Serbians who would be less inclined to describe themselves in that fashion. So limiting the grants to those people who specifically describe themselves as Bosnians is somewhat unfair to those previous service deliverers who have been denied funding this year.

If you take the forecasts out to 2011, we can expect some reductions in non-farm GDP deflator. In addition to that of course there is the three per cent increase in funding which the government has budgeted out to 2016. In simple terms, yes, by definition of the fact that the non-farm sector is catered for by the deflator, we have added into that an additional three per cent. In this budget we also budgeted for logistics, which, including what was done in the previous budget, takes us out to $4 billion for logistics—there is $1.8 billion additional in this budget. I do recognise that that additional funding for net personnel and operating costs will need to be dealt with before 2010. I also acknowledge in the context of the question that some of the through-life support and costs of maintaining defence will be in some cases below the three per cent. In other case, it will be above it. But, given all of the reasonable forecasts that we have got, yes, we do believe that it is adequate.

What it reflects is the fact that the complex nature of defence acquisitions is such that, as I have said publicly in the past, it is not like going down to the Ford dealership and buying a Territory or a Ghia. This is cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, highly complex technology which frequently has to operate in a war environment. So I think the member for Hunter would appreciate that projects are not always delivered on time. In fact, our delays at the moment are averaging 14 per cent, which is an improvement from 20 to 25 per cent three years ago. So the reprogramming represents the shift of money beyond the forward estimates period for projects that by definition are delayed.

As I said publicly from the Pentagon in July last year, Boeing has let itself down and it has let us down in relation to that. We have a remediation program for that at the moment, and only the weekend before last I met with

But Wedgetail is $110 million. Another project is the M113 upgrade, which is $77 million. That is the project with Tenix, and there are some issues in relation to brakes. But, whilst there are delays in the initial delivery, we are confident that the last vehicle will be delivered as originally scheduled. Then there is the Hornet upgrade, $68 million, and the

Australia is a Hornet country. It also gives Australia the option at the end of the next decade to on-sell the Super Hornet back to the

It is by far and away the poorest performing project of the so-called legacy projects that we are managing. It took the best part of 10 months for all of that advice to be gained in terms of what is actually involved in continuing with the aircraft, what other capability might it be used for at a lesser level, what would be involved in continuing and what would be the prospects for completing the project according to the milestones of capability. The government made the decision after quite detailed examination that we would continue with the project, including the deed, and we will most certainly be working very closely with Kaman, the principal contractor, to see that the key milestones are met. This is an aircraft that Australia will need for antiship warfare in littoral environs.

On unrelated matters, I ask the minister what commitment the government has made or intends to make towards the relocation of the Amberley school. He will be very familiar with this topic. The expansion of the RAAF base at Amberley will necessitate relocation of the school. Many parents there fear that their children will be broken up into a range of other schools rather than having a new school built for them.

The state of Queensland will argue that it is a Commonwealth responsibility because the Commonwealth has forced the move and I suspect that the Commonwealth will argue, and rightly so, that the state has a responsibility to make a contribution as well. In that bipartisan spirit, I ask the minister what he knows about the issue, where we are with it, what contribution the Commonwealth is likely to make and what he knows about the willingness of the state government in Queensland to make a contribution.

However, it is my view that we do have a responsibility to make a contribution to the relocation of that school in partnership with the Queensland department of education.

I believe we do have that responsibility, and I have asked my officials to work accordingly in that direction. I appreciate that the member for Hunter has political cousins in Queensland who are currently in government up there. To be perfectly fair, I think the Queensland state government should—and, I expect, will—come to the party and that we should be able to negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement.

The tactical advantage conferred alone by speed and gravitational manoeuvrability is not as dominant in the airspace as it once was. What Australia is building is a God’s eye view of the airspace, which means the Joint Strike Fighter is the fundamental platform with an airborne early warning command and control system, with the ground based Vigilair, which is the network centric air combat command and control system.
