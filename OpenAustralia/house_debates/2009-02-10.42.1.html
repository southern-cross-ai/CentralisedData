       <p>
        Today I would like to momentarily focus on Victoria and what is facing all of Australia. There is a deep sense of grief and loss, and there are many questions still to be answered. For all Australians it is a time when compassion and offers of practical help are pouring out towards Victorians. I think it is important that we continue to pray and support them in whatever way possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today is also a date when we need to acknowledge the very important and tragic event that happened to the people on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        and the HMAS
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        some 45 years ago. Today there is also a deep sense of loss which has been ongoing for many years. Today we remember the loss of 82 lives on the HMAS
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        , which sank on the night of 10 February 1964, some 45 years ago. The destroyer
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was operating as ‘rescue destroyer’ for night flying operations just off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Jervis Bay
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        when she collided with the aircraft carrier HMAS
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        . The
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        was cut in two. The bow section sank almost immediately while the stern section remained on the surface for several hours.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was great bravery on that night. I would particularly like to highlight the bravery of one man. I mention Chief Petty Officer Jonathan Rogers, who was serving on the
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        . The story of his courage is well told in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        ’s ‘Fifty Australians’. It reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Rogers was one of more than 50 men trapped in darkness in a compartment of the sinking forward section.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He took control and tried to bring calm in the disastrous situation. He probably realised that not all would be able to get through a small escape hatch and that he, being a large man, had no chance at all. “He was more intent on getting the younger chaps out first,” said a survivor. The forward section finally sank about ten minutes after the impact. Rogers was heard leading his remaining doomed comrades in a prayer and a hymn during their final moments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Rogers was later awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         George Cross
        </a>
        , the highest bravery award then available in peacetime, “for organising the escape of as many as possible and encouraging … those few who could not escape … to meet death alongside himself with dignity and honour”.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we reflect today we must also remember that for 45 years the survivors have had to deal with loss. I refer to those men on the
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        and their families and friends who were left behind. The collision of the
        <i>
         Melbourne
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Voyager
        </i>
        is an example of the sad and too common occurrence of lives being lost in the service of Australia during peacetime. It is also a reminder that we must constantly strive to do better for all our young men and women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and their families in both war and peacetime. We must remember them, we must honour them and it is important that we never forget.
