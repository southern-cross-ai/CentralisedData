        On Wednesday, 13 June, I attended the

         Colonel Light Gardens
        </a>
        Senior Citizens Club's Devonshire afternoon tea, along with my hardworking state colleague Carolyn Habib MP, the member for Elder, and Mayor Glenn Spear and Lady Mayoress Tracey Spear. Along with club members, we were treated to an afternoon of entertainment by cabaret singer Marianne while enjoying scones made by the committed club members. The afternoon tea was just one of many events held by the Colonel Light Gardens senior citizens, who meet weekly at the Colonel Light Gardens

        for bingo, to hear from guest speakers, to listen to musicians or to take daytrips.

        We know that being active is vital for healthy ageing. The Colonel Light Gardens senior citizens, with their range of activities, are certainly leading the way. When I spoke to club members, I was not surprised to learn that, like so many local volunteers, they don't just volunteer with senior citizens but also with a range of other community organisations. The Turnbull government know how important it is for our senior Australians to stay active and happy, which is why we have committed over $100 million to tackle isolation, loneliness and mental health issues in older Australians. We have also committed a further $22.9 million to encourage increased physical activity in our senior citizens. Thank you to the Colonel Light Gardens Senior Citizens Club for what they do to provide a support network and activities for the local community. Thank you to President Jill Carlaw and her committee for everything they do for the community.
