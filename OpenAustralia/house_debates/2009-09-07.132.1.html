       <p>
        I rise this evening to bring to the attention of this parliament a very serious problem which is threatening the livelihoods and potentially the health of fruit growers on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite_Belt" rel="nofollow">
         Granite Belt
        </a>
        in my electorate of Maranoa. The Granite Belt boasts highly reputable wineries and fruit orchards. However their viability is being threatened by the city-centric Queensland state Labor government, which cares more about securing Green votes than it does about the orchardists who grow our apples, cherries, olives and many other summer fruits. Last year the Bligh government revoked damage mitigation permits and imposed a ban on using lethal methods to control flying fox populations. Despite their promise to have non-lethal deterrents in place in time for this next season, they are nowhere near ready and so the Granite Belt orchards remain vulnerable and in danger of being destroyed by flying foxes. But this is not only an issue for the viability of these orchards and the families they support. It is also a health issue. Bats are a natural reservoir for many deadly diseases, including of course, the Hendra virus. Just last week, Rockhampton vet Alister Rodgers lost his life after contracting the disease from an infected horse. It may only be a matter of time before this virus is transmitted directly from bat to human.

        Of course, I am against the mindless culling of these animals. But in order for us to protect one of Australiaâ€™s strongest fruit-growing regions, to protect the viability of these businesses and ultimately to protect lives, we must accept that lethal control methods are the most effective and most humane option.
