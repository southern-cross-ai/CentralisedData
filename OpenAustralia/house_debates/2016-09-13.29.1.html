       <p>
        It is a fact that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        needs a major injection of local jobs to become the thriving centre of opportunity that it deserves to be. That is why our community supported our plan to deliver 600 new federal jobs, mainly from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        , into Gosford during two federal elections. Over the last few years I have held hundreds of listening posts, community meetings and round tables regarding this desperate need for local jobs. but let us contrast this with Labor. Just last week, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill" rel="nofollow">
         O'Neill
        </a>
        sent an error ridden open letter through the media that was misleading and bizarre, and it only highlights Labor's opposition to local jobs and growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        My commitment has always been to jobs, not to a building. In deciding the location for 600 new jobs in Gosford, the ATO chose a site that is a two-minute walk to the centre of Gosford. It was selected independently by the ATO through an open, thorough tender processâ€”and that is as it should be. Senator O'Neill actually confirmed this in a series of stunts in the Senate. Labor now wants to build a performing arts centre on that very land. So why did Senator O'Neill spend three years as the local member publicly campaigning for it to be elsewhere? And why doesn't the senator admit another simple fact: that the location of the performing arts centre is actually up to the council to decide?
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses describe our 600 new jobs as a catalyst project our region needs. It is a catalyst that I will fight to see delivered, with 600 new jobs into Gosford by the end of next year. The future of our region depends on it.
