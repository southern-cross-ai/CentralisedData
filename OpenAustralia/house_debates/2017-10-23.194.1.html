        I'm very sad to report to the parliament that our region lost a wonderful gentleman, Neil Preston, last week. I got to know Neil very well during his time as Greenacres chief executive. He was a determined and well-respected advocate for people with a disability. His advocacy led to him being named Wollongong Citizen of the Year in 2014 and also earned him an

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        When Neil retired in 2011, the member for Whitlam and I hosted then

        , who was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, on a surprise visit to Neil at work to present him with a certificate of appreciation for his years of public service and advocacy in the disability sector. He had been an engineer, and this was a significant career change for him. He sometimes wondered how he ended up there, but he was an absolute asset to the disability sector and it was great for the sector that he did. Indeed, at the time of his retirement, the current Labor leader,
