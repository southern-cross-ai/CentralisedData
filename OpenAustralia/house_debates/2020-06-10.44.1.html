        This year, 2020, has been a year of shocks, and in the midst of it all last month came another terrible shock for northern Tasmania with the sudden death of Vaughn Dell. Vaughn was a young, dynamic and visionary winemaker who was a loving husband to Linda and a devoted dad to Esme and Clementine. Vaughn grew up on Tasmania's north-west coast. He was a skilled sportsman, playing

        for both the

        </a>
        , with a love of sport that he passed on to his daughters. Together with Linda, and aged just 23, he established the award-winning Sinapius vineyard, part of the

        wine route, and after the planting of some 30,000 vines Sinapius now boasts 11 different varieties and is part of a close-knit community of vineyards and winemakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those in the wine industry described Vaughn as being ahead of his time, with a meticulous attention to detail that was evident in everything he did, noting that he was brave and patient and backed himself with every decision he made. Vaughn was recognised for his efforts in 2017, when he was awarded the prestigious Dr Don Martin Sustainable Viticulture Fellowship, travelling abroad to study.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaughn was just 39 years of age. He was loved and respected by the hundreds of people who raised a glass to him in farewell, although COVID-19 restrictions meant that had to be done online. I send my love and best wishes to Linda, Clementine and Esme. Vaughn leaves a remarkable and enduring legacy. Vale, Vaughn Dell.
