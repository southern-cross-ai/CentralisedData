        On 15 October I attended be feast day at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Luke's" rel="nofollow">
         St Luke's
        </a>
        parish in Revesby. It was a wonderful day. It started with a mass, and there were broader celebrations in the school grounds afterwards. About a thousand people were there, celebrating 74 years of St Luke's and celebrating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_the_Evangelist" rel="nofollow">
         Luke the Evangelist
        </a>
        , after whom the church was named. I'd like to thank Father Dariusz Basiaga, for all his work in our community, and particularly the parish secretary, Pauline Sahyoun, who does so much work. St Luke's is an absolute bedrock of the community. It does an enormous amount of work in providing support through the church community and through broader community activities as well. Congratulations and thank you to St Luke's.

        For some 40 years, a Vietnamese language school has been held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankstown_Girls_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Bankstown Girls High School
        </a>
        , just outside my electorate. It was great to attend the 40th anniversary celebrations on 21 October. There were wonderful performances by the kids. It was great to see Trong Ho. There were so many parents there, teachers from the school. Long-term supporters, such as Mr Quang Luu AO and Mr Thuat Van Nguyen, who of course is so well known for founding the Sydney children's festival. It was a tremendous day, and a great testament to Bankstown Girls High School as well for supporting the Vietnamese language school for some 40 years.

        Lugarno
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC" rel="nofollow">
         FC
        </a>
        is a legendary club in our area, and it was great to attend its presentation morning on a very hot Sunday morning on 22 October. Sue Dick, the club's president, has been involved in the club for decades and is a tremendous pioneer for football generally and for women's football in our community. It was great to see Sue there. The irrepressible Bec Harrison, the registrar, was there. Former president Michael Jarevski was there, as were so many others—people who come together to make Lugarno FC the very special place it is. Congratulations to all the kids who received awards on the day, and well done Lugarno FC for another great year.

        On 24 September, a new event was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connells_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Connells Point
        </a>
        . The Connells Point Community Markets Day is the brainchild of Patrick Wedes, who's a busy man because he's also president of the Pinnacle club in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Hurstville" rel="nofollow">
         South Hurstville
        </a>
        where he's overseeing a major renovation. In his spare time, he set up this fantastic market day that was attended by hundreds of people. There were rides for the kids; there were lots of great stalls; there were farm animals—the whole thing. There were lots of people having lots of fun. It was a great thing for Connells Point. Well done Patrick and the community, and I look forward to this being an annual event.
