       <p>
        I rise today to speak about the Stronger Communities Program in the electorate of Lyons. Lyons is a large electorate, at least by Tasmanian standards. There are no really large towns, but there are many smaller communities and villages as well. This program has been an ideal way for them to attract money from the Commonwealth on a dollar-for-dollar basis, often matched with in-kind contributions rather than cash. As we know, many small community groups often find it hard to put their hands on hard cash when they are supported only by their membership. This program, with its in-kind contribution, has been very welcome.
       </p>

        I also thank the committee. In round 1 of the program, the committee was chaired by Lyn Mason, with committee members Viv Cardwell, Melissa Ferguson, Kevin Faulkener and Natalie Geard. In the second round, the chair was

        , with Jessica Whelan, Viv Cardwell and Melissa Ferguson. I thank them for the work that they did in identifying projects from the very large range of projects that were put forward, and in making recommendations to me which were then submitted to the department.

        congratulate the St Helens Neighbourhood House, and particularly Patricia Duffy, on funding of $13,600 that will enable an extension of the op shop and the purchase of giant games that they will use for community events. I met recently with Rachel Hodge and Rick of Saint Marys Hub4Health to see the project that they are undertaking to incorporate lighting and carpets into a gym in

I congratulate Rick Churchill and Kath Clark of the Bicheno Golf Club on funding of $15,000 to upgrade the irrigation infrastructure on the golf course. Also to the Sheffield Golf Course—to Lyn Thomas, Judy Laing, Diane Smith, Neville Pulford, Nigel Quinn and Denise Morgan: congratulations on putting a boundary fence there to remove the risk of vermin coming on and damaging the golf course and creating other problems. Sheffield's Mural Park is a new entrant;
