       <p>
        I rise to congratulate a tremendous athlete from the electorate of Bass, the world champion Mr Daniel Geale. Last week, Daniel retained his prestigious
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBF" rel="nofollow">
         IBF
        </a>
        world middleweight boxing championship, with a victory over Osumanu Adama. Geale, originally from Rocherlea in my electorate, is always a crowd pleaser when he fights in Tasmania. One crowd member watching the fight last week was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , another world-class Tasmanian athlete and former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Brooks High School
        </a>
        student. Brooks High now counts Geale, Ponting and the F1 in Schools team as former students who have made world champion status in their chosen field. Many of Tasmania's leading businesspeople are also former Brooks High students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Geale received a unanimous points verdict from the judges to retain the title of IBF middleweight world boxing champion. This was a tremendous effort. The first two defences of his title have both been held in Tasmania, showing Geale's commitment to his home state of Tasmania. This is a reflection of his humble and modest character. I am certain that when Daniel next defends his world title, on the world stage overseas, he will display those wonderful personal attributes and traits, along with his dedication, hard work and courage, as an ambassador not only for Tasmania but for all Australians. Daniel is yet another example of the wonderful athletes that the great electorate of Bass can call theirs.
