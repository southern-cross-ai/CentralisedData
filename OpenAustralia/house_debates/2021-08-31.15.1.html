       <p>
        [by video link] Lockdowns don't just affect businesses in the areas locked down. Other businesses hurt too. The too little, too late approach of the Morrison government on business support is being felt across Australia. Recently, alongside Senator Polley, I visited Tasmania and joined my friend Ross Hart, the former and future member for Bass, visiting small retail businesses in Launceston that told us how they have been affected by the pandemic. When the mainland is locked down, Tassie gets a hit too. There's no consumer confidence in locals, and piecemeal support packages from this federal government aren't good enough.
       </p>

        I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_Avion" rel="nofollow">
         Par Avion
        </a>
        , a small tourism business that gives people the opportunity to view the sites of Tasmania from a whole new perspective, as well as providing flight training. Businesses like these outside lockdown areas are affected by COVID restrictions and need real support. They need a national plan of support, not threats from the Treasurer to withdraw support. I also visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_College" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Maritime College
        </a>
        . The work they are doing is vital to supporting our Australian defence industry and capability and our ADF. They are a truly national institution that should be proud of all that they do, but they need more support from this government to expand their facilities, along with our sovereign capability. I also visited the Forager Food Co, a Tassie owned and operated innovative food company. We learned about their cutting-edge technology and exciting plans for the future, especially working with our defence forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmanian small businesses are working hard, right on the cutting edge. But they're doing it tough now and need more support at the national level.
