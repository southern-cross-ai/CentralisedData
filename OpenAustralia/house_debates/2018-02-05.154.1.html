        On 26 January we celebrated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        , which is the day for all Australians to celebrate our peaceful, free and democratic nation. It's a day when we celebrate and recognise our Indigenous heritage, our British heritage, our migrant heritage and the fact that we are one of the most diverse and successful countries in the world. I was privileged to spend the day in my electorate of Boothby recognising our new citizens who have made a commitment to Australia and our way of life and acknowledging our local residents and organisations who have tirelessly served our community. I was delighted to personally welcome the new citizens of the

         City of Mitcham
        </a>

        and the

         City of Onkaparinga
        </a>
        , on behalf of the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , at ceremonies across Boothby.
       </p>
       <p>
        We welcome migrants from across the world, including from India, Zambia, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Nepal, Turkey and Thailand. These residents contribute their unique skills, experiences and culture to our community, enriching us all. I extend my warmest congratulations to all new citizensâ€”in particular, to those who joined our community of Boothby on Australia Day. Strong communities are characterised by the many committed volunteers and organisations found within it. My electorate of Boothby is no exception. That's why I was honoured and humbled to hear about the selfless work of all of this year's nominees for local citizenship awards across the councils in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to recognise and thank all the nominees for their service and acknowledge their contribution to our community, as recognised by my local mayors on behalf of our councils. They are: Mayor Glenn Spear of Mitcham, Mayor Kris Hanna of Marion, Deputy Mayor Amanda Wilson on behalf of Mayor Stephen Patterson of Holdfast Bay, and Mayor Lorraine Rosenberg of the City of Onkaparinga.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to recognise community groups and individuals in Boothby who won awards. I was delighted to see community groups like the Blackwood Action Group recognised by the City of Mitcham for their annual Christmas tree festival; the Marion Swimming Club, recognised by the City of Marion as sports team of the year; and the Brighton Jetty Sculptures event in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Holdfast_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         City of Holdfast Bay
        </a>
        . The awards also recognise the work of individuals and young citizens, including local artist Sue Norman, who was the recipient of the City of Holdfast Bay community recognition award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, sincere congratulations to the citizen of the year winners: for the City of Mitcham, orthopaedic surgeon Professor Jegan Krishnan; for the City of Marion,
