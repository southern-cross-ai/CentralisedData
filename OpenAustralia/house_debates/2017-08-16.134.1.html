        I stand before you today to recognise some of Mackellar's most courageous men and women. They have recently been commended at the

        police awards ceremony. These individuals, both civilians and law enforcement officers, have placed their own lives in danger for the betterment of society, and they deserve our greatest appreciation. Senior Constable Thomas McKinnon received the commissioner's unit citation for outstanding service and devotion to his duties during Strike Force Durkin, a strike force set up to apprehend a violent offender who had been on the run for over six years. Senior Constable McKinnon, I thank you for your service. For courage and dedication to their duties as members of the

        police rescue squad, Chief Inspector Graeme Pickering, retired Senior Constable Janine Probst and retired Sergeant Stephen Spencer were all awarded the region commander's unit citation.

        In March 2013, following an argument with her boyfriend, a 40-year-old female ran towards the Avalon headland in an attempt to jump off the cliff. Mr Ian Streeter, a brave resident of my electorate of Mackellar, witnessed this unfold and, without any regard for his own personal safety, ran to restrain the woman. He placed himself on the ledge of this cliff, risking his life to save hers. Thanks to his courage, no-one was injured in what could have been an awful loss of life. Mr Streeter was deservingly presented with the region commander's certificate of commendation, and the people of Mackellar thank him for his bravery.

        In June of this year, while on patrol, two brave police officers, Sergeant Nino Jelovic and Detective Senior Constable Jennifer Thom, identified a vehicle containing two offenders wanted for a number of serious assaults in the Northern Beaches area. While the suspect's car was stopped at traffic lights, these two police officers descended on the vehicle and subsequently placed the two wanted individuals under arrest. Thanks to their brave police work, two violent criminals were arrested and subsequently charged and taken off the streets. Sergeant Nino Jelovic and Detective Senior Constable Jennifer Thom were each presented with the local area commander's commendation. Brave and selfless acts such as these don't happen all the time. It was my great honour to be a part of recognising some of our local heroes.
