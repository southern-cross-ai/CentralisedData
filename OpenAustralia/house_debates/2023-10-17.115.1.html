        I rise to thank a wonderful group of Wannon residents who ran with me or supported the run for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. To raise awareness and much-needed funds for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , we went from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        here in Canberra to Warrnambool—some 950 kilometres. Matty Stewart, the key ideas man and organiser who lost his father, Bobby, to CJD, and James Kenna, a gun runner and gun golfer who lost his father, Jimmy, to CJD, joined with me on this journey with some wonderful support. I lost my mother, Marie, and my

        to CJD.

        , and our wonderful support crew, Jack, Gerard and Danny Kenna. We ran and we had a lot of fun, and we did some really important work. We raised over $80,000, which will go into research for CJD.
       </p>
       <p>
        Up until now, there has never been a cure for CJD. Once you're diagnosed with it, it's a sentence. For the first time—and we heard this news 24 hours before we headed off—there will be a trial to find a cure for CJD. The co-chair of the CJD family support group, Suzanne, was there with us to see us off in Canberra last Saturday week, along with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">

        Canberra Raiders female coach, who gave us a very inspirational speech to head us on our way. The fun included a guest appearance by one of the lead singers of a folk band called Old Melbourne Road.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Murphy" rel="nofollow">

        came and sang for us, but he also recounted the story of how he lost his mother to CJD at about the same time I did. He had never spoken about it because of the stigma associated with it. We had a lot of fun that night, like we did right along the trip, and we got a wonderful welcome when we arrived back in Warrnambool this Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've made lifelong friends through this journey. The bond that was built between the group of us who did this 950-kilometre odyssey will last forever. I want to thank everyone who ran, who supported us, who donated, who tooted their horns and who shared on social media. CJD is on the way to getting a cure because of some of the work that we did.
