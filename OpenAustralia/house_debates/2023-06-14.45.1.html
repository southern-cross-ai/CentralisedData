        Over 800 members of the community of Saint Ignatius' College Riverview in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        have put their name to this petition to urgently draw our parliament's attention to the impact of climate change across Australia. They specifically ask us to acknowledge that Australia is experiencing more frequent and severe climactic conditions, which particularly impact the most vulnerable in our community, including those from regional Australia; and Indigenous communities, including the Torres Strait Islands, with people losing their homes, livelihoods and sacred sites.

        These students have asked this House to take immediate action to reduce the impacts of climate change by urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting impacted communities. They are articulate, compassionate and inspiring, and typical of the young people I meet every day in my community. Indeed, in a recent youth summit, people from across North Sydney spoke with me about the issues facing their generation, with environmental concerns high on their agenda. One student actually shared with me that she had moved to Australia two years ago only to face a barrage of bushfires and flooding, which completely crushed her ideal vision of Australia. Another worried about the rapid rate of deforestation and extinctions. These voices are the future, and we all have a responsibility to hear them and take action to protect the planet they will inherit. I encourage my fellow parliamentarians to heed this petition.
