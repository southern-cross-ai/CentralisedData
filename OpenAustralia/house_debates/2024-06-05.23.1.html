        I'm happy to explain the amendments on the basis of any consideration of detail. We presented the bill in March and it follows the review, but we always understood that, in presenting the bill, we wanted the contribution of people in the disability sector. We were interested to hear days of hearings from the Senate committee and to talk to the disability sector in the event that they could make observations as to how we could further improve the initial bill. These amendments represent the recognition that we can improve the bill, courtesy of contributions from crossbenchers, from the disability sector and from submissions that we have received. I'm happy to engage in the debate.

         I have a very quick statement on these amendments.

          The Greens
         </a>
         believe these amendments are a rushed attempt to make a bad bill slightly more acceptable. They demonstrate that the government still has not heard the feedback they have assertively received from the disability community, as the identified issues have not come close to being properly addressed. While there are some parts of the government amendments that will not actively make the bill worse, the fundamental issues are unchanged. There are also some parts of these amendments that will increase ministerial power, and these are of great concern to us. The Greens have heard the disability community and we will continue to work with disabled people and their families to oppose this rushed bill which will do so much harm to disabled people.

          I don't share the member's concerns and I don't think it's a fair characterisation of the process. The member says it's been rushed. We've had a four-year disability royal commission and a 12-month review into the whole scheme. I worry that the argument that there's too much rush is actually selling people with disability short, because there are problems which need to be dealt with now.
         </p>
         <p>
          I don't know if the member heard my second reading contribution. It's forgivable if you didn't, but I'll just repeat a couple of the key points in it. There are issues which need to be resolved now. Every month we wait sees people with disability, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          and taxpayers face costs of an extra $160 million. This is a real issue. We've moved amendments, and I'll go through them. There was a concern that somehow NDIS support needs were going to be narrowed. We've clarified that to make sure that, as we move from line to line, budgeting on a more flexible basis, we have a constitutional basis and some reasonable constraints. We've heard concerns about the use of the APTOS—the Applied Principles and Tables of Support, first agreed by first ministers in 2015 as an interim approach to defining NDIS supports—that it was out of date and not sufficiently clear. We've updated that, reflecting the concerns of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Advocacy_Centre" rel="nofollow">
           Public Interest Advocacy Centre
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Other amendments include technical amendments to clarify the operation of new provisions and to improve the operation of planning provisions in section 23. We want to provide certainty about the amount of funding that participants have available during a specified time and assist participants in managing their funding. Our amendments clarify exceptional circumstances when payments can be made above a relevant funding amount. Our amendments make clear the legislative instruments setting out the needs assessment process and the method for calculating reasonable and necessary budgets, and that the minister needs to have regard to section 4(9A), which states that 'people with disability are central to the NDIS'. So we're putting in a specific endorsement of the principle of co-design. We're placing limitations on the proposed new powers of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          to request a participant to attend an assessment or examination. But we do need some powers because, at the moment, there are 13,000 participants whom we are unable to contact. That's not a realistic proposition going forward.

         <p>
          We are expressly going to require the CEO to provide a needs assessment report to the participant. There's been talk in the scheme that, somehow, participants won't get to be consulted about their needs assessment. That's not true. There's also a myth, which has been circulated, that review rights around the needs assessment are being abolished—they're specifically not. In fact, I thank Dr Ryan and PIAC, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, and others for making sure that we are doubled down on the basis of the existence of internal/external review processes.

            I'm speaking on behalf of the member for Kooyong, who's not here today due to sickness. I'm pleased that the government has accepted some of the amendments proposed by the member for Kooyong and supported by the sector, specifically around requiring appropriate consultation and co-design in the development of rules about the needs assessment and support, which has been a real concern; embedding the review of the needs assessment and statement of participant supports; giving participants surety that they will be able to have those draft documents reviewed by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>
            on request; and giving participants the right to obtain and/or request a replacement assessment in relation to each statement of participant supports when they don't agree with the first needs assessment. The remaining amendments that I'll be discussing today provide some additional protections for participants and the sector. I would like to point out that a number of these amendments have been agreed quite quickly. It may be that some of these amendments are covered by the government amendments, and we'll be looking at them in great detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            To run through those: in amendment (2), the proposed section 32H creates additional requirements for accessing support, which may include requiring supports provided by a specific person or specific conditions are satisfied. The advocacy groups are concerned that this wording could place an inappropriately broad range of potential constraints on participants' choice and control over their funding and supports, particularly where the discretion to impose those constraints would lie with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
             NDIA
            </a>
            alone. Amendment (2) makes it clear that additional requirements could only be specified where necessary to achieve a specific purpose consistent with the objects of the scheme and where the imposition of that requirement would not be unduly burdensome for a participant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendment (4) relates to consultation on delegated legislation. Under the proposed amendments put by the government, the minister has addressed this. Additional delegated legislation for needs assessment and budget-setting can be created, and this amendment (4) provides greater comfort about to consultation process by requiring the tabling of a consultation statement, which seems reasonable given the level of concern in the sector about the lack of consultation and co-design and the consequences of that. The government must develop the delegated legislation—the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
             NDIS
            </a>
            rules—via consultation, co-design and testing, which must include
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            people with disability; people from disability-specific communities; people from rural, regional and remote locations; people with disability who are digitally excluded; people with disability from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and LGBTQIA+ people with disability. That's why there's that additional requirement in relation to the consultation process.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a number of additional amendments there that relate to holistic understanding of the participants' disability supports, which is a really important part; it is not linked to specific impairments—also in relation to the report of the assessment, to be prepared with the participant to make sure that there is appropriate engagement with a participant and also in relation to replicating the need for consultation in making determinations about the assessment process.
           </p>
           <p>
            I encourage the government to look at these assessments and thank the minister for his engagement on these amendments. We'll be looking very closely at the delegated legislation to ensure that the disability community's concerns are addressed in the development of that delegated legislation.

            <p>
             I might briefly reply to the member for Curtin's submissions on behalf of the member for Kooyong, who couldn't be with us. I acknowledge that both members, including the crossbench, have been very interested in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             development, and I appreciate the constructive discussions we've had. There'll be a subsequent amendment, which I think we agree on and which the crossbench is moving, but some of the government amendments that we just voted on did actually reflect some of the issues. They were an attempt—perhaps imperfect—to meet the crossbench concerns halfway. So some of the amendments we've already voted on go to some of the issues somewhat that the member for Curtin was raising.
            </p>
            <p>
             Specifically, with regard to the proposed amendment to section 32H, we think that the test of 'unduly burdensome' is difficult to apply. We think it could defeat the purpose of the provision, which is to support agency commissioned supports. We're trying to deal with a situation where there are thin markets. We are not restricting choice and control, but the reality is that, where there are thin markets in regional and remote Australia, we need to look at direct commissioning, and that's what this is about.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the amendments to section 32K, we've tried to meet that halfway. I'm a believer in co-design and co-production with people with disability. That's what I've been doing for 17 years in this House. We accept the crossbench proposition that they'd like to see more focus on it. We feel the extent that this specific amendment goes to creates a legal risk of precedent setting across the government, but we have just voted in the House to ensure that a specific reference to considering the principle of co-design has to be taken into account.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the amendment to section 32L, the reason we don't like it, in shorthand, is that we think it creates an opening of the floodgates for the health system to transfer their costs into the NDIS, which is already a challenge. That's the substance of why we don't want to create expectations that the NDIS could fund support needs outside the scope of the NDIS and not relate it to impairments to meet the disability or early intervention requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the amendment of section 32L, we've tried to cover that already in a different form with the last of our amendments that we just voted on. Our issue with why we couldn't quite go to the extent that the crossbench would have liked in this amendment is that we don't know the form of needs assessment there will be, and we therefore don't know the form that the reports will take. It's likely that the report will simply reflect the content of the needs assessment without providing commentary on it, so involvement of the participant may not be needed at that the point when they have a requirement to be involved either before or at the conclusion of the assessment of the plan. Potentially, the issue driving this amendment could be addressed by amendments confirming that a support needs assessment is provided to the participant with an opportunity to comment, and that's what we'd seek to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             With section 32L(7), the next amendment, I worry that what we want to discourage is what you would call doctor shopping. That's essentially where people move between report writers until they get the report they want. We want to have a proper assessment, and we want a transparent assessment which the participant can agree to, disagree to or modify, but there is an issue now of people shopping around, and we just want to take that moral hazard off the table but still give the participant empowerment in the process, which is what we're doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the amendment to section 32L allowing the minister to determine the needs assessment, we worry that there's some legal risk with that. We think that the amendments are too vague; therefore, I'm advised that the risk is not insubstantial. We will consult. We already have a co-design requirement under subsection 4(9A) of the NDIS Act, as well as under the Legislation Act. We will work on talking with disability organisations, but we don't think this amendment is necessary to tell us to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the amendment removing section 34(1)(aa), this paragraph provides that a reasonable and necessary support in an old framework plan must be necessary to address the needs of the participant arising from an impairment in relation to which the participant meets the disability or intervention requirements. This is a lever by which we can help make sure that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
              NDIA
             </a>
             can constrain funding for impairments that would not be most appropriately supported through the NDIS.
            </p>
            <p>
             The proposed amendment (11) doesn't prevent the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             from making a further request, because we're not sure that that amendment would achieve the apparent policy approach.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the insertion of a new circumstance which is a variation of a participant's reasonably assumed budget, we think that this circumstance was not included for the new framework plans as it can fuel intraplan inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're trying to make sure that we respect where the amendments are coming from, but we also think that we've met them partway.

               I just want to make a very quick point, and then I'll hand over. We respect not just the crossbench contributions but the research behind them. We have met the issues around co-design. In my second reading speech I addressed that this is not giving new debt-raising powers, this is not giving the

                CEO
               </a>
               new powers, and this is not getting rid of review processes. We look forward to the amendment about reviewing the bill in five years' time, and, because of the contribution from the amendments—if we haven't agreed to them in letter or in word—we have taken up the principle, certainly around co-design.

                   I move amendment (1), as circulated in the name of the member for Kooyong:

                  </p>

                  <p class="italic">
                   (b) give the Minister a written report of the review in sufficient time to enable the Minister to comply with subsection
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   (3) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 9 months after the end of that 5-year period.

                  <p>
                   Amendment (1) relates to requiring an independent review after a five-year period that involves consultation with the public, with a written report to be tabled within nine months. Given the scale of these changes and the importance of getting this right, it seems appropriate to consider the impact of these amendments and have a look at how they're actually working. This is a huge piece of legislation regarding a very expensive scheme. On that basis, I think it would be reasonable to have a review of how the changes to the scheme are working after that period.

                   <p>
                    The government thinks that this is a very good amendment. In recent times it hasn't been uncommon to include a requirement to review legislation after a set period of time.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A part of the reason that we're agreeing to this is that the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                     NDIS
                    </a>
                    doesn't belong to any political party or to any particular point of view. It belongs to Australia. The NDIS is a universal scheme which is based on the proposition that any of us or anyone that we love could have a disability.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The scheme is remarkable. It is very difficult necessarily to please everyone, not because that's the motivation but rather that for people who've fought hard to get a set of supports, the talk of any change is legitimately anxious making. But the alternative of doing nothing as opposed to changing the scheme would be disastrous. The alternative views that it's too hard or that we should be suspicious of anything, provide the shadows in which some service providers continue to exploit participants and we don't get the best outcomes.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I do compare the NDIS to Medicare, but Medicare is now 40-plus years old, and it's taken its time to develop, and it's had its ups and its downs. What is pleasing in Australia at the moment is that Medicare used to be a contested political item over a series of elections. The NDIS has this opportunity to move from being a contested issue into one where people of all political persuasions just want to make sure it works as well as it can, but there's no questioning that it should exist, and I think we've reached that point so far. I say to those who are worried about this legislation: we'll certainly listen to opposition amendments in the Senate—to amendments from the Greens political party and, indeed, from crossbenchers there—but the argument that somehow everything is too hard and we should delay things and keep delaying them sells short the future of the scheme and people with disability.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Disability advocates have a lot of muscle memory about previous policy changes, which disturbs them and makes them legitimately concerned about any proposals. But these proposals are not out of the blue. That is not a fair characterisation. I want to be very clear that we have had a one-year review by Bruce Bonyhady and Lisa Paul. There was a lot of consultation. It was independent—despite the odd snide attempt to say it wasn't. It was an honest endeavour to look at how we could improve the scheme.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think what the review did and what the legislation assumes is that the NDIS is a giant chapter in the history of people with disability in this country. There had been work done before the NDIS, in human rights legislation and a range of areas, but the NDIS is indisputably a giant chapter because it provides economic agency and empowerment to people with disability and the people who love them. It is an endeavour to relieve aging carers' midnight anxiety about who will look after their adult family member when they no longer can. It is also a view that impairment is just one attribute of a human being and that the barriers society puts in people's path are what truly disables people. This scheme sees people in the whole. This legislation proposes that our processes to assess them should be in the whole.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is not the only measure we're taking, as I've said previously in the House and elsewhere, but this legislation is another necessary step on the journey to creating a more inclusive Australia. The government have no hubris about it. We will continue listening to the contributions and continue to take seriously the views of others. That's why we're happy to support this amendment, in that spirit. I congratulate the member for Kooyong for working on this issue.
