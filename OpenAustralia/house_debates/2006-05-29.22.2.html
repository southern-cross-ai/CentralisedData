       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity today in the House to acknowledge the passing of Mr Ron Byrnes. Ron was a very important member of our community. He worked in the mines for many years and retired as a mine deputy. But he had a significant involvement in community organisations, particularly as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        subbranch board and the Woonona-Bulli Memorial Club board, where he was returning officer. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work he did in his role as the welfare officer. He was also a board member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
         WEA
        </a>
        and involved in the Illawarra Lapidary Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I attended Ronâ€™s funeral on Friday, which was attended by over 300 people, including members of his church, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        , his lapidary club and representatives of the RSL. Ron is survived by his wife, Pem; his daughter, Alison, and her partner, Paul; his son, Colin, and his wife, Sally; and his grand-daughter, Kimberley. On behalf of our community I would like to extend our sympathy to the family and express our great appreciation for the contribution that Ron made to his community in his working life and in his retirement.
