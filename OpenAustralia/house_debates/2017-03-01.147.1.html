        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        was very significant in the electorate of Bradfield, as it was around the country. Some eight constituents received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , and I want to acknowledge those awards: Reverend Dr Roger Chilton of St Swithun's in Pymble for service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Anglican Church
        </a>
        of Australia and the community, Mr Michael McEwen for service to the community through a range of organisations, Mrs Pamela Walker for service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        in Australia and to pastoral care programs, Mrs Patricia Spooner for service to the community through volunteer roles, Mrs Susan Nurse for service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church in Australia
        </a>
        , Ms Tiffany Thomas Kane for service to sport—she was a gold medallist at the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games—Mr Yair Miller for service to the community through a range of organisations and to interfaith relations—of course, Mr Miller is a leader in the Jewish community on the upper
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore" rel="nofollow">
         North Shore
        </a>
        and in the Australian Jewish community—and Dr Richard Schloeffel for services to medicine in the field of chronic and infectious disease. So I want to congratulate those Bradfield constituents who were justly recognised in the Australia Day Honours List.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, Australia Day saw extensive celebrations in Bradfield. Ku-ring-gai Council organised their usual event at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bicentennial Park
        </a>
        in Pymble, where many new citizens received their Australian citizenship, and it was a very joyous occasion.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsby_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Hornsby Shire Council
        </a>
        similarly organised a citizenship ceremony and community celebrations at Hornsby Park. So, both at Bicentennial Park in Pymble and at Hornsby Park, members of the community were able to enjoy a celebration of Australia Day with all kinds of entertainment, stalls and a genuinely joyous community feeling.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Bicentennial Park in Pymble, Ku-Ring-Gai Council awarded the Ku-Ring-Gai Citizen of the Year award to Dr Zeny Edwards, who has made a very significant contribution over many years. She is an architectural historian, and she has been an advocate in relation to issues like the Ku-Ring-Gai Council heritage committee, the Historic Houses Trust, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         National Trust
        </a>
        and the Eryldene Trust—Eryldene, of course, being the historic home in Gordon. She is originally from the Philippines. She has lived in Australia for many years. She has made a very distinguished contribution as an architectural historian and is very deserving of the award of Ku-Ring-Gai Citizen of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        So Australia Day 2017 was a very happy day in Bradfield, as it was around the country.
