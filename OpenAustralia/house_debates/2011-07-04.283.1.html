       <p>
        Today I wish to congratulate the Tamil Senior Citizens Association on the wonderful achievement of their 20th anniversary on 25 July 2011. The association is based in my electorate of Reid. On this auspicious occasion it is poignant to reflect on the wonderful achievements of the association. The ever-increasing membership is testament to the community spirit and benefits that the association has fostered since 1991, when it began with only 27 members. Today, with over 850 senior members, the Tamil Senior Citizens Association is more important than ever in our community. The association has provided services to improve the quality of life of its members, ranging from cultural and educational to benevolent and social as well as recreational activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also very pleased to learn that the Tamil Senior Citizens Association was recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government, who awarded the association the Seniors Achievement Award for Com­munity Service in March of this year. This award was well-deserved recognition of the outstanding services rendered by the Tamil Senior Citizens Association in diverse fields over the past 20 years. I know the association will continue to build on the important services provided and I wish them all the very best with their endeavours. Congr­atulations again to the president, Mr Shiva Pasupati, and each and every member of the Tamil Senior Citizens Association on the wonderful milestone of the 20th anniversary. I look forward to many more to come.
