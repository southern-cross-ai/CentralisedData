       <p>
        The amazing feats of some of the constituents who call Lindsay home never, ever cease to amaze me. On Sunday we saw one of the most courageous endeavours of endurance and dogged determination by one of the most inspirational men in our community, if not in the country. For 26 years, John Maclean has sat in a wheelchair as a result of a tragic collision with a truck on the M4. John believed he would never walk again. But on Sunday, John rose from his wheelchair and completed the Nepean Triathlon, the oldest triathlon in our country. For a man who has been sitting in a wheelchair for 26 years, he swam one kilometre, rode 30 km on a bike and completed a 10 km walk. John crossed the finishing line holding the hand of his wife and his son, Jackâ€”such an amazing result!
       </p>
       <p>
        John is a man who has never been defined by his ability. He has swum the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , he has written a book, he has competed and won many medals at the

        </a>
        and has even competed in international ironman events. John still focuses on how he can help and inspire other people through his foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        John, you are an inspiration. John, you are a terrific individual and I am so proud that you are a constituent of the electorate of Lindsay. John, you are the embodiment of courage. Thank you for all you have done.
