        This year, 2018, marks the centenary of the end of

         World War I
        </a>
        . In a few months, we'll be gathering at services all around the country to commemorate the centenary of the Armistice. Three organisations in my electorate of Dunkley have been working towards projects to acknowledge the end of the war 100 years ago, drawing on our local heritage and the recognition across the community of the significance of the sacrifices made.

        </a>
        , under the leadership currently of President John Beslee, have been running services at the RSL for years, which have been more and more attended as every year goes by. We now have the police close off Station Street as the crowds spill out onto the streets with so many people now attending. Seaford RSL have received just over $12,500 to go towards their expansion project around the cenotaph area—currently a grassy slope and a small brick courtyard around the cenotaph and flagpoles—to accommodate the growing crowds. I visited Seaford RSL last week to have a look at their ideas and to commend them on this very worthy project.

        Mornington and District Historical Society, under the leadership of President Diane White, have a remarkable collection of historical artefacts—Victorian era clothing, war posters, settler possessions and more—which are on display in the Old Post Office Museum in Mornington. Amongst their collection, they have on display a large amount of memorabilia from the

         First World War
        </a>
        and other conflicts that is currently unable to be all displayed together and with the appropriate dignity that it all deserves. I visited the historical society last week also to look at their plans to purchase a display cabinet, with the $3,150 from the federal government that they have been granted under the Armistice Centenary Grants Program, so that the photographs of soldiers, medals, old coins and more can have their own proper place in the museum and be recognised by the community and those who visit.

        this year at the Frankston War Memorial. We're lucky that the Frankston War Memorial in Beauty Park is a very new memorial. The just over $15,000 we have given through the armistice centenary grant will add a great deal to the beautiful setting that we have. I look forward to visiting Beauty Park again with the veterans to go over their ideas. Congratulations to all recipients, and I look forward to seeing these projects completed in time for the remembrance services on 11 November.
