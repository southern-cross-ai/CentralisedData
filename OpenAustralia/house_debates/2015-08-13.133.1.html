        ) ( ): I rise to congratulate some outstanding young people in my electorate who are excelling in their chosen sport. I know that many of us have had dreams of having a crack at sport at a higher level, but it is often difficult for families to meet the significant financial costs and demands that it entails. I am really pleased to say that, through the government's Local Sporting Champions program, we are enabling young 'coasties' aged 12 to 18 to kick-start their dreams. These grants deliver assistance towards the cost of things like travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment, whether they are competing, coaching or officiating at an official state, national or even international sporting event. It really helps people travelling more than 125 kilometres, as well, with grants up to $500.

        There have been a number of worthy recipients. But in this round there are a number of people from my electorate. We should remember these names, because I dare say they could be people you will see in green and gold in years to come. Among them are three basketball stars: Matthew Kenyon, from

She will receive a grant for her outstanding efforts in track and field. In November, 12-year-old Ashton Hurley, from Terrigal, will fly to Adelaide for the Pacific School Games football tournament. Ashton is a striker—and, who knows, maybe he will be hitting the back of the net for our

        , who had a grant approved after his nomination for the state championships in Wollongong. Jemma Smith achieved nomination to represent Umina Surf Life Saving Club at the Pool Rescue Championships in Queensland. She trains 12 sessions a week. She is a passionate local who deserves this support—support which could one day save a life on one of our Central Coast beaches. Kincumber residents can rightly be proud of Justin Lenkovic after his recent achievements at the National Karate Championships in Adelaide. His grant will help him get a new tracksuit and uniform.

        These are fantastic achievements from young sporties on the Central Coast. We are proud of them all.
