        My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the Deputy Prime Minister’s statements made here today in relation to the Iraqi government welcoming tenders from the Australian wheat industry. Prime Minister, to overcome concerns from wheat growers about the future of the single desk and the unique circumstances surrounding trade with Iraq, is it legally possible for any wheat trading with Iraq during this uncertain period to be done on a government-to-government basis rather than by grain marketers outside the

         Australian Wheat Board
        </a>
        and, hence, maintain the government’s commitment to the single desk? Prime Minister, if it is legally possible, would you consider this as an option to Australia’s current predicament until the review of the Australian Wheat Export Authority is completed?

         I thank the member for New England for the question. We have considered that. I do not think it is a desirable alternative to current arrangements to inject the government into the equation. I do not think I can say more than that. The situation is that pending the outcome of the Cole inquiry—which obviously will bear on the future of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
          AWB
         </a>
         Ltd and not automatically in any way on the future of the single desk policy—the single desk policy must be looked at separately from the future of AWB. There are very strong arguments in favour of maintaining the single desk, and I have no hesitation in repeating that it remains government policy to maintain the single desk. If we were to consider a change in the future, it would be lunacy from the point of view of this country’s national interest for us to give away the single desk unilaterally. It would only ever be something you would contemplate giving away in the context of international trade negotiations. But we have looked at the very point that was raised by the member for New England. Our strong preference—and it will be no surprise to him—being a government that prefers the free enterprise option to a government option, is not to go down that path, and we do not intend to go down that path. But I thank the honourable member for the question. It gives me an opportunity to restate the government’s position.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, as the member for New England invited me to comment on the Deputy Prime Minister’s comments, can I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on the success of his mission to Iraq. He did good things in a difficult environment for the future of the Australian wheat industry. The wheat growers of Australia know that, and the wheat growers of Australia will continue to respect him for it.
