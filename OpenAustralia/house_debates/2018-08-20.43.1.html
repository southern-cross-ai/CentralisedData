        , who's worked in the farm sector for years, knows the pain of some of our older farmers who are almost out of feed for stock and their working animals.

While much of the agricultural land that fed Sydney since the colonial settlements has disappeared under concrete, there's still around 33,000 hectares of farmland in the Hawkesbury, most of it for grazing, and more than 450 businesses in the agricultural sector. We have leading agricultural research being done at the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University.

This is a long drought and people need help.' Thanks to all who donated, but, with no serious rain predicted until autumn, this is likely to be the beginning, not the end, of the help that's needed.
