       <p>
        I want to put on the record my appreciation for the phenomenal Labor candidates who stood in the state seats that make up my federal seat of Chisholm. Given that I live within a sea of blue in the maps, these are candidates who were running in seats that probably they did not have a great prospect of winning, but they still flew the flag and had some phenomenal swings in my neck of the woods.
       </p>
       <p>
        I give a big shout out to Gavin Ryan, in the seat of Burwood, who gave up six months of his job, his life, to campaign tirelessly; and an enormous thanks to Stef Perri, in

        To Steve Dimopoulos, who has won in the seat of Oakleigh, congratulationsâ€”again, a great campaign. Goodbye to
