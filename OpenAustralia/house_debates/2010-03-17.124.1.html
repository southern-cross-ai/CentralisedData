        May I commend the member for Fadden on his speech. I too want to talk about exceptional leadership within my own electorate of Ballarat. This week, the federal parliament has been host to around 30 emerging young leaders from across the Ballarat region. They came to Canberra to form a greater understanding of our nation’s parliamentary system, and of how those involved use different leadership skills when tackling their various roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The young participants, mostly aged in their 20s and 30s, are members of the Leadership Ballarat and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Region" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        program. This is a program of discovery and challenge that uniquely equips young leaders to guide the Ballarat region into the future. Today and yesterday, these young people met with leaders of different political persuasions, as well as members of the press gallery and our Governor-General—and, of course, Mr Speaker, you gave so generously of your time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to share some of the feedback I have received from some of them just in the brief time they were able to do that today. One participant, Sheree, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        gives an insight into the commitment and dedication required to be a successful and effective leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another participant, Jane, commented that aspiring to positions of leadership was a distinctly Australian quality. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is part of our national psyche.
       </p>
       <p>
        Katherine said that her time in Canberra had given deeper insight into the challenges faced by Australian leaders. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Social change doesn’t occur unless people get involved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We cannot sit back and expect others to take care of it for us—we are responsible for participating in the leadership of our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two participants originally from overseas also contributed their perspectives. Mehrdad Razmjoo, known as Mel, is one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ballarat" rel="nofollow">

        ’s multicultural ambassadors. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a Persian Australian I would like to say I am very privileged to live in such a democratic country like Australia without fear of execution, compared to Iran.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was completely blown away about the access he got to members of parliament. He could not imagine such a thing occurring in his home country. Karin, also a multicultural ambassador, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an ex-South African I appreciate the opportunities open to women in Australia to make a difference in a democratic society.
       </p>
       <p>
        And Adam Rogers said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been amazing to have the opportunity to understand that regardless of political views, aspirations or background, parliament is a melting pot of enthusiastic and inspirational leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        These comments are terrific.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leadership, it seems, is best witnessed up close and personal. Many arrived at Parliament House sceptical of politicians and the political process, but many left after a brief two days with an overwhelming confidence in our nation’s democratic process. Sometimes we in this place forget what a special place this is. I certainly thank those young leadership participants for reminding me of that each time they come.
       </p>
       <p>
        To have local community members visit parliament and meet with our nation’s leaders is a wonderful reflection of Australia’s democracy. This is no more apparent than in the comments from our local multicultural ambassadors. The program is a great example of how we can better equip our regional future leaders. I would like to see these types of programs happening across the country as they set out to invigorate regional communities by inspiring people from communities such as mine. We do very well at both the state, federal and local level in terms of our capacity building for regional leadership, but there are other layers that we need to look more closely at as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, I would also personally like to thank all those who have given their time, including the Treasurer; Minister Ferguson; Minister Plibersek; Minister Elliot; the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon.

        . They all gave so generously of their time to all of these young people from Ballarat. It really has been a terrific contribution from the parliament. Each gave of their time and experience generously, and I know the impact on the group was significant and long-lasting.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I also know, from speaking with many of the participants, that this trip will be an inspiration to them to actively engage in the political process and to become our leaders of the future. I hope, for the participants of this year’s leadership program, that over the following weeks, months and years the conversations that they have had over this time will become lasting memories that will assist them in their future challenges and certainly support our region in its challenges for the future.
