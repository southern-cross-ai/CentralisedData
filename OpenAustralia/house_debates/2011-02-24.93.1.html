        , watch an event at the beautifully manicured showground, buy a new outfit at a boutique or just walk the heritage streets. That little town is called Dungog. This little town is now facing the biggest challenge of its existence because of the actions of, and inaction by, our state and federal Labor governments. However, the great thing about challenges is that they present opportunity for growth, and I have no doubt we can emerge stronger than ever with the right support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dungog business and residential community has been in a flux of turmoil since 2006, when the New South Wales Labor government announced plans to build the $477 million

        child sex scandal. It took until November 2010 for the Premier to see sense and cancel the project. This was on the back-end of four years of uncertainty, and a massive campaign spearheaded by the local people. By that time, the state Labor government had already wasted $100 million of taxpayers’ money on the project, jeopardised local investment, and left the town in limbo regarding its future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, the people of Dungog have come together to plan on how best to revitalise their home. Their focus on roads, community infrastructure, employment and tourism is supported by the coalition. Other priorities include ensuring hospital and rail services are retained, and maintaining Dungog’s independent local government status.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was saddened to read that the Dungog Shire Action Initiative felt dismayed after a press conference with Hunter minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_McKay" rel="nofollow">
         Jodi McKay
        </a>
        , in which she suggested the community was not adequately prepared to work towards the revitalisation. Ms McKay must not have spent much time in Dungog. In my time as a federal member, I have found the people to be some of the most sincere and hardworking I have ever encountered. It is a shame Ms McKay had no representative at a community meeting held in Dungog on 15 December, where hundreds of people worked together to discuss a renewal plan and suggested dozens of viable, workable solutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that the state coalition today pledged $20 million to upgrade
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Main Road
        </a>
        301, which is desperately needed to kick-start all other areas of the town’s renewal. It would be a boost for tourism, business and residents. I have always said that when you build a road, you create a highway to opportunity. On behalf of the federal coalition I repledged my own roads package last year, and it remains coalition policy to deliver $20 million to upgrade Main Road 301 and $5 million to fix Main Road 7778-Gresford Road, to be delivered in addition to the state funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Continued health services in the shire are also vital. That is why, after community consultation, I lobbied federal health minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon" rel="nofollow">
         Nicola Roxon
        </a>
        to redirect the $7 million she promised for a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Raymond Terrace
        </a>
        , and instead invest $3m in the HealthOne clinic already planned for Raymond Terrace, with the rest to be split between the Medowie-Salt Ash region and the Dungog area. I urge all residents to register and attend the government’s consultation meeting on 7 March at Raymond Terrace Bowling Club at six o’clock to help convince Ms Roxon to invest in Dungog.
       </p>
       <p>
        Testament to the community’s proactive and resilient nature, residents have not waited for a solution from government. Instead, they have organised a community sporting challenge. The GP Stakes will raise money to attract a new local practising GP. The target fundraising goal of $20,000 has already been reached thanks to the overwhelming generosity of the local community. This should not be necessary. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promised that when it came to health, the buck would stop with him. Despite this, Dungog has lost a GP and residents have had to fund a public campaign to secure a replacement. It is not good enough. The Gillard Labor government needs to start a proper dialogue with the community to get the outcomes it well and truly deserves, and I look forward to working together to achieve the bright future I know is possible. To my Dungog community I say this: you are not forgotten, and you will not be forgotten either by me or by the coalition.
