        I have a confession to make: I have offended the cafe latte set. I have offended them with the comments I made about the artwork here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , much of which I referred to as being appalling. I also offended them when I said that, when it comes to some of the artwork here, perhaps I am missing something because I did not pay attention at art classes in school. I have been subject to hostile abuse from the culturally and morally superior, who join in the groupthink: when they see a piece of contemporary art, they think that they get it and we do not.
       </p>
       <p>
        But they miss the point entirely. Everyone's choice in art is their own personal choice, and if there is anything such as good art it is art that actually gets a reaction, whether positive or negative, and that is exactly what has happened, thankfully, through my comments. The artist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Sharpe" rel="nofollow">
         Wendy Sharpe
        </a>
        —whose work I must admit I admire and who does some wonderful work—following the comments I made about one of her artworks which is hanging in our Parliament House, has had a story about her and her artwork in today's
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
        </i>
        . This is priceless publicity that she has received for her artwork. So I actually look forward to maybe getting a job sometime in the future as her publicist, or maybe even to her slinging me a commission for the priceless publicity I have given her.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second point I would make about art is the opportunities that we are missing here in Parliament House. We have miles and miles and corridors in this Parliament House. We have thousands of foreign tourists visiting this Parliament House. This should be a great opportunity to showcase Australian artwork. I would like to see more Aboriginal artwork hanging here in Parliament House. Let's have more of it here. We have the corridor space. Let's expose it to the foreign tourists that come in. Who knows? Madam Deputy Speaker, I know you have a great appreciation of local artists. Tourists may buy a tie or a scarf or something with an Aboriginal print fabric to take back home. Let's have more of our historical pictures and our artwork telling the story of our nation building. Let's have more pictures of our coastline, our outback and our unique wildlife. These are the opportunities that we have to promote artwork here in our Parliament House. We need to do it. We only have to look at this chamber and some of the wonderful pieces of artwork that are out on display. I have taken the opportunity to go and visit our art department down in the basement. Let's not hide our artwork down there. Let's get it out. Let's get it on display. Let's promote what we have. Let's get in and talk and encourage the arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I apologise to Ms Wendy Sharpe if she has taken any offence. I do admire her artwork and, as I said, I think I have given her priceless publicity. I am looking forward to my commission.
