        Let's make our reef great again. As a child, I grew up watching the yachts in Pittwater, the rock fishermen at Long Reef, surfers and swimmers braving the elements for an early morning dip, and the surf lifesavers that protect our beaches. These are some of my fondest memories from my childhood. For my constituents, this is just everyday life, a life intertwined with the ocean. Since I've taken office, protection of the marine environment has been raised over and over again. To my constituents I say: I've listened and I have heard. Our marine environment is precious and should be protected by every level of government.

        marine park. We are an island nation with over 10 million square kilometres of ocean. We have the third largest marine jurisdiction in the world. Successive Commonwealth governments have worked to establish 60 marine parks in Commonwealth waters alone, representing over 35 per cent of our oceans, the second largest area of marine reserves behind the United States. The science behind these marine parks is unequivocal. We know they can increase the abundance and diversity of organisms and protect threatened and vulnerable species. They allow ecosystems to recover from past natural and human impacts, while protecting these areas into the future.

         The Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        is the crowning jewel in the Commonwealth's network of marine parks, contributing an estimated $6.4 billion to our economy and supporting 64,000 jobs. The protection of the Great Barrier Reef from threats, including crown-of-thorns starfish, increasing sea temperatures and acidity, and water quality issues, is one of the Turnbull government's highest priorities. Faced with these significant challenges, the Turnbull government is investing record funding to research and implement innovative solutions that work to improve the resilience of the reef to these threats. The investment builds on our Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, which has been endorsed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage Committee
        </a>
        and guides our work with the community, scientists, industry and other stakeholders to boost the reef's resilience. As a result of these decisive actions, the World Heritage Committee has removed the reef from the 'in danger' watch list and praised Australia as a global leader in reef management. This investment is designed to spark new and innovative investment in reef protection, delivering on projects which are proven to boost the health of the reef, improve water quality, tackle the crown-of-thorns starfish and work with traditional owners. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest reef systems in the world, and it is vital that we do what we can to protect it and ensure it remains viable for future generations.

        Our marine environments are a precious gift, passed to us by previous generations and loved and enjoyed by millions every day, and therefore they should be safeguarded long into the future. I want to work with all levels of government to ensure these irreplaceable jewels can be preserved for all future generations to enjoy. In July last year, over 200 people in my electorate gathered at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Beach
        </a>
        to recognise the importance of protecting our marine ecosystems. Joined by my state colleague, the Hon. Rob Stokes MP, my constituents were affirming the value of these environments and the lifestyle they enjoy every single day of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coalition governments have a rich tradition as true conservationists because we understand the value of past legacies and intergenerational responsibility. We believe that protecting what is good and great about our country, culture and way of life requires us to make significant investments to safeguard our future. This record investment by the Turnbull government delivers on this commitment to protect this national treasure.
