        government in New South Wales has torn up the longstanding rights of the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park to subdivide their land if they have five acres or to build a dwelling as small as a granny flat to house an elderly resident. The people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park have planned for years based on the existing law.

        I recently held one of my coffees with a pollie in Horsley Park, but there was one issue that people wanted to talk about, and it was this. Plenty of people came down to tell me about their white hot anger with the Berejiklian Liberal government. The fact is they bought these blocks of land years ago with a view to one day subdividing it for their children, and their rights have been ripped away. Charles Borg wrote:

        At some stage in the near future my mother will need to apply for an age pension if she cannot subdivide and sell her land as she does not intend to leave her family home of 52 years.

       <p>
        These are the real-life implications of this arrogant approach by the Liberal Party in New South Wales. And what's been the response of the state Liberal member? She gave a speech in the state parliament attacking me. I couldn't give two hoots what she says about me, because she can say what she likes. I would just like her to do her job and stand up for the people who elected her, the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park.
