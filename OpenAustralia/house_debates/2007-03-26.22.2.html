        I rise this afternoon to talk about the Northcote Cricket Club. On Saturday I was delighted to attend the club’s Centenary Gala Night celebrating 100 years as a premier cricket club. Despite a few name changes and several changes of venue, the Northcote Cricket Club can trace its history back to its origins in the mid-1870s, with the first recorded meeting taking place on 17 July 1875 by one of the district’s pioneers, George Plant.

        The club has a colourful history. Mr Speaker, if you will indulge my pun, it has chalked up a lot of runs on the board, including dismissing an entire team from Preston, which is in another part of my electorate, for just one run. That is a win that even our fine Australian cricket team cannot boast. The club has also fostered new talent who have gone on to earn national selection, including

        To all the members of the Northcote Cricket Club, I say congratulations on 100 years of cricket. You have certainly hit a six for the community. I also acknowledge that you have survived. Other clubs that have produced more internationals, such as Collingwood, Fitzroy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , have gone under during the last 100 years. You are a successful local community organisation, not only producing international and shield cricketers but also giving our young talent an opportunity to actually do something by their local community.
