        Think back to your favourite teacher as a child, the one who had a lifelong impact on the person that you are today. I can think of several, notably the late Bruce Fairfax, who instilled in me a great love of literature and poetry, taught me about the strength of the human spirit and the power of kindness, and gave me a passion for lifelong learning. The evidence shows that, beyond what we learn in an academic sense, schools play a vital role in shaping our character, imparting values such as curiosity, achievement, benevolence and citizenship.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year I've had the great pleasure of getting to know a vibrant, energetic and passionate principal who is dedicated to ensuring the students of his school community are uplifted and know their worth as young citizens.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Gunn" rel="nofollow">
         Jason Gunn
        </a>
        was appointed Principal of Ravenswood Heights Primary School in October last year and from day one has strived to create a school environment which all children and the wider school community can be part of.
       </p>
       <p>
        I grew up in Ravenswood, and I know firsthand the undeserved stigma sometimes associated with the area and the school. Of course, like any area, there are challenges that exist, particularly in relation to socioeconomic disadvantage, but Jason refuses to put these challenges in the too-hard basket and is instead committed to providing all children who walk through the door with a sense of pride and belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a great privilege to be invited to attend school events, and in April I attended a very moving remembrance ceremony at Ravenswood to mark Anzac Day. Bringing together staff, students and family members and featuring a wonderful music and drama presentation, it was without a doubt the best assembly I've ever had the fortune to attend. As Jason said afterwards:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't think I've ever been in a school where I've been so proud of the people in the school and that goes for everyone from our groundsmen to our assistant principal to our teachers and importantly, our students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further expanding on his passion for students to explore the creative arts and to improve their love of learning, Jason engaged street artist KreamArt to work with students to transform part of the school's exterior into their very own creative precinct. The project aims to help kids achieve success through creativity. It features colourful messages and a mural including the school's values of respect, growth and aspiration. I was able to view the finished masterpiece while on my latest visit to the school last week, and it is brilliant. This mural is just the beginning of a whole-school project, with each class from kindergarten through to grade 6 to create their own mural across the school. The school community are throwing their support behind the initiative, which is helping to drive a love of learning and a sense of belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my visit last week, I was also delighted to see the number of wonderful pieces of student work up on display in the corridors of the school. Refusing to accept the rhetoric that artwork should not be displayed as it would only get destroyed, Jason and the teaching staff have filled the hallways with amazing creative pieces which, in no surprise to Jason, have remained untouched.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we know the important role the creative arts play in a child's development, we also understand the significance playgrounds can have on a child's emotional, social, mental and physical wellbeing. Play equipment can also help develop coordination, strength and motor skills, which is why school playgrounds are so important. Unfortunately, Ravenswood Heights has not had the benefit of great play equipment, with the school's grounds having been very sparse for many years. Jason responded quickly to this challenge too, spending his own time out of hours building the school's only sandpitâ€”the first time that some students have ever had the opportunity to play in one inside or outside of the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm grateful that the state education department has now recognised the need of Ravenswood primary, and I understand that funds will be made available for new playground equipment, hopefully this school term. I thank former minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Rockliff" rel="nofollow">
         Jeremy Rockliff
        </a>
        for responding so quickly and positively to my advocacy after Jason raised it with me earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jason has a bold vision to make his school the best in the state, and, with his courage, determination and infectious enthusiasm, he is well on the way to achieving his goal. To the grade 6 leadership students who I had the pleasure of meeting with again last week: I was so impressed by your maturity, your kindness and your passion for the school. A very special thank you to leaders Gypsy and Brody for representing me at one of our local Anzac Day events earlier this year. To Jason and the wonderful Ravenswood Heights teachers and staff: I hope that you never doubt the difference you're making in the lives of your students now and into the future.
