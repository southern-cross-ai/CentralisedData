       <p>
        I spoke in my first speech about the great people I have to represent in Lindsay—our people are actually our strength. This is no different. Last week I was at the Glenmore Park Learning Alliance with some prefects and some local school captains.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was approached by a little girl who is in year 6, Jasmyn Tan. She wanted a selfie—which was fine, because I am quite partial to that. She also wanted a signature—which was a little bit strange because she still has not cottoned on that politicians are not that popular.
       </p>
       <p>
        She wanted to tell me about a haircut. This is a little leader from her school—Leonay Public School. She had read on her mum's Facebook about a little boy in our community, Bryson Kai Miles. He is three years old and he is suffering from a significant brain tumour. Jasmyn was inspired by his story—she had never met him; she had never met his family; she knows nothing about them—and she wanted to help. So she decided that her hair which reaches down to about there—and the member for Fisher and I will probably talk about something we have in common after this—and she wanted to cut all her hair off in support of Bryson and raise money for his family and his parents, Tamara and Grant, so they could support Bryson's journey and offset some of the costs that go along with having a very unwell child.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday this week, while I was in this place and I am able to be there and help with the haircut—which is properly a good thing for Jasmine—she cut all of her hair off. I want to say, 'Thank you, Jasmyn, for your leadership and your compassion' and 'All the very best to Bryson and his family for good recovery.'
