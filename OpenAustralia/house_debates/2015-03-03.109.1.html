       <p>
        Last Friday, Melbourne received some devastating news. Alberto Paulon, a young man who was engaged to be married and was starting a new life in Australia, was killed when an opening car door knocked him off his bike and into the path of a truck. Alberto was on his way to work. This happened on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Road
        </a>
        in Brunswick, an area that until recently was in my electorate. Sydney Road is a narrow road and a major commuting route, where a large and growing number of cyclists ride between parked cars and heavy traffic. I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to Mr Paulon's family and loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now time that we have a serious conversation in Melbourne, and in Australia, about doing what it takes to make cycling safe. Car dooring is probably the biggest threat to cyclists in my electorate. Along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda_Road" rel="nofollow">
         St Kilda Road
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Collins Street
        </a>
        is one of the state's worst dooring black spots. There are over 100 recorded dooring incidents a year in inner Melbourne, but with unreported hits or near misses this is clearly just the tip of the iceberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many drivers may not be aware of the danger posed by car doors. I say now to drivers that we have a responsibility to understand this danger and to take action. Just as we would look while we are reversing because there might be a child behind us, we must look in the mirror when opening a door because it might save a life. There is a simple step that could be taken that would help save lives. One step that all drivers can take is get into the habit of opening their car door with their left hand when they get out. It makes you turn your head, look into the mirror and then potentially see any cyclists approaching behind you. Also, often cyclists will move out onto the road to avoid the so-called door zone. This is done for safety. When passing a cyclist, I encourage drivers to understand that this extra space is needed and to adjust accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as road users must take responsibility so must governments. I joined

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAC" rel="nofollow">
         TAC
        </a>
        style public awareness campaign on the dangers of dooring. There are huge benefits to cycling. It eases congestion and keeps our city moving. It is good for the environment and it is good for health, and it is a great way to get around quickly and cheaply. There is genuine pleasure and freedom in starting the day with the wind bracing you as you ride through the city. We need more people on bikes if Melbourne is to have a sustainable and liveable future.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a massive increase in the number of Melburnians who have gotten on their bikes in recent years as a reflection of all of these benefits. Currently, more than 16 per cent of all vehicles travelling into the central city during the morning peak hour are bikes, exceeding all official predictions from a few years ago. There would be many, many more people who would love to join them if they felt the right infrastructure was in place to keep them safe. So, here, in Australia's parliament I call on governments to invest in a safe and integrated bike lane network that goes where people need to go. When will we finally separate cars from riders and have dedicated, safe and prioritised bike lanes? There has been great work done by local councils in my electorate of Melbourne to push for safe and effective bike routes, with Greens councillors leading the way.

         City of Melbourne

        has been a pioneer in Australia with separated Copenhagen bike lanes on

         Swanston Street
        </a>
        and La Trobe Street. Copenhagen bike lanes simply mean putting the bikes between the parked cars and the footpath rather than making the bikes have to go between the parked cars and the traffic. Council has now budgeted for Copenhagen lanes on other major bike routes—

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">

        and the state government must work with the City of Melbourne to get these lanes built.

         The City

        of Yarra has also been a leader in creating safe and prioritised lanes. Thanks to the activism of community groups and Greens councillors, they will now build fully separated, Copenhagen style lanes on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Wellington Street
        </a>
        in Collingwood—a major commuting route. Still, the state government needs to fix the gaps in the off-road, shared path network in Yarra, including by finally fixing the stairs at Gipps Street on the main Yarra Trail, which governments of both Liberal and Labor persuasions have failed to address, despite bicycle user groups crying out for over a decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Governments, including the federal government, have a responsibility to build good, safe cycling infrastructure. If we make cycling safe and accessible, more and more people will get on their bikes and we will have that critical mass to build the cycling infrastructure we need to create a liveable Melbourne.
