         Committee

        for the 46 parliament, comprising 30 petitions and 19 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. I also present a corrigendum to report No. 22, to correct a typographical error.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week I'm pleased to announce that the House petitions' website has been updated. This update has increased the capacity of the e-petitions system to better handle peaks in user engagement and has improved accessibility and petitioning information more generally. Improvements include: easy English language to explain the petitioning process and rules for petitioning; symbols and imagery to increase accessibility in understanding the petitioning process; an updated and comprehensive frequently-asked-questions page; a streamlined process for creating paper e-petitions, with improved guidance at each step; and enhanced web design and navigational tools so that users can easily find what they're looking for. The committee trusts that this update will assist citizens when engaging with the petitioning process, making it easier for them to sign, curate and learn about petitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Speaker. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the committee.
