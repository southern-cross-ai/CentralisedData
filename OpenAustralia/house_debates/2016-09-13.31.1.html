        It is with great pleasure that I report to the House a fantastic night of fun and frivolity last Wednesday at the Albany Entertainment Centre. This year's Albany District Primary Music Teachers' Network's music festival was hosted by

        </a>
        and, last but by no means least, the school that my youngest kids attend, Albany Primary School.
       </p>
       <p>
        My favourite individual school act for the evening was Flinders Park Primary School's performance of the old Beatles classic

        , where music teacher Mike Staude had every single student in the ensemble playing an instrument. However, the highlight was undoubtedly the combined school choir's resounding rendition of

        </i>
        , where every child who had performed on the evening came together in an ensemble of more than 400 voices in perfect harmony.
       </p>
       <p>
        My hearty thanks to Flinders Park Primary School principal, Richard Bushell, and his team for hosting a wonderful concert. Congratulations to each of the students who performed with pride and confidence in front of a full house. As a parent of one of the performers, I can honestly say how proud I was of not only my daughter but of every single student as they sang their little hearts out for their teachers, families and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, a big shout out to the Albany music teachers' network for their hard work and professionalism in preparing their students for this wonderful evening. I would like to single out Robyn Wilson, of

        , who is retiring after 19 years, and acknowledge her years of commitment to cultivating the musical talents of so many young students. I am sureâ€”
