        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a proud heritage in health and medical research, which I am sure we all on both sides of the House support. Australian health professionals, scientists and academics have helped to improve the quality of life of millions of people in Australia and throughout the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since September 1936, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
         National Health
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Medical Research Council
        </a>
        (otherwise known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
         NHMRC
        </a>
        ) has played a pivotal role in funding and supporting health and medical research in Australia. The NHMRC’s role, responsibilities and functions were eventually enacted through legislation in 1992.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1999, the government undertook to increase annual funding for health and medical research through the NHMRC from $165 million in 1998-99 to more than $350 million in 2004-05. Further, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced on 21 March 2006 that the Australian government will provide a further $9.8 million for health research into chronic diseases, Indigenous health and the recovery process of older Australians who have been hospitalised. This brings the federal government’s investment in health and medical research through the NHMRC to more than $490 million this year, more than double the 1999 figure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The council has provided high quality advice on medical research, health ethics and health. A number of recent reviews have, however, identified governance concerns. These are:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the
         <i>
          Governance of the

           National Health and Medical Research Council
          </a>
         </i>
         report published by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian National Audit Office
         </a>
         in February 2004; and
        </li>
        <li>
         the
         <i>
          Sustaining the virtuous cycle for a healthy, competitive Australia: investment review of health and medical research—final report
         </i>
         published by the Investment Review of Health and Medical Research Committee in December 2004.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In response, this bill improves the NHMRC’s corporate governance, including reporting and accountability frameworks, congruent with the principles of good governance as adopted by the Australian government in 2003 following the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders by Mr John Uhrig
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proposed that, from 1 July 2006, the NHMRC be established as a statutory agency for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999 and as a prescribed agency under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Financial Management
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        1997.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new agency will remain within the Health and Ageing portfolio, with reporting and accountability frameworks that clearly separate the NHMRC roles and functions from those of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . The bill’s provisions strengthen the NHMRC’s independence, promote clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability and allow the council to focus on issues relating to medical and biological research and advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previously, the NHMRC’s chief executive officer has had a cumbersome accountability framework with three concurrent lines of reporting, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the Minister for Health and Ageing
        </li>
        <li>
         the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and
        </li>
        <li>
         the council itself.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Under this bill, the chief executive officer will report directly to the Minister for Health and Ageing, while keeping the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing informed on a ‘no surprises’ basis. These changes will provide the NHMRC with clearer delineation of responsibility and accountability in management, advice and strategic development. The NHMRC will retain its name and will include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , staff, council, principal committees and working committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the accountability and reporting structure has been streamlined, the roles and functions of the council, the principal committees and working committees have not been altered. The council will continue to provide independent expert advice and inquire into medical research and health related issues, including issuing guidelines and advising the government and community on matters relating to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the improvement of health;
        </li>
        <li>
         the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease;
        </li>
        <li>
         the provision of health care;
        </li>
        <li>
         public health research and medical research; and
        </li>
        <li>
         ethical issues relating to health.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The proposed legislation prescribes that membership of the council consist of 19 members, with provision for additional expert members as required from time to time. Whilst this represents a reduction from the current 29 council members, requirements for appointments, including qualifications and experience, remain largely unaltered. This will enable the council to be more effective whilst retaining its high level of expertise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The administrative requirements for appointment processes have also been streamlined. Whereas previously it has taken up to eight months to complete some appointments, more effective consultation and administrative processes will help to ensure appointments can be made in an efficient and timely manner. The term for council membership will continue to be three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new agency will be financially autonomous, with direct appropriations, and the CEO will be responsible and accountable for the financial and day-to-day operations of the agency. As the biotechnology, health and medical industries in Australia continue to strengthen and grow, the provisions included in this bill will enable the NHMRC to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         be more responsive to emerging health priorities and issues;
        </li>
        <li>
         explore innovative collaborations and industry joint ventures; and
        </li>
        <li>
         provide greater transparency and accountability in its operations.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The research committee will continue to recommend funding for research proposals and monitor the use of research funding. The research committee, as with all principal committees of the agency, will report to the CEO on operational and financial matters, but will report to council on technical matters concerning health and medical research.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will not affect the level of funding the government has allocated for health and medical research, but provides for a more effective, efficient, accountable and responsive agency. These changes will see the NHMRC better placed to operate as a leader in Australia’s internationally recognised health and medical research sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.

         , Territories and Roads for standing in for the Minister for Health and Ageing. Whilst it is not like me to be generous to the minister for health, I think perhaps the House could note that he is in attendance at the National Palliative Care Week function, particularly the launch of Parents in Care, which is an important event and one that I had intended to be at myself but for the unfortunate clash that the

          </small>
          <p>
           Thank you. As the minister has outlined, the purpose of this bill is to amend the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
            National Health
           </a>
           and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Medical Research Council
           </a>
           Act 1992 to introduce new governance arrangements and to clarify accountability and reporting functions for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
            National Health and Medical Research Council
           </a>
           . These new arrangements will establish the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
            NHMRC
           </a>
           as a statutory agency. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the primary functions of the agency and will report to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Previously the council of the NHMRC was responsible for both governance matters and expert scientific advice. The new division of responsibility will allow the council to focus on expert scientific advice whilst the chief executive officer will have day-to-day responsibility for the operation of the agency.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the minister has outlined, the proposed changes also streamline the reporting lines of the chief executive officer and the council. The previous arrangement with the NHMRC having three concurrent lines of reporting obviously added complexity to the arrangements. Those three lines of reporting were to the minister, to the Secretary of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Health and Ageing
           </a>
           and to the council itself. This bill provides for the chief executive officer to report directly to the minister while keeping the secretary informed. Those streamlined arrangements have much to recommend them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments enacted in this bill address the governance issues identified in four major reviews:
           <i>
            Sustaining the virtuous cycle for a healthy, competitive Australia: investment review of health and medical research
           </i>
           , better known as the Wills report, which was published in December 2004;
           <i>
            Governance of the National Health and Medical Research Council
           </i>
           , which was an audit report from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
            Australian National Audit Office
           </a>
           in February 2004;
           <i>
            Review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders
           </i>
           , better known as the Uhrig report, which was published in June 2003; and
           <i>
            Investment review of health and medical research
           </i>
           , better known as the Grant review, which was published in December 2004. These changes which are incorporated in this bill were outlined in a media release from the Minister for Health and Ageing on 7 September 2005.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is interesting to note that, given all of these reports have been around for some time—the most recent of them being in December 2004, which, as we would all know, is some time ago—clearly the minister has been no hurry to make the changes. These changes are claimed by the government to—and this statement was made in the second reading speech:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           ... strengthen the NHMRC’s independence, promote clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability and allow the council to focus on issues relating to medical and biological research and advice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given this is the claim made for the bill and these matters are important, it seems that it would have been better if the government, and in particular the minister for health, had brought forward this legislative change far more quickly than leaving it to this stage of 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, both the second reading speech and the minister’s media release from September last year highlight the need for the NHMRC to build better links with business to improve investment in research and to explore industry joint ventures. So, beyond the governance arrangements, the statements made in support of the bill have included statements about the need for the NHMRC to build better links with business. Labor is very supportive of the need for more industry support for research and development. We are very supportive of the building of better links with business. We certainly need to see better translational research, but we would be concerned if this is a foundation stone for the government at some point in the future—and I acknowledge it would be some point in the future—seeking to withdraw levels of government support which otherwise would have flowed on the basis that private funds have gone in to meet that gap. We obviously want to see the government keeping up effort in this area and private sector involvement being on top of that. I will come to the specific issue of the recent budget and the allocations to health and medical research a little bit later, but I make that comment in the context of the longer term.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the same time that the bill was introduced, the government also introduced the

            Amendment Bill 2006
           </a>
           , which takes a very heavy-handed approach to the Australian Research Council, abolishing the board and the council’s ability to conduct inquiries into national research issues and make decisions about the effective use of research funds. There is a concern that this will lead to even more examples than those that are already known of and on the public record, where the Minister for Education, Science and Training has objected to funding for specific projects. So we are very concerned about what is happening to the Australian Research Council and the possibility of even further party political style ministerial intervention into research projects.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are very strongly supportive of the Australian Research Council’s independence and, given that this bill was introduced at the same time as the bill dealing with the Australian Research Council, we think it is very important to make the point at this stage that Labor would be very deeply concerned about any similar attempt with respect to the National Health and Medical Research Council. We do not contend that this bill about the National Health and Medical Research Council is such an attempt to enable political interference by the minister in the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council but, given the way in which the government is going with the Australian Research Council, we think it is important to indicate our concerns about that direction of government policy at this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor will be supporting this bill, but we do have some concerns about it and about the willingness of the Howard government to invest in the incredibly important research efforts that are funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Our concerns go to the following areas. First, we have concerns about the membership of the council. We oppose the removal of the requirement that membership of the council must include ‘an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues, a person with expertise in the trade union movement, a person with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services and a person with expertise in environmental issues’. We recommend that the requirement for these various areas of expertise remain and that the legislation make it clear that multiple categories of expertise may be found in individuals on the council.
          </p>
          <p>
           Put simply, we do not think that there has been sufficient explanation as to why the removal of these particular categories of appointment to the council is warranted. We think these categories are worthwhile ones to make sure that the council has available to it that broad depth of expertise. We note, of course, that given the Howard government’s hatred of the trade union movement and its policy bent of making sure the trade union movement is destroyed in this country—notwithstanding that free trade unions are fundamental to any democracy—we are not surprised to see the removal of the category of a person with expertise in the trade union movement, but all of these categories have been removed. They ought not to have been removed and we would certainly be recommending to the government that they be reincluded.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whilst we support the inclusion of expertise in ethics, particularly in medical research, we seek clarification from the government as to whether the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee is a member of the new council, as is the case at present. The legislation deals with having a person with specific expertise in ethics relating to research involving human beings. We want to know whether the satisfaction of that requirement will be that the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee will be a member of the council. So we have concerns about the membership of the council.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly, we have concerns with and are opposed to the removal of the need for the federal health minister to consult with state and territory health ministers before appointing the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. The bill now requires ‘consulting appropriately’—that is a quote from the bill itself—but it does not contain a definition of what this might mean, nor any means of certifying that the consultation has been done. So there is a reference to consulting appropriately but no content as to with whom you need to consult or how you need to evidence that that consultation has been done. In our view, this undermines the principle that the NHMRC should be at arm’s length from government and a body that has broad acceptability and responds to national interests rather than those of the particular federal health minister in question.
          </p>
          <p>
           Appointments should always be made on the basis of merit and there should be a formal process in place to ensure that this occurs. This is of course a point that would endure without depending on the political complexion of the government at the time. I think Australians have a right to be assured that appointments to bodies like the NHMRC are not being made on a party political basis. One of the ways of ensuring that is to make sure that there is consultation between the federal government and state and territory governments so that a variety of views are put and that you are getting people on the NHMRC who are respected across the board—respected nationally and respected across the levels of government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our third concern is in the area of disclosure of interests. We note that the minister is not required to be advised if a member of the council has disclosed an interest. We consider it the responsibility of the minister to know if a member or members disclose an interest. We regard this as a basic accountability issue, not an administrative task as noted in the schedule prepared by the department for the bill. Of course, accountability has not been a strong suit of the Howard government. We certainly do not want to see any repeats of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gerard" rel="nofollow">
            Robert Gerard
           </a>
           appointment, where a responsible minister—in this case the Treasurer—can stand up in this House and say, on a matter that would cause concern about accountability, that he did not believe it was his job to check, which is what he said in this House. He simply did not believe it was his job to check. He does not believe that encompassed in his duties as Treasurer is the need to check on the veracity of qualifications and any issues that might arise when you are making an appointment like the Robert Gerard appointment. We are worried that this bill institutionalises a minister not knowing, not checking and not caring, and that is not good enough on accountability matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the question of accountability, we further believe—and we note in this regard the advice of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee—that the altered reporting arrangements raise some accountability issues. We agree with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVCC" rel="nofollow">
            AVCC
           </a>
           recommendation that the bill should be amended to enable expert advice to be provided directly to the minister. So that is a further accountability issue.
          </p>
          <p>
           We would also raise—particularly I suppose this week, of all weeks, though the issue is of ongoing and deep concern to us each and every day—the question of Indigenous health and, consequently, Indigenous health research. We acknowledge the inappropriateness of defining particular research priorities for the NHMRC, but we indicate that we would be concerned if the proposed restructure has the result of diminishing the capacity of the NHMRC to strategically respond to the serious problems of Indigenous health. As we know,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           in this country still have an average life expectancy of 20 years less than the rest of Australia. That continues to be a source of national tragedy and something that we all need to be focused on. We would be concerned if there was a withdrawal of effort in the area of Indigenous health research.
          </p>
          <p>
           We note that significant progress has been made in the area of Indigenous health research in recent times through the involvement of members with Indigenous expertise working across the current committee structure. We certainly would not want to see that good work come to an end as a result of restructured arrangements.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is our list of concerns about these new arrangements. They are not sufficient to stop Labor supporting the bill, but we do think that there is considerable food for thought there for the government. Some of them are matters about which the minister could offer a reassurance in dealing with this bill. Some matters require further legislative change. But we believe they should be seriously considered by the Howard government.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are all aware of the value of biomedical research to this country. The NHMRC is Australia’s primary funder of biomedical research and development. In 2005-06 the NHMRC provided $447 million for health and medical research. A recent Access Economics report clearly found that support for biomedical research is one of the best investments our nation can make in the wellbeing of our people. The report states:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           ... the ... returns from health R&amp;D are so extraordinarily high that the payoff from any strategic portfolio of investments is enormous.
          </p>
          <p>
           And:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Health R&amp;D must be seen as an investment in wellness with exceptional returns.
          </p>
          <p>
           Historically, Australian health research and development give an annual average return of $5 for every $1 spent on research and development. This can be as high as $8 for cardiovascular research and development and $6 for respiratory research and development.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Access Economics report found that, despite the additional funding flowing as a consequence of the 1999 Wills review, continued boosts to investment in health research and development relative to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           are warranted, given Australia’s poor ranking relative to other
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           countries. As this nation ages and the dependency ratio increases and health spending rises, breakthroughs in research and development are seen as the best way to address the challenge inherent in the cost and impact of chronic disease.
          </p>
          <p>
           The investment review of health and medical research, the Grant review, recommended that the government continue to invest and build on the Wills funding by increasing federal government investment in health and medical research to $1.8 billion by 2008-09, bringing Australia up to the OECD average level of investment of 0.2 per cent of GDP. A key finding of the Grant report was that the government investment through the Wills funding package had already started to deliver results and that further increases in funding for health and medical research will yield similarly considerable health benefits and economic dividends.
          </p>
          <p>
           We do know that Australian researchers are finding life increasingly difficult. A December 2005 paper in the
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Journal_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Medical Journal of Australia
            </a>
           </i>
           highlighted the extent of researcher dissatisfaction with funding and the inadequacy of infrastructure support. It is not surprising, but indeed very disturbing, that so many of our best scientists are attracted overseas and stay there.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are concerned in this context that, while there is additional investment in medical research, the budget actually represents a lost opportunity. We believe that the Howard government has no real future strategy for health and medical research. Whilst the Treasurer talks about the need to cut health spending to address the ageing population, he does not seem to appreciate the wise words of the Grant report.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, we have seen in the post-budget period the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Ageing big-noting themselves, in this place and outside, about the funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council that is in the budget. But when you actually work your way through the budget papers you can see that, in contrast to this big-noting, there is a huge opportunity missed here to make a real difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has announced $905 million in research funding in the budget. But let us look at where this funding comes from and when it will be spent. If you do that, the package is considerably smaller than the $905 million that is being boasted about by this arrogant government. Only $590.7 million in funding is provided in the four years from 2006-07 to 2009-10, the four years normally in the budget papers—$215 million is provided in 2005-06 and $99.3 million is provided for the five years beyond July 2010. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be familiar with the fact that, when governments want to pump numbers, they engage in these kinds of devices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of the total funding package of $900 million, $670 million is provided due to the decision to sell
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private" rel="nofollow">
            Medibank Private
           </a>
           . Labor simply do not agree that $670 million of funding for health and medical research should be made contingent on the sale of Medibank Private. We are opposed to the sale of Medibank Private. The arguments that have been put in support of the sale are completely spurious, particularly the argument that the sale of Medibank Private will increase competition in the private health insurance industry. This does not pass the laugh test. If the government sells Medibank Private as a going concern, at the end of the sale we will have exactly the same number of private health insurers. If the government breaks Medibank Private up into parts, and allows existing private health insurers to buy those parts, then we will have fewer private health insurers available in the market. Either way, there is no way one can assert that competition will be increased by the sale of Medibank Private. We are opposed to the sale of Medibank Private and we are most certainly opposed to anything as important as health and medical research funding being made contingent on the sale of Medibank Private.
          </p>
          <p>
           While the government is yet to explain where the $215 million to be provided in 2005-06 comes from, we are afraid that this apparent largesse comes at the expense of current health programs that were not delivered. We know across the Health and Ageing portfolio that there are programs that are littered with underspends due to incompetence in delivery by the current government. We do not think that you can claim it as a great advance to collect up that underspent money and rebadge it as money for health and medical research.
          </p>
          <p>
           In any event, the spend in the budget, which is described as being a response to the Grant review, is dramatically less than that recommended by the review. The review recommended that the NHMRC budget rise to $1.8 billion by 2008-09. We are certainly not going to achieve that. Indeed, the funding in the budget package will mean that by 2009-10 NHMRC research funding will be $664 million—that is, only one-third of what has been recommended by the Grant review.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are also concerned, as I indicated earlier, that the government may in the long term be seeking to substitute, for government effort, effort from the private sector. We believe in partnering with the private sector but certainly not in private sector money being used to substitute for what ought to properly be government effort in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generally, the failure to invest in our research capabilities is yet another example of the Howard government squandering our national resources and failing to build our skills base. The Australian community supports increased health and medical research efforts. Research Australia’s annual health and medical research public opinion polls in 2003-04 showed that most Australians wanted to see increased government and industry investment and are prepared to contribute to that investment themselves. In fact, 47 per cent of Australians said they would rather see surplus government funds invested in health and medical research rather than in tax cuts—a rather selfless approach.
          </p>
          <p>
           Securing a strong, enduring, sustainable economic future for Australia requires a long-term view for building on the valuable investment to date. This will only be achieved by a continued focus and leadership by government in partnership with researchers, industry and the community. Government commitment to the recommendations of the Grant review would be a good first step towards showing this leadership. If the additional needed investments in biomedical research come only as a consequence of the sale of Medibank Private, then that simply is not good enough and it demonstrates only too clearly the cynicism of the Howard government, its lack of commitment to biomedical research and its failure to make real investments in Australia’s future.

               Amendment Bill 2006
              </a>
              so that he may respond to some of the concerns the opposition expressed in the amendment moved by the member for Lalor. The member for Lalor talked about the value of medical research. I do not think there is much debate between members of this parliament on the value of medical research with respect to the benefits not only to individuals’ wellbeing but also economically. Similarly, medical workforce issues are affected by medical research. A nation like Australia should not be in a position where we have to import doctors and medical professionals. Representatives from the six states and the two territories are travelling around different countries of the world, competing against each other, to get foreign trained doctors into this country. The opposite should be the case. We should be in a position to export doctors to the rest of the world. I think we should use quite a substantial portion of our aid budget to train doctors for countries that desperately need medical practitioners.
             </p>
             <p>
              The purpose of this bill is to amend the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
               National Health and Medical Research Council
              </a>
              Act 1992 for the purpose of introducing better governance arrangements and clarifying the accountability and reporting functions of the National Health and Medical Research Council, or the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
               NHMRC
              </a>
              , under that act. These amendments are not ad hoc changes. They are considered and thoughtful. They address governance issues identified by three major reviews in the past few years, but they go further than fixing the perceived problems. The amendments also aim to implement opportunities identified in those reviews, opportunities for improving health and medical research outcomes through a more accountable and independent council. This bill is aimed at strengthening the independence and accountability of the NHMRC. It clarifies the reporting lines of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
               CEO
              </a>
              and the council and replaces the previously cumbersome accountability framework, which had three concurrent lines of reporting.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am pleased to see the minister has entered the chamber to answer the concerns raised in the member for Lalor’s amendment, which I am sure he will do at the conclusion of my comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              Currently, financial responsibility and operational accountability are divided. This bill clearly aligns accountability and responsibility. It makes the CEO fully responsible for the overall daily operation and administrative governance of the agency and has him or her reporting directly to the Minister for Health and Ageing while still keeping the secretary to the department informed. This enables the council to focus its full energy on providing expert medical and biological research and advice.
             </p>
             <p>
              While the accountability and reporting structure has been streamlined, the roles and functions of the council, the principal committees and the working committees have not been altered in any way. The new agency will remain within the Health and Ageing portfolio but with reporting and accountability frameworks that clearly separate the NHMRC roles and functions from those of the department. It will be financially autonomous and the bill in no way affects the level of funding allocated for health and medical research, as was proven by the recent budget. This bill does reduce the size of the council from 29 to 19 members. However, this in no way reduces the breadth and depth of the council’s expertise. In fact, council members themselves have acknowledged problems with the current council size and no member has put forward any concerns regarding the proposed changes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Established in 1936, the NHMRC is Australia’s leading expert body responsible for raising the standard of individual and public health. It does this by fostering health, medical research and training and by monitoring ethical issues relating to health throughout Australia. The NHMRC has an internationally recognised reputation for medical research, and these amendments are designed to keep Australian medical and health research among the world’s best.
             </p>
             <p>
              Australians should be proud of what the government and the NHMRC have achieved in the past and aim to achieve in the future. Australian health professionals, scientists and academics have helped to improve the quality of life of millions of people not just in Australia but throughout the world. The council looks at not just ways of curing disease or controlling symptoms but prevention and minimising the long-term impact of disease for the person and for society. This is particularly important when we have an ageing population with increasing longevity. While we are living longer, many of us do so with chronic problems such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While the research undertaken through the NHMRC may not cure those problems, it can help people to control and manage them, enabling us to continue to lead active and productive lives instead of becoming invalids and possibly needing high care.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government recognises that the work of the council is important to our personal and national wellbeing. This was evidenced in March this year, when the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a $9.8 million boost for health research into chronic diseases, Indigenous health and the recovery process of older Australians who have been hospitalised. These are all important to the long-term health and wealth of our communities. As the minister said when he announced this funding boost:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The Federal Government’s investment in health and medical research through the NHMRC is more than $490 million this year, more than double the 1999 figure. Australia is a world leader in health and medical research—on a per capita basis, our research output is twice the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
               OECD
              </a>
              average.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is more. This government is doing even better. In the recent budget, the Treasurer announced an additional $905 million for Australian health and medical research as a major investment in our future health. On top of the $200 million extra over seven years announced in the last budget, this year’s budget committed an additional $500 million over four years for research grants provided through the NHMRC.
             </p>
             <p>
              On top of that extra $500 million to the NHMRC, the budget also provided $170 million over nine years to establish a new health and medical research fellowship scheme, which will allow Australia to attract and retain world-class researchers, which, of course, is also important to our scientific and economic wellbeing. The budget also provided a further $235 million in grants for a number of medical research facilities, to expand research in areas such as cancer and neuroscience.
             </p>
             <p>
              As you can see, this government is very serious about health and medical research being done in Australia. It is not surprising that industry has also benefited from our strong position in medical research. Since 1992 it is estimated that the commercialisation of health and medical research has created over 350 companies and 3,000 to 4,000 new knowledge based jobs. As Senator Kemp said in his speech on the bill in another place:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The NHMRC has performed a pivotal role in supporting such research and fostering talented researchers in these fields.
             </p>
             <p>
              What this means for Australia is that, in supporting the work of the NHMRC, we are benefiting not only from the health and research outcomes but also from the development and retention of scientific expertise in Australia and from the subsequent development of facilities and industries supporting both the research and its end product. Because this research is important to Australia, it is important that it be managed well. That is what this bill is about—good governance which still allows the council to have scientific independence and flexibility. I commend the bill to the House.

               and to thank both the member for Lalor and the member for Fairfax for their contributions. I particularly thank the member for Fairfax for putting on the record in this place some of the achievements of the government in the field of health and medical research.

               This is actually quite a simple bill. It implements the administrative recommendations of the Grant and Wills review of health research funding programs. The essence of that review was that the

                National Health and Medical Research Council

               needed to be made more clearly independent of government and, while the

                NHMRC
               </a>
               will certainly be reporting to the minister, and while the government will certainly be funding this organisation, some of the lack of clarity in who was reporting to whom will be dealt with by this bill. Of course, the other half of the Grant and Wills review recommendations was a very large increase in National Health and Medical Research Council funding. I am pleased to say that, as a result of the budget, that has now been substantially delivered.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think we can say that, while it has taken some time for the recommendations of the Grant and Wills review to be fully implemented, they have now been substantially implemented. I know that both of those two gentlemen are very happy not only with the NHMRC governance changes which this bill implements but with the very large increases in research funding which the government announced in the budget.
              </p>
              <p>
               I should just briefly respond to the second reading amendment that has been moved by the Manager of Opposition Business. I accept that, had this amendment been moved prebudget, there may well have been some justification for it, but I think that it is wholly unjustified subsequent to the budget announcements.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a suggestion in the member for Lalor’s amendment that there may be some problem with future appointments to chair the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I am not in a position, at this time, to announce the new chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, but I can certainly assure the member for Lalor and the House that the new appointment will be someone of impeccable credentials and long and distinguished service in this area. I can also assure the House and the member for Lalor that the incoming
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
                Chief Executive Officer
               </a>
               of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Professor Warwick Anderson, is an absolutely outstanding scientist and an absolutely outstanding administrator. He was in fact offered an equivalent position in a country which is normally regarded as rather larger and more important than Australia, but he declined that offer to take up the position of Chief Executive Officer of Australia’s NHMRC.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think that we have long been extremely well served by our health and medical researchers. I think that not only Australia but the wider world has been immeasurably improved by the work of Australian medical researchers, stretching back 100 years or so. It is impossible to fully estimate just how many tens if not hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been saved because of the work stemming from the research of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Florey" rel="nofollow">
                Howard Florey
               </a>
               . And while he is, justly, the most famous Australian medical researcher of all time—the Bradman, if you like, of medical research—there have been many others in the past and there are many today who are carrying on that fine tradition, and I hope they are somewhat assisted by the measure that I trust the House will shortly pass.

                The original question was that the bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lalor has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
