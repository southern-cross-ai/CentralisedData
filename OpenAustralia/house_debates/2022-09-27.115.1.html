        A small stone was cast today into the great lake that is our nation, and its ripples will be felt for generations going forward. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        , there were 73,000 people last year that wanted to work but did not even look for work because they could not make the cost of child care work for them. This government has followed through on its promise to the Australian people to introduce cheaper child care. It brings me great joy to say that almost 5,600 families in my electorate will benefit from this bill. Five thousand, six hundred families will have access to affordable child care. Five thousand, six hundred families will not be left with a partner considering whether it is even worth going to work when the fees for child care are exorbitant. Five thousand, six hundred families will be enabled and empowered to fully participate in the workforce of their industry and be considered for promotions that require full-time work; they may even go back to study to get a better job that makes them happier and enables a better life. Five thousand, six hundred families will be assisted with the cost of living, enabling them to keep their hard-earned pay and have it accessible to them for whatever they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am passionate about the lives of all Australians being made better. Under this government, no Australian will be left worse off.

        Early education pays dividends. The earlier this government can implement access to child care, the sooner families are able to get ahead. The sooner our children are school-ready, the sooner our nation will benefit from their contribution, because of this policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also makes strides towards closing the gap in an area where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        children are going backwards: school-readiness. Currently, only 4.3 per cent of children in early education are First Nations children, despite being 6.1 per cent of the population aged zero to five. It is not good enough for this country to have its mothers having to decide between affordably caring for their children, or going to work to provide for their family and contribute to the workforce. This government believes in both, and this bill enables that. By increasing the hours that First Nations children are eligible for subsidised child care from 24 to 36, this government says: 'It's no longer one or the otherâ€”you can both afford to have access to child care and go to work,' because, with more First Nations children having access to early education, we're setting them up to have opportunity and benefit for the rest of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you know, I moved to this country to give my children access to better education and a better life. I know that mothers, fathers, grandparents and carers would move mountains for their children. We would do anything for our kids. And I also know how difficult it is to not provide what is adequate for our children. I lived it. Hunger can keep you awake at night. Stress and guilt can keep you awake at night. But I am very proud to say that, tonight, I will sleep so much better knowing that this government has delivered for one million families across the country and for 5,600 families in my electorate of Tangney.
