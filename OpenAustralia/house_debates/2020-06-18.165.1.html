        This Sunday is the motor neurone disease Blue Cornflower Day, and I'm wearing a blue cornflower today. I pay tribute to the 2,100 people living with motor neurone disease in Australia today, and the 14 more that are diagnosed each week. I want to thank the member for Mitchell for raising awareness around

        in Alice Springs. He served as principal of the Ngukurr and Minyerri schools. And he's fondly remembered for his contribution as a teacher at O'Loughlin Catholic College in Darwin. In 2008 he started the tradition of the Big Bike Ride in which students, teachers and parents ride to raise funds for charities. The causes have included breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and MND, which Mike rode in a year after his MND diagnosis. I pay my respects to Mike and I honour his example to all of us.

        I'd like to bring to the attention of the House that young Territorian Morgana Garland is running a marathon for MND this Sunday in Alice Springs, in honour of her mum, Margarita, who departed last month after a two-year fight with MND. You can follow her on Facebook at @MogRunsForMND and you can support her on the Australia Moves for MND site. Just search for Morgana on that website and you'll find her. Whether we're running, donating or praying, I invite all Australians to keep people with MND in their hearts on Sunday.
