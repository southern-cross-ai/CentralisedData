       <p>
        by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Clause 2, page 2 (line 1), omit item 4 from the table (commencement of Schedule 3).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 3, page 6 (line 1) to page 8 (line 31), omit the Schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments regard the changes to the disability support pension. These are amendments that will have the effect of removing schedule 3. Schedule 3, which requires people with disabilities to prove their incapacity to work by participating in training or work related activity before they are assessed as eligible for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
         DSP
        </a>
        , is deeply problematic for a number of reasons. Firstly, individuals who are assessed to have a severe impairment which prevents them from working are not required to complete a program of support. However, the method for determining severe impairment does not account for co-morbidity or cumulative conditions. To be judged to have a severe impairment a person must be assigned an impairment rating of 20 points or more under a single impairment table. This means that a person with co-occurring disorders will not be classified as having a severe impairment unless one or both of the disorders rate above 20 under a single table. This is concerning as the impact of co-occurring disorders can be very severe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the proposed legislation, people suffering from co-occurring disorders who are not judged to have a severe impairment will not be put straight onto the disability support pension. They will most likely be placed on Newstart and yet be unable to meet the requirements of participation in a program of support. What we have found in looking at this bill is that it is very difficult to fully evaluate concerns relating to severe impairment when not only are the revised tables not completed yet but the progress of the current review has not been made public.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a lot of ambiguity in this bill, and it has raised many concerns with those in the sector and amongst my constituents. When this bill was originally tabled, we received hundreds of calls in my electorate and elsewhere from concerned constituents about how it would impact on them and their loved ones. In particular, it is unclear what the maximum amount of time is a person could wait before being reassessed for disability support. According to the government, programs of support will generally last 18 months, but this is not in the legislation. Considering the impact of these measures on people with disabilities, such ambiguity is unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no time limit in the legislation and the length of participation would appear to be at the discretion of the government. It is unclear whether providers will be required to contribute to the disability support pension qualification assessment and what the nature of this contribution might be. This is an important issue. If providers become gatekeepers for the DSP it could impact on their relationship with their clients and their willingness to disclose information. It is unclear how and when a reassessment for the disability support pension will take place. There is ambiguity around how long people will be on programs of support, what criteria will be used to assess and if and when people will be reassessed to go on the DSP.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent numbers could not be provided by the government during the course of the Senate committee's inquiry on how many people would eventually be placed on the DSP after initially being rejected. Figures later provided by the department differed from those provided earlier without clear justification. Essentially, this bill unnece­ssarily subjects people with disabilities to financial hardship for an extended period of time. It is a cost-saving measure designed to keep people off the disability support pension and make them try to survive on Newstart.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Bill
        </a>
        would deprive the majority of applicants (those with low employment prospects who still have an ongoing need for income support) of additional income to help them meet their basic living expenses. At $237 per week for a single adult, the Newstart Allowance is inadequate to pay for the essentials of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        They go on to say that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given that most people with disabilities face additional costs (for example, transport or medications), and will incur additional costs while participating in a ‘program of support’ (for example travel costs), it is likely that many applicants would struggle financially until such time as they either secure employment or are granted a pension.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for those reasons that I moved the amendment that would have the effect of removing that schedule, and there are further amendments relating to another schedule.

         As the member for Melbourne has just outlined, these amendments remove entirely two of the measures in this bill. I will just speak first to the ones that change the assessing qualification for the disability support pension. These amendments from the member for Melbourne would remove entirely the assessment qualification for disability support measure from the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         This legislation, from the government's point of view, is a very important step towards ensuring people with disability get the help that they need to get a job. The disability support pension provides essential income support for people who are unable to support themselves. That is why the government has delivered record increases to the disability support pension and has enabled manifestly disabled applicants for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
          DSP
         </a>
         to get their claims fast-tracked so that they can get their support more quickly. But we can do better than a lifetime spent on welfare for Australians who have some capacity to work. The average length of time people receive the disability support pension is almost 12 years. Currently, many people come onto the disability support pension without testing whether they can be assisted through tailored support such as disability employment services. The new requirements mean that applicants for the disability support pension, other than people with a severe disability, have to show they have tried to get help to find work or to build their capacity before they can be eligible. It could be a different job to the one that they were doing before or some new training or special assistance, but the key for the government is that people get help first.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of us know that a job provides more than a pay packet: it gives dignity and purpose and connects people to their community. The government will make sure that people with disability have every chance to access these opportunities. The changes in the bill make sure that assessments for the disability support pension focus on people's ability, not their disability. They will help people with disability get back to work wherever possible. The government will not be supporting these amendments.

His views on things are not always in accordance with what his own government sometimes seems to be projecting about issues like the carbon tax.

                It does, in a very significant way. I must respond to that interjection from the minister when he says that he did not know that a carbon tax came into matters affecting families. The reality is that if the government is successful in introducing its carbon tax this will be yet another major hit on families in Australia. As I said in my comments in the second reading debate, Australians are already facing a 51 per cent increase in their electricity bills, a 13 per cent increase in their food bills and a 24 per cent increase in their education expenses. The people here in the gallery and those listening to and watching this broadcast are no doubt concerned about the cost of living for ordinary Australian families. That is important in the context of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">
                 Amendment

                because this will hit some 2.1 million Australian families. What we effectively have is a freeze in the indexation of their family tax benefit parts A and B—their supplement to those benefits. A three-year freeze in those benefits means that in real dollar values they are losing money as a consequence of this precise piece of legislation that we are debating at the present time.
               </p>
               <p>
                What the minister raised by way of interjection is pertinent to this legislation. It is pertinent to the matters which are before the House at the present time. One thing that Australian families do not need right now is any further increase in their cost of living. If their cost of living is further adversely impacted as a result of this legislation, that is going to be a further cost on top of the 51 per cent increase in electricity prices we have seen in Australia, a further cost over and above the increase in rents we have seen right across this country and a further cost on top of the increase in education expenses, food expenses and transport expenses. All of these things for ordinary Australian families are going up month by month and we have seen that occur since the government was elected in 2007.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here we have another direct slug on Australian families as a consequence of the freeze in indexation. That means that, because of inflationary pressures, which are already in the economy, the real cost to Australian families is going to be significant. It is significant that they will not get hundreds of dollars because of this freeze which is being imposed by this government in this legislation. So the interjection by the Minister for Resources and Energy, who is at the table, is important.

                  I am speaking to the bill. This is a slug on Australian families, and he probably more than anybody on the other side of this chamber understands that the resource costs are going to be significant in not only what has been occurring over the last few years but also, if we get a carbon tax, the enormous additional cost for Australians. That is why we raised these concerns in the second reading debate. That is why I am raising these concerns again on these matters which are before the House.

                   I note, first of all, that I was the only voice for the ayes in the chamber for that amendment. I move:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   (3) Schedule 2, item 2, page 5 (lines 9 to 15), omit the item.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The effect of this amendment would be to restore the indexation of the family tax benefit. Freezing the indexation of these supplements could create financial hardship for low-income families. It is that concern that ultimately drives us to move this amendment. Although the indexation may in theory only amount to the loss of a few dollars a week, it is a significant amount for low-income and single-parent families.

                   There are over 629,000 recipients of family tax benefit on income support who will be negatively affected by this measure. The supplements were initially designed to deal with family tax benefit debt, but they are now an essential part of budget planning for low-income families. Evidence given by the

                   People whose families are living on, for example, less than $30,000 a year, which includes many families on income support payments, need every dollar they can get. They particularly struggle with bulky expenses such as car registration, fridges breaking down, having to move house, which frequently happens if you rent privately, and finding the bond. These unavoidable expenses often come as lump sums and the feedback we have received from members is that people find those supplements particularly useful to meet those kinds of expenses and also to repay the debts that they have incurred to meet those expenses in the past including, for example, Centrelink debts.

                   , who know a fair bit about the pressures that are faced by low-income families and particularly those on benefits. My electorate of Melbourne has the highest number of public housing dwellings of anywhere in the country, and there are very many people in my electorate of Melbourne on very low incomes who will find it just that much harder to meet the cost of living as a result of the freezing of the indexation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We heard a fair bit a little while ago from the coalition about cost-of-living pressures and forgotten families and so on. This amendment gives them an opportunity to do something about it. They moved a second reading amendment that they knew had no prospect of success. Now they can actually put their money where their mouth is and support the removal of the pausing of indexation of family tax benefit. If they do not, it will be just another in a long line of stunts and ultimately we will find Labor and the coalition agreeing yet again to take money away from those who are doing it the hardest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We accept, as the Greens, that there is an argument for addressing the situation of family tax benefit for those who are not on low incomes, but, until we address the situation of those who are on the lowest of low incomes in this country, this is not a bill that we can support unless the schedule is removed. It is for that reason that I have moved this amendment to remove the schedule. I urge all of those in the chamber, but particularly those who for the last hour have spoken in loud voices about this issue, to support the amendment.

                   <p>
                    This amendment from the member for Melbourne would remove the measure to pause indexation for three years on the end-of-year family tax benefit supplements. The measure delivers savings to the budget of $803.2 million over five years and is part of the government's reforms to make the family payment system sustainable into the future.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As the member for Melbourne has acknowledged, the family tax benefit end-of-year supplements were introduced in 2004 to address overpayments of family payments that arise from parents incorrectly estimating their income for the year. The proportion of families with a family payment overpayment decreased from 32 per cent in 2002-03 to eight per cent in 2007-08. As a result of this change, the forgone increase in 2011-12—this is the change that we are debating—would be, for family tax benefit A, $18 per child for the year, equivalent to 35c a week, and, for family tax benefit B, $11 per family for the year, equivalent to 21c a week.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is very important for everybody to remember that the fortnightly family payments that families rely on week to week will continue to be indexed. The member for Melbourne has raised concerns about very low income families and the impact that this will have on them. I just want to make it very clear to the House what the actual figures will be. The impact on a maximum rate single parent with two young children receiving both family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B will be $47 a year for 2011-12. This represents 0.34 per cent of their total family payments for 2011-12.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is very important to add that these families—who are doing it toughest; it is true—will continue to see their family tax benefit payments rise with normal indexation. For this family that I am talking about, their total family tax benefit, part A and B, will increase by $12.32 a fortnight, or $321.20 a year, from 1 July 2011. This means that this family will still receive at least around $321 more in their family payments next year—and, of course, the actual amounts will vary depending on the ages of their children. If this family has a teenager aged 15 to 19 in school, this government and this parliament have supported—as I am sure the member for Melbourne is aware—a very significant improvement to family payments for teenagers. Those who are eligible may receive up to $4,200 a year in extra family assistance for their 15- to 19-year-olds who are in school. The government very plainly has been a strong supporter of the family payments system. Of course, we have added other measures that have been very important for families, such as the 50 per cent childcare rebate, the new national paid parental leave scheme, the education tax refund and family payments for teenagers, which I have just mentioned. Another issue that the member for Melbourne raises is that faced by families when they have to meet difficult expenditures that require them to find a lump sum of money. To address that the government is improving the advances arrangements in the family payments system. That measure is in the Senate right now and has received the support of the House, which we appreciate. We do understand it is an important measure to help families address what can be lumpy expenditures for them. We also believe in a sustainable and targeted family payments system, so the government will not be supporting this amendment.

                    <p>
                     I indicate to the House, and to the member for Melbourne in particular, that the coalition will not be supporting his amendment. It is not that we do not have sympathy for the sentiment, if I can put it that way, underlying his amendment; hence the second reading amendment which we moved before and the House divided upon. We are obviously concerned for families in the current environment. I will not repeat what I said in my previous contribution to the debate on this bill, but we are very concerned about the rising cost of living for Australian families and the impact that this measure will have on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     However, as the minister indicated in her remarks previously, this amendment comes at a cost of $800 million. It is incumbent upon any party that wants to be taken seriously in the Australian polity to identify where it is going to find $800 million savings. That is the discipline which we in the coalition have taken upon ourselves. We have said that, if we are going to oppose measures which the government puts forward and that opposition will lead to a cost to the budget, we will identify where the savings are going to be made in the budget in order to compensate for that loss to the budget. I say to the honourable member for Melbourne and to the members of his party that, if they wish to be taken seriously in the Australian parliament, they too should exercise that discipline and identify where savings are going to be made for additional expenditure that they outline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If we were not in this situation, where we have seen reckless expenditure from the government over the last four years, this measure would not be necessary. But the reality is that we have to deal with the situation we have at the present time, which is that we have a government which has put the country in hock with a major deficit and a ballooning debt. All of those things have to be taken into account and a response to any individual measure means that there has to be a corresponding indication of where the savings are. As the honourable member for Melbourne has not indicated where that $800 million will be made up then I say that if he wishes to bring forward measures like this it is the responsibility of the Greens to identify where those savings are going to be made. We have not identified where the savings are going to be made. In the future, if we are going to indicate that we disagree with an item which is effectively a saving to the Commonwealth budget and we are therefore going to impose more costs on the budget we will also identify where the savings account are going to be made up. I suspect that I am in furious agreement with the government on this matter as to the way in which the fiscal resources of the Commonwealth should be handled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     For those reasons we oppose this amendment. It is not for any lack of sympathy for the sentiment underlying what the honourable member for Melbourne has put forward by way of amendment and it is certainly not out of any lack of sympathy for the difficult situation that many families find themselves in these days with increasing costs of living, which have been driven up partly by the reckless expenditure of this government. Without rehearsing that argument here at this particular time, those are the reasons—

                       <p>
                        To take up comments made by both of the previous speakers, the Greens approach to this budget has been one of economic responsibility. We have made it absolutely clear, to answer directly the point made by the member for Menzies, that we are not going to propose measures that would have a cost on the public purse without identifying places from which their funding could come from. One of the points that we and others have made is that, increasingly in this budget—this budget which was a missed opportunity to make Australia fairer economically—we and other observers are finding that on questions of economic orthodoxy it is actually the Greens who are most aligned with the recommendations as to what would be a sensible economic framework for Australia.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In particular, we are the only ones in this parliament who are now advocating Treasury's original proposal for a super profits mining tax. Had there not been the cave-in from the government that there was on that tax we would be receiving additional revenue in the order of $10 billion per year. The cave-in, compared with the Treasury proposal, has taken out somewhere in the order of $100 billion over the next decade, which we are now going to have to make up through measures like this. So if the question is where we would find the money from the answer is that we would do what Treasury suggested we should do, and get a fair return to the Australian people from the minerals that Australians own and that we get to dig up and sell only once. If we did that, we would not have to have these debates about how we take money away from families and how we take money away from the poorest of the poor and from those who are doing it the toughest on disability support pensions.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Putting that aside, this budget continues an enormous amount of expenditure on ill-directed subsidies to fossil fuel and mining sectors that are ill deserved. If you want to know where we could get the money for this measure, there is somewhere in the order of $10 billion to $11 billion of subsidies that continue to be paid every year to already wealthy mining corporations, many of whom send their profits overseas. To take one example, somewhere in the order of $2 billion goes to the mining and resources sector simply so that they can buy diesel fuel tax-free. So when the ordinary Australian goes to the bowser they pay 38c a litre on their fuel and, when the very wealthy mining industry goes to buy its diesel fuel, it gets it tax-free—it does not have to pay that 38c because of a subsidy, a subsidy that the Australian taxpayers are giving directly to the very wealthy mining industry. If we get rid of that alone, just for that sector—we can keep it for farmers, for those who deserve it—we will save somewhere in the order of $2 billion. So to answer the question posed by both of the previous speakers: that is where we can find the money. But what that requires is being serious about Australia's future economic prosperity and being serious about fairness—and it is unfortunate that this budget missed the opportunity to do that, and this bill enacts that unfairness.

                          </a>
                          2011 lays the framework for a new, national system of quality assurance and regulation for higher education.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This bill establishes the Tertiary Educ­ation Quality and Standards Agency, or TEQSA, as a single national regulatory agency for higher education.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This legislation was introduced into the Senate by the Hon.
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
                           Chris Evans
                          </a>
                          , Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The establishment of TEQSA is a key part of this government's higher education reforms that were announced in the 2009-10 budget.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These reforms respond to the findings of the Review of Australian Higher Education led by Emeritus Professor Denise Bradley. Professor Bradley's review called for a new approach to higher education resourcing and funding, including the move to a demand driven approach in which funding for undergraduate student places is based on student demand.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In the forthcoming period of rapid growth in higher education, we must be confident that the quality of education that Australian students are receiving can be assured.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The establishment of TEQSA will ensure that the expansion of our higher education system will not come at the expense of quality.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          For the first time in Australia, quality assurance and regulation will be carried out by a single agency.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          By replacing the current state and territory based systems for registration and course accreditation and the quality assurance functions currently carried out by the Australian Universities Quality Assurance Agency, TEQSA will reduce the number of federal, state and territory regulatory and quality assurance bodies from nine to one.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I now turn to the specifics of the bill.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The new agency will be responsible for carrying out regulatory functions including registration and re-registration, accreditation and re-accreditation and conducting comp­liance and quality assessments.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          TEQSA's approach to regulation will be based on proportionality and risk. In carrying out its functions, TEQSA will be required to comply with three basic principles of regulation:
                         </p>
                         <ul>
                         </ul>
                         <ul>
                         </ul>
                         <ul>
                         </ul>
                         <p>
                          This will allow TEQSA to focus its resources on high-risk providers and new entrants to the system, working with providers who are identified as high-risk to address quality issues and improve performance.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          At the same time, the application of these principles will ensure that low-risk providers are not unduly burdened or subject to unnecessary red tape.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          TEQSA will regulate higher education providers using a standards based system.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Higher Education Standards Frame­work will contain a set of national standards that support excellence and diversity in higher education.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Higher Education Standards Frame­work will be developed and maintained by the Higher Education Standards Panel. The panel will be independent from TEQSA and its role will be to provide advice and recommendations to the minister for tertiary education and the minister for research in relation to the framework.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Higher Education Standards Panel will comprise an appropriate balance of professional knowledge and demonstrated expertise in the fields of teaching and learning, research and research training, regulation or standards setting.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          TEQSA will be governed by a chief commissioner, two full-time commissioners and two part-time commissioners.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The states and territories will continue to play an integral role in higher education once TEQSA is established. The government recognises the important role that the states and territories play in the provision of higher education and the bill reflects this.

                          The capacity of states and territories to establish or disestablish universities will remain unchanged by the introduction of TEQSA. New public universities will continue to require legislation in their jurisdiction to be established.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Importantly, TEQSA will be equipped to take real action against providers when serious regulatory breaches occur. The TEQSA bills provide for a broad range of investigative powers and sanctions, similar to those found in other Commonwealth acts such as the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These include administrative sanctions, civil penalties and criminal offences along with appropriate search and seizure powers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The exercise of these powers will be subject to the basic principles of regulation, outlined above.

                          committee's report, which supported the establishment of TEQSA, contained a number of recommendations, each of which were adopted by the government.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Chief among these was amending the bill to explicitly uphold the authority universities already have to self-accredit courses of study. This important amendment recognises that universities are axiomatically self-accrediting and enshrines their academic independence.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The TEQSA bills passed the Senate, as amended, with support from both sides of the chamber.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The establishment of TEQSA goes beyond the strengthening of our higher education system: it will have a far-reaching impact on productivity and participation in the years to come.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It will allow universities to grow and diversify in response to student needs, and in doing so it will open up access to higher education to a whole new generation of Australians.

                          s and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011 gives effect to the government's intention to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, or TEQSA, a new national body responsible for quality assurance and regulation of higher education.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill was introduced into the Senate by the Hon. Chris Evans, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill includes a number of consequential amendments to existing acts which are necessary to ensure that the new regulatory framework for higher education integrates seamlessly with existing regul­atory frameworks and funding programs.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill contains consequential amend­ments to the

                          2003 which recognise that once the TEQSA legislation is enacted, new registration requirements for higher educ­tion providers will apply and TEQSA will be responsible for administering these requirements.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill also contains a number of amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These amendments will allow TEQSA and its staff to undertake the functions relating to provider registration that were previously undertaken by the states and territories and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In addition to these amendments, the bill contains a number of transitional provisions to manage the move to the new regulatory framework, including by outlining the process of registration and re-registration for existing providers of higher education.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill gives TEQSA the power to determine all applications for registration and re-registration that are pending at the time of transition.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          To ensure that regulatory activities are not disrupted during the transition period, the bill also allows for the sharing of information and copies of records from the states and territories to the new authority.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Finally, the bill contains amendments to ensure that the quality assurance activities previously conducted by the Australian Universities Quality Agency continue under TEQSA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I conclude by noting that the government amended the bill in the Senate to implement recommendations made by the Senate

                            2011, the TEQSA Bill. The relevant background to the TEQSA Bill is contained in the Bradley review's report on Australian higher education. This report, handed to government in December 2008, outlined a broad vision for the future of the higher education sector. The key recommendation from this review was an aspirational goal of 40 per cent of Australians between the ages of 25 and 34 holding at least a bachelors degree by 2025.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            As I have previously made mention in this place, including in my comments yesterday in the House with respect to the Higher Education Support

                            (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the coalition have agreed to support this target. There is a key challenge that lies ahead of us, however. Increasing the participation level to 40 per cent will require a considerable increase in the intake of undergraduate students at Australian universities. It is thought to be approximately an additional 220,000 students annually, which means there is great concern in the sector that educational standards may decrease in order to fulfil this goal. There has also been a concern about the quality of some of Australia's non-university higher education providers which has created flow-on reputational effects for the major university providers, especially in relation to international students, who offer a critical revenue stream for universities.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            To counter these concerns, Bradley recommended the creation of one single national standards agency. The standards agency was suggested in order to take on the regulatory functions of the current state based agencies and provide a new national basis for regulation and quality assurance. In May 2009, in response to the Bradley review, the government announced they would accept this recommendation. Shortly thereafter, the then Minister for Education,

                            </a>
                            , announced the intention to introduce legislation to create the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, colloquially known as TEQSA. In response, the coalition gave its in principle support to this recommendation to create a national regulator for the higher education sector. TEQSA will reduce the number of standards agencies from nine, which is currently one for each state, one for the

                            </a>
                            and one which is the federal regulator. They will become just one.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The principle that underpins this bill is that TEQSA is to take a risk based and balanced approach to its regulatory activities. The TEQSA Bill makes amendments to the following existing legislation: the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, to provide TEQSA and its staff with the ability to undertake functions relating to provider registration and monitoring; and the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Support_Act" rel="nofollow">

                            2003, to recognise new registration requirements for higher education providers. The bill also provides for the relevant transition of functions from the current state and territory regulatory authorities to the new agency.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            There has been a lengthy process in drawing up the legislation. During stakeholder consultations in 2010, there was initially widespread concern with parts of the proposed legislation. This resulted in the government delaying introduction of the TEQSA bills, and a draft bill was released for consideration in February 2011.

                            The coalition cautiously welcomed the legislation at first glance, as we support the central idea behind the legislation, which is that our higher education system is simply too small to continue to have a multitude of regulatory authorities. We recognise that robust national standards in Australia are required so that any student undertaking a higher educational qualification can then be assured that they are getting an excellent and valuable education, regardless of which state or territory they choose to study in.

                            But, with this bill, it was critical to have a Senate inquiry and I am pleased that my colleague in the other place Senator Brett Mason insisted on an inquiry. Not only did this bill need the close and thorough scrutiny of the parliament but it was also essential so that the various stakeholders who may be affected by these changes had ample opportunity to make wide-ranging submissions about this process.

                            Regulator work closely with TEQSA, once established, to harmonise and streamline the regulatory approach for multi-sector providers in advance of any future decision to combine TEQSA and the National VET Regulator in a single regulatory agency.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I believe the first recommendation is particularly important to address, with appropriate amendments. As noted in the committee's report:

                            Self-accreditation refers to the ability to enjoy academic autonomy in determining both course and degree content. The notion carries both symbolic and substantive weight, and is a central characteristic of universities as independent institutions of knowledge and learning. As the peak body for Australia's universities,
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                             Universities Australia
                            </a>
                            strongly expressed its concern that "the overall implications of the Bill for university autonomy remain unclear." Universities Australia also pointed out that self accreditation was a first order principle of universities, and as such should be included in the primary, not secondary, TEQSA legislation.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I am particularly pleased to learn that the concerns regarding the provisions in relation to the self-accrediting status of universities have been subsequently fixed. Until the coalition called for a Senate inquiry, some stakeholders were shut out of the government's highly secretive consultative process, but I am pleased to note the committee's work has resulted in a vastly improved bill that we can now support.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I would particularly like to point out that this bill would not be in its current shape without the efforts of my parliamentary colleague Senator Brett Mason, shadow minister for universities and research. Senator Mason put in many hours of consultation on behalf of the coalition in the lead-up to this bill being passed. He has travelled all around Australia, engaging with universities about this issue and many others facing the sector, something that I would suggest his government counterpart Senator Evans failed to do, given the many concerns from stakeholders that were raised with Senator Mason and me over the last year. This is reflected in the comments made yesterday by Professor Denise Bradley

                            , in her capacity as interim chair of TEQSA, when she welcomed its passing in the Senate. I note she was pleased that 'both sides of politics, the educational bureaucracy and sector representatives have been ready to work cooperatively and responsibly'. The provisions in this bill are far reaching. They will affect not only universities but also other higher education providers. The new regulatory agency will have powers that no other regulator has possessed before. Stakeholders, particularly higher education providers, overwhelmingly support the establishment of TEQSA. They support it particularly as it will not only simplify their regulatory arrangements but also help to protect brand Australia in the international education industry, which remains one of our largest non-minerals export industries. Given that education is our fourth largest export industry and a key driver of economic growth and productivity gain, it is important that this reform for our higher education sector was given as much attention as possible by this parliament in order to get it right. I commend the bill to the House.

                             2011. The Gillard government is committed to improving the quality and integrity of our higher education system. In 2008 we initiated a review to examine the ability of our higher education system to meet the needs of the Australian community and economy. The release of the Australian higher education review, known as the Bradley review, was a milestone achievement. The findings of the review and the recommendations made by the expert panel led by Professor Bradley called for a shift in the current funding and resource arrangements for our higher education system to place students at the centre of our system. The Bradley review was the catalyst for a package of reforms announced by this government in 2009-10 to support its productivity and participation agenda, which is something that it has built on again with the release of the recent budget.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The transformation of our higher education system is central to achieving our vision of a stronger and fairer country. Our reforms set new targets for higher education participation and access along with increased resources for teaching, learning and, importantly, research. At the centre of our reforms we are moving to a demand driven approach for funding undergraduate student places. This is something that I certainly welcome as the federal member for Corangamite. Within my electorate I have
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">

                             </a>
                             , and they are certainly expecting a very substantial increase in the number of places that they offer as a consequence of this reform. Deakin University are the largest employer in my electorate and certainly contribute a lot to the life of Geelong. This will free up universities to make the right strategic choices to better deliver on their unique goals and to meet the needs of their student bodies. It will encourage diversity and specialisation, which will allow universities to play to their strengths. It will also help transform the scale, potential and quality of our universities and higher education providers, allowing them to grow in the sector and opening up doors to higher education for a whole new generation of Australians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As we enter a period of rapid growth of enrolments in universities and higher education institutions in Australia, it is important that we as a government and as a nation have confidence in the quality of the education that students are receiving and that there are assurances around this. This bill establishes the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, otherwise known as TEQSA, as a single national regulatory and quality assurance agency for higher education. Using a standards based approach for regulation, TEQSA will require institutions to meet or exceed threshold standards in order to register and deliver higher education in Australia. This will ensure that the expansion of our higher education system will not come at the expense of quality. TEQSA will combine the regulatory activities currently undertaken at this stage by states and territories. This government believes in a single national approach to education reform, and I think this will lead to that happening.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I now turn to the specifics of the functions undertaken by TEQSA. TEQSA will undertake a variety of regulatory functions, including registration and re-registration, accreditation and re-accreditation, and compliance and quality assessments. TEQSA's regulatory approach will be based on proportionality and risk. To support this approach, the government has established a set of basic principles for regulation which TEQSA must adhere to in all of its functions. The principles include the principle of regulatory necessity, which provides that TEQSA should not burden a provider more than is necessary in the functions which it undertakes; the principle of reflecting risk, which provides that TEQSA should have regard to a provider's history, including the history of compliance with state and federal laws relating to higher education; and the principle of proportionate regulation, which provides that TEQSA must exercise its powers in such a way that it is proportionate to a provider's noncompliance. TEQSA will be required to tailor its regulatory actions in order to comply with these principles. Importantly, TEQSA will have the power to undertake enforcement action to address quality issues where necessary. As a statutory agency, TEQSA will be subject to the

                             The Higher Education Standards Framework will incorporate national quality standards and benchmarks. These will be central to ensuring that the bar for entry to the higher education sector is sufficiently high and will provide a solid base of performance from which all providers can build excellence and diversity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As I mentioned earlier, I am very proud to be one of a number of members in this place who have a Deakin University campus in their electorate. Deakin University was of course established in Geelong back in the 1970s and has rapidly grown since then. The university has informed me that it is planning on taking full account of the opportunities to grow its student base over the coming years. I certainly look forward to working closely with it to assist, wherever I can, in enabling it to grow and continue to perform a vital educational set of opportunities for people not only within my electorate of Corangamite but from the seat of Corio and from the federal seat of Wannon, to the west.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Establishing a national framework that deals with quality of our universities makes enormous sense. There is of course some risk that if universities grow too quickly without having some regard for quality those institutions might slip. By putting in place these reforms I think we can grow university student numbers but do it in a way that is sustainable and ensures we have a quality based system. As a consequence I commend these bills to the House and commend the work that has been undertaken by all of our education ministers in making sure that we grow opportunities for all Australians.

                              Australian tertiary education is consistently ranked as amongst the world's best, attracting more international students than does any other country, as a percentage of the population. In fact, education is Australia's third largest export, second only to coal and iron ore. Recently, however, there have been worrying reports of international concern that the standard of Australian universities is not as high as that of our competitors. This concern was discussed as recently as 16 June in the

It aims to ensure the quality of all higher education providers by reducing the number of federal, state and territory regulatory bodies from nine down to just one national agency, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, known as TEQSA. Using a standards based approach to regulation, higher education providers will be required to meet or exceed a threshold standard if they are to be registered in Australia. This issue is of particular importance to me, given that my electorate of Ryan is home to the

                              Quality assurance is hugely important to the sector, particularly in this time of great change. Over the past few years we have experienced a very turbulent time with regard to international students. The negative effects of this government's mismanagement of the international students sector are stark and have been detrimental to the sector as a whole. As reported in the

                              in May last year, the sector saw a 40 per cent decrease in overseas student applications in one month alone. At the time, Stephen Connelly of the International Education Association of Australia cautioned that, should this decline continue, the sector could lose up to 35,000 jobs by the end of 2011. One year on, these statistics have not improved, with the

Student visa applications from outside Australia decreased 32 per cent over the last six months of 2010 compared with 2009, which had already fallen 22 per cent compared to the same period in 2008. Given that it is estimated that international students generate approximately $12.3 billion value added to the economy annually and given declining rates of international student enrolment, it becomes more and more clear that the bill before us today is a positive and necessary step towards quality assurance for the sector. It is also a very timely measure given the changes currently occurring in the system.

                              Earlier this week the House debated a substantial change with the move to a student-demand-driven system for universities. I spoke on the bill at the time, highlighting the importance of tertiary education and supporting the Bradley review recommendation that Australia aspire to having 40 per cent of people aged 20 to 34 holding a bachelor's degree by 2025. This is an ambitious but noble target. Tertiary education enriches lives, enables higher earning potential, increases opportunities, teaches the ability to analyse and encourages and enthuses people about learning. The student-demand-driven system supports this aim and will help to achieve it; however, a target of 40 per cent participation would necessarily mean a huge influx of students into our university campuses. The question must be asked as to how this will be funded and how our universities will be supported to provide the extra infrastructure and resources necessary to cater for this influx of students.

                                  The government's record shows that they think of a grand idea, make a rushed announcement and little further thought is put into the matter. I am concerned that, with the scale of changes taking place in the higher education sector, implementation may yet again prove to be where a good and necessary program fails. I believe these changes are important and will be very disappointed to see that happen.

                                  I hope that today's measure of introducing a single national quality assurance regulatory body will help to ensure implementation failure does not occur. The government has changed its approach to this legislation by actually listening to and extensively consulting with the industry and adopting the changes that were suggested. I pay tribute to the pressure put on by Senator Brett Mason in the other chamber to insist on this wider consultation. This took the original form of this bill from an overprescribed one-size-fits-all regulatory body that was first suggested in relation to TEQSA to a very workable system that has the potential to provide real change to the sector. I am encouraged by this change in the government's attitude and hope that genuine consultation and the process will continue. As we can see from the outcome of this bill, it is certainly a helpful process that delivers a positive change for all Australians.

                                  The quality of our higher education system is of great importance to the sector. Without it, we risk losing the valuable contribution made by international students. We risk our graduates not being regarded with the calibre of their international counterparts and we risk the reputation of our wonderful university system. We should be proud of the success of our universities and graduates and support them through this time of change. TEQSA is a positive initiative in the reform of higher education and I commend this bill to the House.

                                   s and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. The member for Ryan in her speech was critical of the government in relation to the number of people attending universities. The simple fact is that since we were elected in 2007 an extra 80,000 undergraduate students have received the opportunity of a university education. That figure alone indicates our commitment to tertiary education, and the legislation here before the House again builds on that commitment.
                                  </p>

                                   We want a just and productive Australia. We want a prosperous Australia committed to economic development, productivity and the best high-paying and high-skilled jobs that are available. That is why we have focused strongly on higher education, because we believe that higher education transforms the quality of people's lives and enhances their potential. We believe that a university place gives a person the opportunity in life that they could not have if their circumstances were such that their financial capacity could not afford it, their familial history did not support it or their experience did not dictate that university hitherto was an option.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   We strongly believe that the opportunity to attend university really gives a person not just a broadness in their thinking but also a financial security that they would not have otherwise. In a landmark reform, we have committed ourselves to lifting the caps on undergraduate university places. The legislation here demonstrates our comm­itment to the whole system by underpinning a robust quality assurance and regulatory framework which will put a renewed emphasis on student outcomes and the quality of student experiences.

                                   That is why we have committed $70 million over four years to establish this new regulatory framework. We believe this will enhance the quality of education at the tertiary level. The new Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency will, we believe, remove the eccentricities and oddities of Federation with respect to regul­atory systems in the university sector. We believe that in this day and age, in the 21st century, one body and one body alone should govern the regulatory arrangements for universities.

                                   We are pleased that we have got bipartisan support for this and that the sector has played a constructive role in offering suggestions to enhance the capacity of the new body, TEQSA. This will make a big difference, because if every stakeholder has a say and has a vested interest in how this will go then the agency will deliver on the expectation of it and that universities across the country will improve.

                                   Higher education is not just about giving young people opportunity, enhancing the next generation of students and providing the promise of a high-skilled and high-wage job but also about improving the capacity of our economy to withstand things like the global financial crisis. We have made an enormous contribution with close to $4 billion in the budget for this sector. Our higher education sector is crucial to economic prosperity. Ensuring it functions with quality assurance is absolutely essential.

                                   We are following the recommendations of the Bradley review in this regard. Clearly, a national approach is needed, and this was the recommendation. A national approach which underpins domestic and international confi­dence in higher education is crucial because students from overseas play an important role in the sector and engage in high levels of achievement and attainment. You only have to attend a university in any electorate to see that that is the case. I have two universities in my electorate: the University of Queen­sland has an Ipswich campus and the

                                   is at Springfield. I commend the work that they do. I know from speaking to university educators, officials and administrators that they are very much of the view that a national approach to regulation and quality assurance is the right way to go. They are supportive of our demand driven proposals. They are also supportive of the increase in student participation and the consequent numbers we have seen. But they are also supportive of a consistency in national standards and regulation because they believe—and I concur—that this will benefit the higher education sector. This approach means our reputation for higher education and training is assured. If we have consistency in standards and regulations, our international competitiveness is protected and enhanced. If you are a student who has graduated from the University of Southern Queensland in Springfield, for example, and you want to work overseas, recognition of, say, your bachelor's degree in business or your qualification in teaching or in some other area gives you the opportunity to work overseas. This enhances your capacity for gainful employment overseas and it also builds on your reputation locally. Global economies continue to adapt to changing requirements; it is a dynamism which we never thought of in the past. These days you can click a button and transfer money across continents. A student can qualify in teaching or physiotherapy here and work overseas in ways that their grandparents and great-grandparents never thought possible. Overseas travel is so common for university students and our young people today that in some countries it is talked about as being

                                   The legislation will ensure students or prospective students will have access to information relating to higher education in this country so that they can make decisions about the quality of university they attend and the quality of the course they undertake. It can help them make decisions about their academic progress and whether they go to a particular university or do a particular degree. Establishing that kind of confidence in the higher education sector is critical in terms of a competitive academic envir­onment, but it does require thoughtful and careful regulation. TEQSA's approach will be proportionate and risk based. Principles in the legislation are focused on three areas: regulatory necessity, so as not to place unreasonable burden on a particular higher education provider; reflecting risk, in that the agency must consider a range of factors when exercising its power; and exercising proportional regulation.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   In practice these principles mean that this body is not going to be a dictator; it is going to be a regulator, and that is the difference. It is not going to lord it over the sector like the previous government did when it imposed legislation such as
                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

                                   on the sector—something that those opposite always forget. With these principles, we think the legislation will go a long way to enhancing high-quality education. TEQSA will operate as an independent body, at arm's length from the government and the minister. The legislation expressly prohibits the minister from giving a direction to a higher education provider, and that is a good and noble thing as well. Of course, TEQSA will give directions free from political interference. The minister can only give directions to TEQSA where that is deemed necessary to protect the integrity of the higher education sector. The agency, TEQSA, has the capacity to register and reregister higher education providers, to accredit and re-accredit courses of study, to conduct assessments, to monitor, to enforce compliance, to investigate actions, to make recommendations to the minister and to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information—all worthy aspirations, good objectives and good functions in the legislation.

                                   I also commend in the legislation the establishment of the Higher Education Standards Panel. Its members will be responsible for developing standards and advising and making recommendations to the minister and to TEQSA. The panel will be independent of TEQSA's governance and will report directly to the minister. The panel members will have a chair and between four and 10 others will be appointed by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations in consultation with the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.

                                   The smooth transition to TEQSA is a key priority of this government. The bill provides amendments to existing Commonwealth legislation and transitional measures to ensure the smooth transition of functions from the states and territories to TEQSA. The extensive checks and balances in the bill will ensure that TEQSA considers risk in making regulatory decisions. The establish­ment does not affect the states' and territories' ownership of universities or their capacity to establish universities. Disseminating best practice is also a focus of the national system. TEQSA is all about making the sector better and more competitive; it is about making things simpler, clearer, more streamlined and consistent. It will be important for the higher education sector to meet the standards required by home-grown and overseas students. The legislation is warmly welcomed by the university administrators as well as the universities in my electorate and those across the country. I commend the legislation to the House.

                                    s and Transi­tional Provisions) Bill 2011 establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, TEQSA, as a single national regulator and quality assurance agency for Australia's higher education sector. This is a key reform of this government's productivity and participation agenda to transform Australia's higher education system. With a strong focus on higher education participation and attainment, our reforms will bring about significant change to the current landscape of Australian higher education.

                                    TEQSA will play a pivotal role in ensuring the overall quality of our higher education system. It will replace the current state and territory based systems of registration and course accreditation and quality assurance arrangements currently undertaken by the Australian Universities Quality Agency. In doing so, it will reduce the number of federal, state and territory regulatory and quality assurance bodies from nine to one. This will provide for national consistency and efficiency in the registration of all higher education providers. Central to TEQSA are the basic principles of regulation which will ensure it uses a risk based and proportionate approach when undertaking its regulatory activity. These principles provide for TEQSA to take into account the scale, mission and history of each provider when undertaking its regulatory activities. Where poor quality is identified, the action TEQSA will take will depend on the risk of the provider and the seriousness of the contravention.

It will provide the safeguards to ensure that our students are receiving a quality education and assure the reputation of our higher education system both nationally and internationally. It reflects this government's continued commitment to create a quality higher education system that is diverse, innovative and responsive to the needs of its students.

                                      2011 because I believe this is a crucial and important piece of legislation to protect consumers. The introduction of this bill clearly demonstrates the Labor government's ability to deliver on its election commit­ments. More importantly, this legislation represents a crackdown on the unfair treatment of ordinary working Australians who may use a credit card but may not be fully aware of some of the issues surrounding that. This government has listened to the concerns of consumers, and this bill finally recognises that Australians should have more say over how they use their credit cards and that they should also be provided with detailed information clearly explaining exactly what they are signing themselves up for.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      There are approximately 15 million credit card accounts in Australia. The reality is that most Australian families use credit cards as a way to perhaps meet their financial obligations, purchase things they might not be able to afford and do a range of other things. While these credit cards are very important, Australians deserve a system that has their interests in mind, not just the interests of the banks.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Credit card providers currently allow accounts to exceed their credit limits and then charge the account an over-limit fee. This process is a vicious trap that places heavy financial burdens upon Australians using this credit card facility. It is a trap that sees credit card providers gain approximately $225 million per year in over-limit fees. The reforms included in this bill will set the amount by which credit accounts can go over their limits to a maximum of 10 per cent, at the discretion of the lender, and abolish the fee that this usually attracts. This will prevent many Australians from unintentionally slipping into unsustainable levels of debt and often trying to keep up with it—if they have to pay these over-limit fees.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Another unnecessary tactic used by credit card lenders is to allocate initial repayments to the part of the debt that attracts the lowest rate of interest. This makes it extremely difficult for individuals who have exceeded their credit limits to even restore their debt to manageable levels. This bill will simply reverse this order, allowing consumers to pay off their higher interest bearing debt first. This is a much more reasonable approach from credit card lenders and could result in consumers saving a potential $360 per year. This measure is a simple intervention that will assist many Australians with their credit card debts and ensure that others are prevented from spiralling into unnecessary and never-ending debt.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      It is unreasonable for the banks to be capitalising on Australians' use of credit cards by employing financial tactics that are not made clear to consumers. This government recognises that many Australians already struggle with the cost of living. Therefore, this bill seeks to provide a little relief for these Australians by ensuring that they are protected from unfair bank fees and contract fine print.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The bill also includes measures to ban unsolicited credit limit extension offers. Such letters are often sent to consumers to provide them with the option of increasing their credit limit and in many cases result in Australian families taking on unsustainable levels of credit card debt. Consumers are bombarded with these tick-and-flick preapproval offers to increase their credit that do not provide adequate information concerning a consumer's financial health and are therefore very misleading. Unsuspecting consumers simply see an opportunity to increase their credit limit as suggested by their financial institution and approve it without properly considering the implications. I spoke already in this place about unsolicited credit increases in private members' business back in 2008. At that time it was brought to my attention by a number of constituents in my electorate that these unsolicited letters offering credit limit increases seem to be sent only when customers are paying interest on their credit card debt. For example, one constituent indicated to me that they had not had to pay interest for some time. They had regularly paid off their credit card to the full amount each month. It was only when they got caught one month and could not pay the full amount that they attracted interest on their credit card. It was then that the automatic pre-approval was sent, pretty much identifying that when they paid interest and could not pay back the full amount—a change in their trend of normally paying off the full amount—they were automatically encouraged to increase their limit. There was no asking, 'What's happening here? How can you best manage this?' They were automatically told, 'The answer is to increase your credit limit.' This is definitely an issue that I think is very poor, because it does not properly look at an individual credit card user's history. It does not look at what they might be able to afford but instead just directly targets them to encourage them to increase their limit when they have not been able to make their regular repayments. This is a really big problem. It is something that often gets people into difficult situations.

                                     <p>
                                      The objective of this bill is to encourage Australians to use their credit cards in an informed and responsible manner and it seeks to empower consumers to make wise financial decisions. One of the ways it achieves this is by requiring credit card application forms to include a facts sheet to inform consumers. The sheet will provide consumers with a credit card's interest rates on purchases and cash advances, the annual fee and other relevant fees.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The bill before the House today also protects Australians from credit card debt by preventing lenders from charging fees to customers who go over their credit limit. As I have said, this is incredibly important. The bill will also introduce regulations that require lenders to warn consumers about the consequences of making only minimum repayments. This is really important because often people see the minimum repayment and think, '
                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
                                       If I
                                      </a>
                                      keep just paying this it will be okay.' Increased levels of information will greatly assist householders in managing their budgets and in making informed decisions about how much they should pay off to ensure they keep their heads above water.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Many Australians often have the routine of paying back only the minimum amount. This of course leaves interest to accumulate significantly over time and forces many Australians into a lifetime of debt repayment that they will never get ahead of. It is important that consumers are informed about what the consequences are of just making these minimum repayments.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Finally, this bill also introduces a standardised one-page facts sheet that will allow customers to compare home loans. This is really important for many people who perhaps are looking at buying their first home or investing. It is a very big decision and it is very hard to compare these products. Often people feel that they have to go to mortgage brokers to help them compare these home loans. Otherwise they perhaps just go to the institution they know without properly shopping around because it is quite complicated to understand the exit fees, the entry fees, the minimum repayments and whether to take out a variable loan or a fixed loan. All of these are difficult to compare between institutions, so these one-page facts sheets will enable families to directly compare the relative costs of mortgages from different financial institutions so that they can choose a loan that suits their budget and their needs.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      This reform will improve competition in the mortgage market and force banks and other home loan providers to really be clear with Australian families about the products that they are offering. This is an important reform before the House today. This bill places some power back in the hands of consumers, making the information clear and concise, ensuring that people can objectively look at the different products that are available, whether they be credit cards or home loans, and allowing them to have some control and have information about these products. I am really pleased that it is this Labor government that has been committed to creating a fairer, simpler banking system. I believe that these reforms are part of an important step forward.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      I hope that the Senate will also accept our exit fee legislation. I understand that there are some issues and the coalition in the Senate are trying to stop this. It seems a very odd situation when we here on the government side are trying to improve competition within the banking sector and trying to put choice under the control of householders. One of the ways of doing that is by banning unfair exit fees, something that I would expect both sides of the House to agree with, to ensure that there is competition within the banking sector. I hope that the Senate and the coalition members in the Senate see sense and pass that important legislation.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The legislation here before the House is one of the other important steps towards making a fairer, simpler banking system. I hope that this legislation here and the legislation in the Senate get passed because I think that they will make a real difference to local families in managing their credit and finances. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.

                                       </a>
                                       2011 is about protecting Australians from unfair treatment in relation to credit card debt and helping them deal effectively with the banking system. It fulfils an election commitment by the government to assist in empowering consumers. The bill, firstly, seeks to regulate the circumstances in which borrowers go over their credit card limit and to abolish fees when they do so, except where the consumer has provided informed consent to opt in. At the moment, credit card providers usually allow credit card holders to spend over their limit and charge the cardholder an over the limit fee, which currently stands at about $225 per annum. The proposed reforms will allow consumers to go 10 per cent over the limit at the discretion of the lender and abolish the fee when the consumer does so. This discretion is important so that the lender can honour a critical payment, such as for an electricity bill. Consumers will be able to opt out of this default buffer or ask the lender for a larger buffer, depending on their individual circumstances.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Second, the bill seeks to ban unsolicited invitations to extend credit limits on credit cards. Unsolicited credit card limit extension offers can result in consumers ending up with much higher credit limits where they may only be able to repay the credit debt over a long period of time. This legislation will ban unsolicited extension offers from being sent to credit card holders unless they have previously given the organisation permission to send them.

                                      <p>
                                       Third, the bill seeks to require credit card providers to allocate payments to higher interest-bearing debts first. Currently, when consumers make repayments on debt the lenders automatically apply that repayment to the part of the debt on which the lowest rate of interest is charged. This bill reverses that so the repayments are applied to the higher interest-bearing debt first.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Fourth, the bill seeks to ensure that credit card application forms include a clear summary of key account features. This will ensure that consumers have the information about the key features up-front and hopefully these will be easily understood. It is anticipated that the facts sheet will include the interest rate on purchases, cash advances, promotional offers and other relevant fees.

                                       Fifth, the bill seeks to require home loan lenders to give potential home loan borrowers a key facts sheet in order for the borrower to compare various home loans. This measure means that lenders must set out the costs of their standard home loans in a consistent and clear manner on a single page. In consumer testing of this proposal consumers found it extremely helpful and, because it was standardised across lenders, that it provided an easy comparison of home loan products.

                                       on Economics on 11 May this year. The committee recommended that the bill be adopted with one amendment. That amendment relates to the commencement date for clause 2—the key facts sheet for home loans. The committee recommended that the commencement date be amended to 1 January 2012 to allow banks more time to implement the reforms. The original date for implementation was 1 September 2011. This was confirmed by Treasury at the public hearing. The committee report noted, on page 13:

                                       As with many reforms, there may be some teething issues and the committee would like to see some flexibility with enforcement in the early weeks. This would be especially so, given the traditionally high volume of credit transactions at the end of each calendar year.

                                       The most important reform concerns unsolicited credit limit increase offers to individuals. The committee heard consistent evidence during the inquiry that the aggressive marketing by banks of limit increases was a key reason why some consumers have credit problems

And 55 per cent of the events reported by respondents to that survey concerned consumer credit and debt issues.

                                       T anyway, we find about 26 per cent of reported legal events in people's lives relate to consumer and credit debt issues.

                                       In essence, of the participants in the survey referred to, 55 per cent of the events were about credit card debt issues. We are all aware in this House of constituents who come to us for assistance when they are simply overwhelmed by the situation in which they find themselves because of credit card debt. Mr Coorey, a solicitor with National Legal Aid, went on to say that credit card debt is one of the most significant issues facing their more disadvantaged clients. He stated that economically and socially disadvantaged clients are more likely to end up in debt because of unsolicited credit card limit increases.

                                       Later on in the hearing, during an interchange between Mr Brading from Wesley Community Legal Service and the member for Moncrieff—page 28 of the transcript—Mr Ciobo posed the question:
                                      </p>
                                      <p class="italic">
                                       Are you saying that the most profitable group for a lender are those people who cannot afford to pay back the full balance every month? Is that what I am hearing from you?
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Mr Brading replied: 'Correct.'
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       It is those people who are desperate to use their credit card and then find themselves only able to pay back the interest who enter into an almost unwinnable cycle of debt. Many people are in a position to pay off their credit card monthly, so the banks receive no interest from them. As Mr Brading said, it is those in the community who are in the most difficult financial circumstances that the banks benefit from, as they pay interest.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Ms Bond from the Consumer Action Law Centre provided an example—on page 29 of the transcript—of how this would occur. She said:
                                      </p>
                                      <p class="italic">
                                       It is not that people get in trouble and then go out and get a credit card, but they start to get into trouble and perhaps they get a limit increase offer. Their mortgage is overdue and they have the offer, and so sometimes they accept these limit increases when they are in trouble, but it really is a combination of life events and the ease of use of credit and of increases when they are in trouble already.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       The legislation before the House today also delivers on the government's commitment to introducing a compulsory one-page facts sheet for new home loan customers. There is no doubt that a home loan borrower is now faced with a bewildering array of choices when it comes to deciding the most appropriate home loan package. This is hardly made easier by the complexity of the materials provided by home loan lenders. Through the introduction of the facts sheet, the borrower will be in a better position to make an informed decision based on a side-by-side comparison. We know that choosing the best package for a home loan is one of the most important decisions that any of us can make. A mistake of half of one per cent can cost thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands, over the period of the loan. It is crucial that we have the information we need to make an informed decision presented in a format that allows easy comparison.

                                      <p>
                                       The explanatory memorandum provides some detail of what this facts sheet will provide, in part 3-2A. The terms of a home loan and types of contracts are usually regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The proposed key facts sheet for standard home loans will contain information and will comply with the regulations under the act. It is proposed that the key facts sheet will be prescribed by the regulations.

                                      <p>
                                       Chapter 2, item 2.11 of the explanatory memorandum outlines the summary of information to be provided by the facts sheet: the interest rate; the all-in rate—that is, the total cost including interest plus fees; the total cost of the home loan; particular product features; fees; and an explanation of how monthly payments will be affected if interest rates increase. With this simple facts sheet, home loan borrowers will be able to make a simple, straightforward comparison of the various options available to them.

                                        2011 will amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to give effect to the government's Fairer, Simpler Banking policy and introduce a requirement for lenders to give borrowers a simple one-page key facts sheet for home loans to help them shop around for a better deal.

                                        The bill delivers on the government's election commitment to crack down on what people generally believe to be unfair treatment of Australians with credit cards and to help them get a better deal in the banking system. It is intended to give a better deal to the consumer, who I would have thought was the most important person in the banking system. The bill will give consumers more say over how they use their credit cards and help them better understand what they are signing up to. This is an important reform for the many households and businesses that use credit cards, whether sporadically or every day. Credit cards are here to stay, so we want a fairer system surrounding credit cards.

                                        The measures in this bill build on the government's new national responsible lending reforms by giving credit card holders more control over the amount of money they borrow and ensuring that they are not charged excessive fees. This is about credit limits and the fees that go with such borrowing. It is all about sticking up for consumers against the big banks, stopping price gouging and reducing credit traps for the unwary. The main measures in this bill are in the areas of over-limit fees, the allocation of debt payments and credit extensions.

                                        What do we mean by over-limit fees? Consumers want and need a credit card market that is transparent, that competes hard for customers and has built-in protections to help stop them falling into credit card debt traps that they may not be able to get out of. As the former speaker, the member for Banks, quite rightly pointed out, those people that can least afford it are those that are trapped in credit debt. Of course, a lot of us could not survive without our credit cards, especially in terms of convenience, but a large proportion of credit card revenue in fact comes from penalty fees, which include fees for exceeding the card limit. Credit card providers currently charge approximately $225 million a year in over-limit fees. Credit card providers generally allow accounts to go over their credit limits, with the credit provider then charging the borrower what we call an over-limit fee.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        The reforms will ban over-limit fees unless a consumer has specifically asked for the ability to go over their limit and has indicated that they are prepared to pay a fee for this service. Without this agreement, lenders will be able to provide credit over a consumer's limit provided no fees are charged. It is important to allow lenders this discretion. For example, it is in the interests of a borrower for their lender to honour a payment of an electricity bill so their power is not shut off. Consumers can opt out of this default buffer if that is best for them. Indeed, they may consider it would help them to manage their finances better. They will also be able to ask their lender, if they so choose, for a larger buffer if they decide they are prepared to pay a fee for this service. It is about clear, transparent communications in what is, after all, one of the major relationships that takes place in our community.

                                        What do we mean by the allocation of repayments? The measures we are putting in place in this legislation will force credit card lenders to allocate repayments to higher interest debts first rather than last, as it currently stands. Most credit card providers charge more interest for things like cash advances, as is their right. This bill will mean that credit card users who find that they need a cash advance for an unexpected bill, for example, will not have to wait to pay off all other credit card debt before the higher interest rate debt is reduced. The bill will reverse this order so that the consumers can pay off their higher-interest-bearing debts first, resulting in reduced interest charges. This is a very simple matter, and it is a welcome change. It is estimated that a credit card user could save $360 a year or more depending on their spending habits and credit limit. This approach has already been adopted in the

                                        has already introduced this change—all part of its marketing strategy now that it is a different bank—and that has benefits for consumers, particularly in terms of competition.

                                        What do we mean by unsolicited credit limit extension offers? Sometimes consum­ers are offered credit limit extensions that require only a click of the mouse, an answer of 'yes' on the phone or a tick on a reply paid form. Only that! This can result in consumers extending their credit limits without due consideration of the implic­ations, which may include more debt and reduced lending capacity for home loans, personal loans and so on. Some consumers think: 'The bank is offering me this limit; I must be able to afford it. Surely the bank wouldn't offer me something if they didn't responsibly think I could afford it.' Forget it.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        Relatively high limits might mean a debt can only be repaid over many years, incurring considerable costs in interest and potentially causing financial difficulty, if not ruination. The legislation will ban unsolicited credit limit extension offers from being sent to credit card holders unless they have specifically given previous permission to receive them. It is better to have that box ticked 'yes' than to give a willy-nilly blank-cheque credit extension. This will make sure that lenders give consumers more say over nominating their own credit limit. The government will introduce amendments to the bill to clarify that consents obtained before commencement will be valid for the purposes of sending unsolicited credit limit increase offers.

                                        Other reforms announced as part of the Fairer, Simpler Banking policy are intended to be introduced through regulations to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which I mentioned earlier. These include another important measure, to ensure that lenders tell consumers the implications of making only minimum repayments, such as repayment time frames et cetera. This is a very important one. It will help consumers avoid long-term credit card debt put on the never-never, resulting in higher debts and interest payments. The calculation of interest will also be standardised within these regulations to enhance comparability between credit cards. Lenders will also be required to ask consumers to nominate a credit limit when they apply for a credit card.

                                        What about the application forms? The bill will require application forms for credit to include a key facts sheet for potential credit card users. This will give consumers upfront information in plain English about the key features of the credit card for which they are about to apply. Such information will include the interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers, the annual fee and other relevant fees.

                                        The greater credit package also delivers on our commitment last year to introduce a compulsory, one-page key facts sheet for new home loan customers. This will allow consumers to easily compare loans they are offered by a big bank side-by-side with what will often be a better deal from their local credit union or building society, so people can clearly make the comparison in a table. We want consumers informed through better information so that they can compare deals, which will encourage banks and non-bank lenders to put forward better deals. Reform of the regulation of credit cards is part of phase 2 of the national credit reforms. These reforms are part of

                                        The key facts sheet for home loans measure was part of the government's banking package, announced in December 2010. Lenders must set out on key facts sheets the costs of their standard home loans in a consistent and clear single-page format. It will allow consumers to easily compare home loans, particularly in relation to costs. Consumer testing in January 2011 showed that consumers found the information to be very helpful and that the standardised nature of the document permitted easy comparison between home loan products. Consumers who already had home loans stated a wish that the key facts sheet had been available when they were shopping for a home loan.

                                        The prohibition on unsolicited credit limit extension offers and the election commit­ment to include advice about minimum repayments on statements, which is to be implemented in the regulations, will apply to both new and existing credit card contracts. That is a very important point to make. It will also involve and apply to existing credit card contracts. The government has strong legal advice from the

Reforms since then have been designed to drive greater competition in the banking industry through providing customers with more information and more power to exercise their rights as consumers. Ultimately we want these reforms to reduce people's debt and save them money.

                                         The bill amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. That was landmark legislation which for the first time established a national consumer credit regime. Among other things that act provides for responsible lending conduct requirements on financial institutions. That means banks and other lenders are not allowed to provide credit products and services that are unsuitable for the consumer's needs and that the consumer does not have the capacity to repay. It also includes enhanced enforcement powers for ASIC and expanded consumer protection.

                                         We always recognised that there would be more work needed to help consumers better manage their financial arrangements and to protect them from banking industry practices that relied on a lack of transparency and that risked creating debt traps for consumers. During the last election we announced our Fairer, Simpler Banking policy which takes our banking and consumer reforms further and particularly focuses on giving people a better deal on their credit cards. Credit cards have become a fact of life for most Australians. There are around 15 million credit card accounts in Australia today and many individuals and families have more than one card. Credit cards can be a convenient way for people to shop and are indispensable for many transactions, especially those carried out over the internet. They are also a source of enormous revenue for banks in both interest charges and fees. Both of these points are good reasons for the government to give special attention to credit cards and give consideration to appropriate regulation for that part of the lending sector.

                                         There is also growing evidence that credit cards warrant such regulation going beyond the responsible lending obligations already in place. Credit cards have a number of unique features that can lead to problems for bank customers. They have high interest rates and holders are only required to repay a relatively small amount each month. Many customers can make that arrangement work for them but it can also mean that credit card debts can mount up very quickly and result in people paying interest month after month with little capacity to repay the principal. Credit cards are also the subject of particularly aggressive marketing by lenders, which often obscures the full financial implications of what is being offered to people. Given all of that, it is not surprising that financial counsellors and those working with struggling families—organisations like

                                         This government wants to make sure that Australian credit card holders can get the benefits of having a credit card without leaving themselves open to excessive fees and interest charges. That requires consumers to be fully informed about how their credit card operates and it requires lenders to provide information that can be easily understood and compared to other products in the market. The additional requirements on financial institutions contained in this bill were made plain during the election and since then there has been extensive consultation by Treasury with the banking sector and consumer representatives. There has also been an inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives Standing

                                         During the course of the consultations, and in submissions put to the inquiry, there was a lot of resistance to the bill coming from banks and other lenders. It is easy to see why, when the

                                         in its June quarter 2010 bulletin reported that fees charged to customers for exceeding credit card limits including late payments totalled $470 million for the year to 30 June 2009. That is just one example, but it gives the game away as far as the banking industry is concerned. They have a lot riding on this. They have a lot riding on the particular nature of credit card contracts and the business model built on that. But if the banks have a lot riding on this reform then it stands to reason that so have consumers: if banks are making a lot of money out of credit cards then consumers are losing a lot of money. That is why the government is determined to go ahead with this bill and the protections it will introduce.

                                         In his second reading speech the Treasurer gave a number of examples of how credit card holders could save surprisingly large amounts of money by making small changes to the way they manage their credit cards based on the information that will be provided to them and the restrictions placed on lenders as a result of this bill. That might be increasing the amount they repay each month over and above the minimum monthly repayment. It might be by avoiding penalties for exceeding their credit limit by a small amount. Or it might be by putting card holders more firmly in control of how and when they increase their credit limit. We want to empower Australian consumers to better manage their credit card debts and avoid debt traps that are far too easy to fall into today. We also want banks and other lenders to embrace the opportunities that increased competition in the sector can bring.

                                         —was offering some of the same measures to its customers and selling them as a feature of its credit card products. For some time now the National Australia Bank has been aggressively marketing its cuts to fees and charges, two of which will come into effect across the industry under this bill. From January this year the

                                         started applying repayments to the component of a cardholder's debt with the highest interest rate. This is in addition to an earlier decision by the NAB to abolish over-the-limit fees on all credit cards. I have seen reports where the National Australia Bank estimates these measures to save customers $170 a year. That is $170 of hard-earned money that previously customers were paying for no benefit to themselves and purely into the bottom line of the National Australia Bank. For its part the bank estimates that just the change to the debt repayment hierarchy will cost it $4 million. That just goes to show that what we are talking about in this bill is not some hypothetical wishful thinking. That is $4 million that will not come out of customers' pockets. These reforms will change the balance between banks and their customers—change it in the customers' favour and in ways that they will be able to measure in real dollars and cents.

                                         I will turn now to the specific measures in the bill. They are all important changes but, according to the evidence before the parliamentary inquiry, the most significant one is the ban on unsolicited offers to borrowers to increase their credit limit. It has become common practice for lenders to send out material to their customers offering increases in their credit limit using words like 'preapproved' and making it as simple as signing a 'tick and flick' form. The submission to the House of Representatives
                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">

                                         on Economics from the Consumer Action Law Centre referred to a 2009 study in Victoria which showed that 84 per cent of credit card holders in that state had received an unsolicited credit card limit offer increase. That rate was consistent across demographic groups, including people who were unemployed or healthcare card holders.

                                        <p>
                                         In evidence before the committee the coordinator of the Consumer Credit Legal Centre talked of 'countless examples over the years of people on very low incomes who have accepted a series of credit limit increases'. The higher the credit limit the less likely it is that the full balance will be paid off each month. People end up on a debt treadmill, paying off a little each month while the interest on the outstanding amount grows to unmanageable and very stressful levels. They are not defaulting entirely, so the banks are happy, but these are the people who are finding themselves in a position where they can never get ahead either. We do not think that is fair and it should not continue. Under these changes people will be able to make considered decisions about whether it is necessary for them to increase their limit but they will not be bombarded with offers enticing them down a path that could result in higher levels of debt than they need or than they can manage to repay.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         This bill will also require lenders to include on the monthly statements they send out to customers a clear warning about the consequences of making only minimum repayments. This will stop customers falling into the trap of paying the minimum repayment while the total continues to incur high rates of interest. The difference of paying even a slightly higher amount off the outstanding debt can add up to significant savings over time, and it is certainly better than giving that money to the bank as interest that could have been avoided. We want people to have the knowledge they need to make their money work as hard as it can for them, not the banks' shareholders.

                                        <p>
                                         For similar reasons the bill forces lenders to allocate the payments made by customers to higher interest debts first. The most obvious example is where a customer's bill includes an amount for cash advances and an amount for regular purchases. Previously the bank would credit the payment received against the regular transactions, which attract a lower interest rate, while the full amount of the cash advances would continue to accrue the higher rate of interest that applies to those transactions. This is the change the National Australia Bank estimates could save card holders $170 a year. Treasury puts the figure even higher. Whatever the amount is, it is better off in the pocket of the family who earned it than inflating the bank's profit result.

                                        <p>
                                         One of the largest sources of fees going to banks from credit cards comes from transactions that take customers over their card's debt limit. Currently lenders allow customers to exceed their limit, but the customer is then liable for an over-limit fee, usually around $20 to $25. This bank revenue is reported by the Reserve Bank as running into hundreds of millions of dollars annually. From now on lenders will be prevented from charging fees to customers who go over their credit limit unless they have expressly asked for this service. Lenders will have the discretion to allow transactions over the credit limit up to a default buffer of 10 per cent of the card's limit, but if they allow that to happen it cannot incur a fee back to the customer.

                                        <p>
                                         Finally, the bill seeks to provide customers with easy-to-use information about credit products like home loans and credit cards. Lenders will be required to produce a key facts sheet for standard home loans, setting out in a standardised format pricing and other information, allowing consumers to readily compare different home loans. A similar requirement will apply to credit cards so that credit card applications will include key information about the annual percentage rate and other contract terms. People will be able to compare the offerings of different institutions and work out what will cost them the least and what will work for them. That is exactly what we are trying to achieve in this bill. This bill is another way the government is helping Australians to get the most out of their hard-earned money. We want bank customers to have the knowledge and capacity to make sound financial decisions and informed choices so that they can access the financial products that they need. Above all, we want to make sure that people's hard-earned money can work for them.

The purpose of the bill is to amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which includes the National Credit Code, and it continues this government's commitment to effective credit reform— in particular, our Fairer, Simpler Banking policy. The bill delivers on the government's election commitment to take actions to provide greater protections for Australians in their use of credit cards and most importantly to ensure they are not being charged excessive fees for this usage. I seek to speak in this debate because I am acutely conscious of the increasing role of credit in modern life. When I was in my young married days we had a home loan and store cards, and it was not long before credit cards were added to that. Now, many people also have credit on things like mobile phones, and the extension of credit throughout their lives has continued. On top of that, there is far more comprehensive calculation of and shared information about people's credit histories, so it has an even more far-reaching impact on their lives. It is critically important that as a national government we are actively engaged in this area.

Then I will outline the specific details of the bill and, finally, I will address some of the important local implications of the bill for my own constituents. I turn first to the broader context. The government has been committed to building national responsible lending reforms, and we have been progressing this important agenda as part of

                                          's national credit reform agenda. The Fairer, Simpler Banking reforms were announced during the 2010 election campaign, with the reforms to be implemented by mid-2012. Consequently, legislation was introduced in the first sitting of parliament this year which requires lenders to meet the new obligations from 1 July 2012. This particular bill will give consumers greater control over how they use their credit cards and will help them to be better informed about the credit agreement that they are undertaking.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          To achieve this the bill covers five specific areas of reform. First, it regulates overlimit fees. A problem arises because credit card providers generally allow accounts to go over their specified credit limit, but the customer is then charged a higher overlimit borrowing fee for that activity. It is reported that credit card providers currently charge approximately $225 million per year in such fees. The reforms in this bill will ban overlimit fees unless the customer has asked for the facility—that is, they want the ability to go over their limit and they indicate that they are aware of and are willing to pay an additional charge for the facility. More generally, lenders will be allowed to provide credit in excess of the customer's agreed limit providing they do not charge a fee for their decision to allow the customer to overdraw on their credit. It is important to allow lenders this discretion, as in a range of circumstances they would allow an overdraw, but that should not draw an additional charge unless such an arrangement is explicitly previously agreed to by the customer. On the other hand, customers will also have the power to opt out of this default buffer if they feel that is a good option for them. Consumers will also be able to ask their credit provider, if they so choose, for a larger buffer for which they are prepared to pay an access fee.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          The second area of reform in this bill is the allocation of repayments. It is currently the case, and my colleague the member for Capricornia outlined this very effectively, that the vast majority of credit card lenders allocate repayments firstly towards that part of the debt which is attracting the lowest interest rate. The example the member for Capricornia gave was that cash advances attract a higher rate than standard purchases, and so the lenders' policy is clearly detrimental to the borrower as the effect of the repayment is not maximised. This bill will reverse the order so that consumers can pay off their higher interest-bearing debts first. This will enable a credit card user to save an estimated $360 per year or more, depending on their spending habits and their credit limit. This approach has already been adopted in the United Kingdom and United States jurisdictions. I would also point out, as other speakers have, that since the announcement was made in the 2010 campaign the

                                          The third area of reform in the bill goes to the practice of unsolicited credit limit extension offers, which have also been discussed by some of my colleagues. This is where unsolicited approaches are made, often by letter or, today, even by email or contact on the web when banking services are accessed. They offer preapproved, ready to go, immediate access to a higher limit, requiring very little engagement with the customer other than a yes or the tick of a box to up their limit. The problem is that consecutive decisions can very quickly end up with people having relatively high limits which are often beyond their capacity to manage. This increases the likelihood of repayment defaults and credit users falling into arrears, and it compounds the effect of the financial difficulties people find themselves in. This legislation will ban unsolicited credit limit extension offers being sent to credit card holders unless they have, again, previously given permission for such invitations to be sent to them. The original bill has been amended to clarify that consents obtained before the commencement will be valid for the purposes of this bill.

                                          Many of the most important features of credit card services are encompassed in the application forms that are originally completed by the customer. This bill will require application forms to include a key facts sheet for potential credit card borrowers. This is intended to give customers upfront information about the key features of the particular credit card for which they are about to apply and can include information such as interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers, and the annual fee and other relevant fees. It should also be noted that further reforms that were part of the Fairer, Simpler Banking policy are intended to be introduced through regulations to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. These will include the requirement that lenders inform customers about the implications of paying only minimum repayments on their statements—a situation that often ends up in higher debt and higher interest payments and the feeling of being on the treadmill of never getting on top of your debt. They will also include standardisation in the calculation of interest to enhance comparability between credit cards and the requirement on lenders to ask customers to nominate a credit limit when they apply for a credit card.

                                          This bill will also fulfil the commitment of the government to provide a key facts sheet for home loans. This was part of the government's banking package announced in December 2010. It will provide information on standard home loans in a consistent—

In the final part of my contribution I would like to speak about an aspect of credit that is important, which I raised at the beginning of my contribution, around people managing their credit responsibilities and the implications that occur for them when they have difficulties with that.

                                          There was an important pilot project on credit that I was able to launch in my local area in May. Many of us would be well aware of the ease with which people, particularly when they are vulnerable or in difficult circumstances, can fall into poor credit practices and end up in difficult financial circumstances, which leads to negative credit ratings. The implications of this poor rating on their ability to access credit, to get a rental property, to purchase telephone services and on many other aspects of normal daily life are profound. The repercussions drive them even further into financial difficulties and, all too often, into the grasp of aggressive and unscrupulous lenders in the general market place.

                                          The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs announced on 17 February this year that the federal government would provide $6.27 million for a pilot to be run by five community development finance institutions across Australia to provide individuals and organisations with appropriate financial product loans that they would otherwise be excluded from accessing. This measure recognises that Australia has a well-established banking industry but that there are individuals who suffer financial exclusion, maybe from low levels of financial literacy or poor knowledge of financial products and services. For these people the standard services may be denied because of previous poor records or they may exclude themselves because of their lack of trust or knowledge of those services. Sadly, all too often, these people can also fall prey to people like day lenders and so forth, who charge extremely high rates of interest. This often leads them into real financial distress. It is clear from many studies that this sort of pressure is devastating on families and can contribute to problems such as conflict and family breakdown.

                                          pilot seeks to build the capacity and resilience of disadvantaged and financially excluded individuals by attracting investment and injecting funds into community finance organisations which will offer them appropriate products supported by education and services to manage the repayment of these loans. They will provide financial literacy skills and, importantly, improve the saving and loan repayment record of the individual. This is an important program and in the Illawarra the two local partners have been funded with $2.3 million to deliver the pilot. The launch was organised by Mr Peter Quarmby, who is the executive director of strategic development at Community Sector Banking, which is headquartered and was established in Corrimal in my electorate.

                                           Between 1996 and 2007, credit card debt in Australia rose from $6.6 billion to $42 billion. Currently it sits at around $49 billion. Monthly figures for total credit card transactions—that is, cash advances and purchases—went from $2.1 billion in March 1996 to $18.3 billion in November 2007. For March this year, the figure was around $21.6 billion. In the last decade the collective profits of the four major banks rose from around $8 billion in 2001 to nearly $21 billion in 2010.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           I make two observations from those statistics. Firstly, credit card debt blew out under the previous coalition government. Secondly, bank profits have risen as credit card use and credit card debt have increased. The obvious link between credit card debt and bank profits is simple, and other speakers on this bill have made reference to it. Firstly, there are more fees and charges—in particular, overlimit fees, which both the member for Cunningham and the member for Capricornia alluded to in their remarks on this bill. Secondly, the interest rate charged for credit card debt is generally much higher than for normal mortgage loan or overdraft debts.

                                          <p>
                                           In years gone by, the four credit cards were not used as prevalently as they are today. Bank customers might have sought a temporary overdraft or a personal loan, and a temporary overdraft or a personal loan would have generally attracted an interest of two or three per cent above mortgage loan rates. Credit card loans, which is effectively what they are when people use the credit facilities allowed to them under their credit card, are more in the vicinity of 18 to 20 per cent—that is, two to 2½ times higher than getting those same credit advances in years gone by.

                                           There is no question that, in recent decades, Australians have changed the way in which credit is used. Since the introduction of Bankcard in 1974, our credit card culture has become entrenched. It has been largely driven by a push from the banking sector to encourage the use of credit cards as we head more and more towards a cashless society. A survey undertaken by the

                                           last year confirmed what anyone can see merely by opening their mail or taking notice of advertising—that is, banks are actively encouraging their customers to use credit.

                                           The survey results, which were published in'Money and Power: the case for better regulation in banking', show the extent to which unsolicited offers were made for new credit cards, personal loans or increased credit card limits. Over a 12-month period, from mid-2009 to mid-2010, two out of three respondents had received an unsolicited offer for a new credit card, one in two had received an unsolicited offer to increase their credit card limit, one in three had received an offer for a personal loan and one in five had received an offer to increase the available credit on their home loan.

                                          <p>
                                           The banks will say that these offers were made by banks to existing customers who had demonstrated over an extended period of time a capacity to determine whether a higher credit card limit would be of service to them. The response that banks made offers to extend credit limits only to persons capable of making an informed decision, based on their capacity to repay the loan, may seem reasonable. However, in the context of a society driven by consumption, this situation warrants closer scrutiny.

                                           As a society we are dedicating a lot of energy to addressing problems such as anxiety and depression. Financial hardship and insurmountable debt are often causes of anxiety and depression. Over the last decade, credit card debt rose from $16 billion in $2001 to $49 billion in April 2011. This represents an increase of over 300 per cent in the level of credit card debt Australians have incurred over the last decade. Using credit may not be anything new, but the level of debt being incurred is of concern. The measures in this legislation will assist individuals and families to manage their finances.

                                           2011 gives effect to the government's Fairer, Simpler Banking policy. These reforms will regulate the circumstances in which borrowers can go over their credit limits and will abolish fees when they do so, except in situations where the consumer has provided informed consent to opt in. They will require credit card payments be allocated to repayments of higher interest bearing debts first, and other speakers have referred to the importance of that matter. The reforms will ban unsolicited credit limit extension invitations that encourage borrowers to increase their credit limit, except where the consumer has provided consent to opt in. The reforms will make it mandatory for credit card application forms to include a clear summary of key account features and, finally, the reforms will introduce a requirement for home loan lenders to give potential borrowers a key facts sheet so that they can compare home loans.

                                           Other aspects of the Fairer, Simpler Banking policy will be introduced through regulations to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. Regulating the circumstances in which borrowers can go over their credit limits is an appropriate measure to ensure that individuals do not find themselves in debt that they are unable to overcome. Indeed, I have to ask why such features are possible to begin with. The requirement that credit card payments are first made to higher interest bearing debts is logical and takes some pressure off individuals navigating their way out of debt. Banning unsolicited credit limit extension invitations that encourage borrowers to increase their credit limit, except for where the consumer has provided consent to opt in, may help banks to once again balance their role to one that is between a business seeking to maximise profits and a service provider to the community.

                                           Bank workers in Australia are often paid a commission or have targets imposed on them to sell their bank's products, and encouraging customers to take on a heavier credit burden can be part of their employment demands. Less scrutiny is also being applied to providing consumers with additional credit. I recall listening some 12 months ago to a radio interview with a person who had got into enormous financial difficulty through credit granted to them by their bank. Ultimately, the person was taking a new credit card, with the credit that went with it, in order to pay off the previous one. This became a chain reaction, with one credit card after another being taken out by the consumer in order to secure credit to make the minimum payments on the previous credit card debt that the person had incurred. In the end, the person was simply unable to cope with the financial demands on them and I understand that the bank had to write off the debts. The problem with writing off the debts is that it does not really help the consumer at all—that consumer finds that they are now a credit risk and unable to secure credit in the future. Just as importantly, banks' bad debts are inevitably costed into their operations, which effectively means that every customer shares, in a sense, the cost to the bank of the bad debts incurred.

                                           Historically, bankers have asked two questions when approving credit. Firstly, they asked about the availability of collateral. Secondly, they asked whether the client could demonstrate a capacity to make full repayment, including the interest that would be accrued. That no longer appears to be the case. I believe that regulation is critical to ensuring that the banks understand that their role goes beyond a narrow pursuit of profit but indeed plays a critical role in the lives of Australians and in the workings of the national economy.

                                           These reforms also seek to ensure that potential customers have access to valuable information which they can use to make an informed decision about whether a particular account is the best option available to them. Providing a clear summary of key account features will do that. Similarly, a requirement that home loan lenders provide a key facts sheet so that potential borrowers can compare home loans is a simple reform which gives Australians the best chance of selecting a home loan that best suits their circumstances. It is not always easy for someone purchasing their first home to compare loans and understand the full implications of the undertakings they are about to embark on. Finally, I note that this legislation was referred to the House of Representatives Standing

                                            2011 delivers on the government's election commitment to crack down on unfair treatment of Australians with credit cards and to help them get a better deal with their credit cards and home loans. The measures in this bill build on the government's first phase of consumer credit reforms and reflect the government's ongoing commitment to empowering consumers. I am indebted to the contributions of the many members of parliament, from all sides, who have spoken in this debate, in particular the most recent address by the member for Makin. As he highlighted, these reforms address the two most common credit products in Australia—credit cards and home loans. In relation to credit cards, the bill delivers on the government's election commitment and implements the most significant reforms in this area in 15 years. It will build on our new national responsible lending credit reforms by giving credit card holders more control over the amount they borrow.

                                            Contrary to the claims of some in the House, these reforms did not appear mysteriously out of nowhere. We have had an extensive consultation process. My predecessor launched the green paper on 7 July 2010. Then we announced, during the 2010 election campaign, that we would implement these very reforms. Since that time, we have worked hard to consult with the banking industry to ensure these reforms were commercially workable while minimising implementation costs for industry. For example, in the lead-up to the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement of the Gillard government's comprehensive banking reform package—in the period prior, from July to December 2010—the
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Treasury" rel="nofollow">

                                            met with the Australian Bankers' Association in no less than nine highly productive, face-to-face meetings. The government has continued to work closely with industry on implem­entation. The result is a bill that minimises the implementation costs for industry while also meeting our objective to get Australian families a better deal on credit cards.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            This bill will give consumers more say over how they use their credit cards and will ensure that they are fully informed about what they are signing up to. The bill prohibits lenders from sending unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase their credit limit. Currently, consumers who receive tick-a-box offers can end up overindebted; they can end up with credit limits for amounts they cannot easily repay and with arrangements which cost them more over the long term. Consumers will of course still have the opportunity to increase their credit limit if they decide that is what they want, but this bill will put a stop to consumers being bombarded, every time they open the mail, with preapproved tick-and-flick offers to increase their credit limit. The bill prevents lenders charging exorbitant fees to customers who go over their credit limit, unless those customers have expressly asked for this service. This important reform will mean an end to most credit limit overdraw fees and will mean significant savings for Australian families and all consumers. The bill requires lenders to allocate repayments to higher interest debts first so that families do not pay more interest than they should. A cash advance will be paid off before an interest-free purchase, saving consumers money.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            In addition, we will also make regulations requiring all lenders to include clear infor­mation on monthly credit card statements warning consumers of the consequences of only making minimum repayments. Consumers will be encouraged to make higher payments rather than carrying debt at credit card interest rates. The bill also delivers on our commitment last year to introduce a compulsory key facts sheet for home loan customers. The Deputy Prime Minister announced in December that the Gillard government would take further action in three broad streams of reform—to empower consumers to get a better deal in the banking system, to support our smaller lenders so they can put more competitive pressure on the big banks and to secure the long-term safety and sustainability of the financial system so it can continue to provide reasonably priced credit to Australian households and small business.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            To have a competitive banking system, consumers have to be able to walk down the street and get a better deal for the family. To do that, consumers need two things: firstly, to be rid of unfair exit fees and, secondly, to have the tools and the information to be able to compare the offerings of different lenders. That is why the introduction of the key facts sheet is so important. Families will be able to compare the cost of different home loans by putting facts sheets from different lenders side by side. They will be able to tell at a single glance the savings they could make between different home loans every year and over the life of the loan. This reform is all about forcing banks and other home loan providers to be transparent and honest with Australian families and promoting compet­ition in our banking system. Choosing the wrong loan can be expensive. Half a per cent more interest on a $250,000 loan can cost a borrower $30,000 more over 30 years. It is a very important step in empowering Australians to be able to make the best financial decisions for themselves.

                                            I will shortly introduce some minor amendments to this bill which are the result of feedback from stakeholders. These amendments will make it easier for lenders to comply but do not in any way reduce the effectiveness of the measures we are introd­ucing. The Gillard government is changing the way banks do business and putting power back into the hands of the consumers. These reforms will help Australians with credit cards and home loans manage their debt so that every dollar of a borrower's hard-earned repayments works harder for them.

                                             On behalf of the government, I move a number of minor but nonetheless important parliamentary amendments to the bill. These amendments will help minimise the cost of implementation for industry and will make things simpler for consumers while ensuring strong protections for families. Firstly, we have listened to the stakeholders and agreed with the House of Representatives Standing
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
                                              Committee
                                             </a>
                                             on Economics recommendation that the commencement date for the obligation to provide a home loan key facts sheet be moved to 1 January next year. This will give lenders almost a full year and a half to implement this important reform from the time when this reform was first announced. We have also amended two offence penalty provisions: first, where a licensee does not have a website that allows the consumer to generate a home loan key facts sheet and, second, where a licensee enters into a contract without having supplied a credit card key facts sheet to the borrower. Persons who breach these provisions will be liable for civil and criminal penalties, and the strict liability of the provisions are considered no longer necessary. This reflects the fact that sometimes lenders may commit a foot fault with some small technical breach despite having made every effort in good faith to comply. It is important that in these circumstances there is some discretion available to provide them with relief.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Next, it is proposed to amend the bill to allow consents given by consumers before 1 July 2012, when the law commences, to receive unsolicited credit limit invitations, to be relied upon. This change makes these reforms more workable for industry whilst still allowing invitations to be sent only to consumers who provide informed consent. Lastly, we have simplified the operation of the overlimit buffer reform. This amendment will make things simpler and easier to understand for consumers while preserving the strong level of protection that this critical reform provides. Lenders will also be required to notify consumers when they go over their credit limits and will not be able to charge a fee unless the consumer has given their express consent to being charged a fee. These are minor amendments but important changes to minimise the costs for industry and ensure strong protection for consumers.

                                              We will not oppose these amendments. These amendments represent a backdown from the government after the Treasurer sought to vilify me for having the matter referred to a committee and after he tried to spin to a journalist that we were, in fact, delaying the bill. Our concern was that the bill was starting too early. In fact, the government now recognises that with amendment (1). So I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas: that is the form of this government—it delivers a piece of legislation and consults afterwards, not before, and it seeks to ridicule and vilify any critic and then, when it realises the critic has actually got a fair point, it claims to be engaging actively with the community. So I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it does not surprise me that the Assistant Treasurer is in here doing the heavy lifting because the Treasurer himself has not got the courage to do it.

                                                     Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: if the Assistant Treasurer wants to be witty he would need to improve his skill base if he wants to be Prime Minister. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation; we recognise that and that is why we are not opposing it. But when it comes to some of the amendments, we are on the record as having actively encouraged some of these, and I give credit to the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann, who has been actively engaged in discussion on some of these matters. So we will not be opposing these amendments, because they do represent an improvement on the substantive bill. We will have more to say about the Greens amendment a little later.

But amendments (2) to (10) cannot be supported. It is another form of backdown.

                                                      It is notable that the strict liability provisions were not raised once in the report of the Standing

                                                      on Economics. The committee did not see fit to recommend any change to these provisions and one presumes that the committee thought that these provisions were important for the enforcement of some very important protections. One can only surmise what would have happened, but in the meantime lenders have come and lobbied the government and perhaps lobbied others and successfully managed to remove some of the strict liability provisions, despite the committee never having said that these provisions should be removed. In fact, the committee supported the passage of the bill as it stood.

                                                      The minister has said that the reason for the removal of the default and supplementary buffer is that it was sought by consumer groups. The committee heard that argument and the committee heard conflicting views. The committee heard from one charity that said that the default and supplementary buffer provisions that are now proposed to be removed were important and they did not believe, on balance, they should be removed and that they did not agree with the submission of the Australian Bankers Association that these ought to be removed because they said they were important protections for consumers.

                                                      Again, what has happened is that, since the report was tabled, some lobbying has presumably gone on and the Australian Bankers Association has got its way with respect to the removal of those parts of the default and supplementary buffers that are referred to in amendments (2) to (10). For that reason, whilst we support the bill, it is disappointing that a very good, welcome and important reform is at the eleventh hour being watered down after some last-minute lobbying by the banks.

                                                         This bill contains some very important reforms and very important protections. A credit card is something that millions of Australians have and use every day. For many people who are struggling to make their daily obligations, it has become something that they will use with some regularity and often to supplement their income. Many would be surprised to know that some of the reforms in this bill are necessary. I think many people would have assumed that, when they make their payment on their credit card, it goes to pay off the highest amount. Many people might have presumed that there were some prohibitions on fees that could be charged when people came up to their limits on their credit cards. To the extent that those reforms are being introduced, we welcome that.

                                                         That comes in the context where banks who are the providers of many of the credit cards are doing very well, with combined annual profits of $20 billion in the last year. On fees alone—not just credit card fees but all fees—the revenue raised in Australia is in the order of $5 billion per annum. In that context, moves to limit unfair fees that banks can charge are welcome. But many might also be surprised to know that this bill will not apply to existing credit cards. Those parts of the bill that apply to access limits and the order of payments—so the payments going to pay off the highest interest-earning components—do not apply to existing credit cards.

                                                         did not. They made the point—correctly in our view—that, although there might be some argument about compensation on just terms if you sought to deal with the way banks apply money for existing debts, there could be no argument made under the Constitution with respect to purchases made after the date of introduction of the bill. In other words, there is no legal constitutional barrier to having the provisions of this bill apply to purchases made after the bill comes into effect. That, of course, makes sense. These are not property rights that have accrued. It is a future transaction about which there is currently no regulation.

                                                         The amendment that we are moving would have the effect, without infringing any constitutional prohibition or without exposing the government to any claims for compensation, that most Australians would think this bill would have, and that is that it would apply to all new transactions on existing credit cards. If this amendment is not passed, although there will be some great headlines about the effects of these reforms, for the millions of Australians who currently have credit cards it will mean very little difference. They will continue to pay unfair fees and when they make their payments on their credit cards it will not necessarily go to those parts that are accruing the highest debts. It is very easily fixed. The National Australia Bank agrees that it can be done, and I would urge members of this House to support these amendments because it will make a very real difference to everyday Australians.

                                                          increases protections for consumers by banning over-limit fees, by making payment allocations fair and by banning unsolicited credit limit increase offers. Whilst I understand the spirit of the member for Melbourne's amendments, the government has strong advice that the amendments pose a serious exposure to taxpayers. As I am sure the member for Melbourne is aware, our Constitution prohibits the compulsory acquisition of rights other than on just terms. As lenders have accrued rights invested in existing credit card contracts, any changes to those rights may be considered a breach of that clause of the Constitution. Such a breach could result in taxpayers being required to compensate lenders in huge amounts, which I am sure is not the intention of the member for Melbourne. The government is seeking to ensure that taxpayers are not exposed to this risk. That means that we cannot support the member for Melbourne's amendment.

It should be a salient lesson for him that he cannot run with the hares and the hounds in this place. He will actually have to form some partnerships, if he really does want to get something through—

The court's establishment followed a series of Senate committee reports, over a number of years, recommending extensive changes to the system of military justice.

The interim military justice system was established under the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009. We were told by then Minister Faulkner—second out of a line of three defence ministers in this government over four years—when it was introduced that rectifying the military legal problem would be 'afforded the government's highest priority'. If it was afforded the government's highest priority, then why are we back here two years later extending the provisions with the Military Justice (Interim Measures)

It got to a point where, over a month, there were 10 wars that he was fighting across the domestic continent of Australia. But, not content to just stop at the war fighting, he then said, 'My No. 1 priority is dealing with obesity; my first priority is dealing with X.' He had 10 No. 1 priorities. Is it any wonder that, 12 months ago to the date in two days time, the Labor Party rose up in historic form and knifed him, not because he was behind in the polls but because they, frankly, hated him? That is a statement of fact: 10 wars, 10 No. 1 priorities, none of them going anywhere; and here we have another highest priority, military justice.

When a Minister for Defence speaks in the House of Representatives, the world listens. Not only is there a $26 billion budget but, when you add on $12 billion in terms of vets, you are talking about $38 billion worth of expenditure and the senior elected repre­sentative of a middle power with significant regional interest. When the Minister for Defence speaks, the world listens. When he says it is his highest priority, we would expect that to be honoured.

                                                               Keeping military matters in mind, in 2007—I look at the member for Moreton, who came in in 2007—the government said in the election campaign that one of its highest priorities was to address the fairness of the indexation of defence pensions. Where are we after four years of that being a high priority? Where are we, Member for Moreton? Where are we, Member for Fremantle? Where are we on that high priority? In fact, to save your bacon, the coalition introduced a private senator's bill in the Senate. When we went to the election saying it was our highest priority, we actually acted on it. We stood up and acted on our highest priority. We put a private senator's bill into the Senate. Where was the Labor Party? It was voting against it, which was odd because I put a motion into the House asking the House to reaffirm its commitment to the fair indexation of military pensions and to support the Senate bill and it passed on the voices. Where was the Labor Party then in dealing with this high priority? As we address this issue of military justice, let everyone know that we are here because this government is completely, intolerably and utterly incapable of exercising a commitment to what the defence minister said was the highest priority—not just a high priority but the highest priority. It is funny how priorities change, because here we are two years later.

                                                               Clearly the minister's statement was about buying time for a government that had lost its way, or so we were told 12 months ago. This is a government that does not have a clear strategy on how to deal with the issue of military justice. This also builds on so many other missteps and misfortunes this government has created when it comes to our fighting force. It was dragged kicking and screaming to put counter rocket, artillery and mortar into the battlefield, the C-

The government was told about the issues with the air warfare destroyer, but still there was no action until it was sprayed across the front of the papers. We are seeing $2½ billion of the defence budget handed back because apparently the government cannot spend it. Yet, in the Howard years, an average of something like 30 projects went through first and second pass approvals. What has the government been doing in the last one, two and three years in first and second pass approvals? Seven, eight and nine, a third less than the Howard government, and you wonder why there is an underspend out there in defence industry.

We are now at a point where Force 2030 is unachievable. Something like $14 billion worth of defence procurement has been pushed to the right, some of it into years that have not been disclosed, so this government can try to stand up next financial year, 2012-13, and say, 'Look, we've got a wafer-thin surplus,' a surplus built on the back of destroying Australian defence industry and deferring $14 billion worth of projects. It is one more example of a long litany of defence failures. The defence minister said fixing up the

The amendment, at least at face value, is necessary because schedule 3 of the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No.1) 2009 currently provides a fixed tenure for the statutory office holders, the Chief Judge Advocate and two Judge Advocates, of up to two years that will expire in September 2011. This bill amends schedule 3 of that act to provide for the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for an additional two years or until the Minister for Defence puts in place the legislation to establish a properly constituted court.

It is 12 months since fundamental injustice day, 12 months since the government lost its way. The Prime Minister's three priorities are still nowhere. All we have learnt is that the Prime Minister's highest priorities simply do not get any priority and the Minister for Defence's highest priorities get zero priority. That is a fabulous analogy for this wretched government—moribund, rotten and incapable of actually setting an agenda or a vision for the nation; setting priorities it does not keep and setting agendas it has no hope of ever reaching. It is disappointing that we once again find ourselves passing another stopgap measure. Senator Faulkner's second reading speech reads:

Numerous military professionals have come out opposing some concepts of where the government is going. There is no ostensible discussion paper to provide advice as to the direction it might head and no comments out there with respect to where we might go.

Jan Boyd-Turner was a quintessential eastern suburbs Liberal supp­orter. She was a lifelong Liberal but in no way was she a one-eyed Liberal who always believed that the party was right. She spent her entire adult life as a member of the Liberal Party, as president of the local Leabrook branch, as president of the Bragg state electorate committee, as a very active member of my campaigns, and Ian Wilson's before me, and as an active member of the Liberal Women's Council. But she was not a person who simply accepted the party's positions. In the latter years of her life and also in the latter years of the Howard government she gave me a very hard time about asylum seekers and the government's approach to them. I very much welcomed her contributions to my federal electorate council and also to the local branch. She was a marvellous fundraiser. She welded together a wonderful group of women in the eastern suburbs. She was the mother of nine children, six from her husband's first marriage and three of her own, all of whom she has raised to be terrific adults and a marvellous family.

The Australian government recently confirmed it remained committed to the pilot scheme, which is due to run out on 30 June 2012.
                                                                  </p>

                                                                   Recent changes were designed to make the scheme more flexible and better reflect the needs of the horticulture sector to fill unmet demand while ensuring that Pacific seasonal workers will continue to make financial benefits during their stay in Australia. I have seen the scheme working most effectively at the 2PH citrus orchard at Emerald, in the electorate of Flynn, which has been employing Pacific islanders to assist with its seasonal harvests and has found them to be keen, happy and efficient workers in an industry where Australian workers are very hard to find. Some Tongans working at 2PH escaped the recent tsunami, which devastated their villages. These workers pay their taxes in Australia. They benefit, we benefit, the growers benefit and their home countries benefit, so I would like to see this scheme continue beyond the projected pilot period ending 30 June 2012. Changes introduced to the system have meant better things for these workers, and I would like to encourage the program to continue.

But the Arab Spring, which has seen uprisings against dictatorships in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain, is dawning in Syria, too, as the people there express their desire for freedom and dignity, which expression has been met with a deadly response.
                                                                   </p>

More than 1,000 protesters have been killed and more than 10,000 have been arrested, or have disappeared, according to rights organis­ations.

The regime has shown that there are no limits on what it is willing to do to prevent the truth from getting out. It has blamed the killings and violence on 'armed gangs' and 'extremists and terrorists' but has offered little more than transparent fabrications to justify its actions. The sense of impunity within the security forces is so great that they even return bodies that bear signs of torture, including those of children, to families.

Military dogs provide invaluable service to our defence forces. The discipline and precision of the dogs on parade at the Salisbury service was a credit to their handlers. The service was a fitting recognition of them.

This opportunity allows participants to improve their health and fitness, develop self-confidence and improve their social capacity.

I would also like to recognise the important contribution of Michael's mother, Diane, and his coach, Helen Stevens, in providing a launching pad for Michael to pursue his love of soccer and to represent this nation. Michael will make an outstanding ambassador for our nation and, indeed, for the people of Macquarie.

In 2010, 330 Australians lost their lives because of the ongoing crisis in the road transport industry. The National Transport Commission's 2008 landmark report on addressing safety on our roads found that:

He has risen above it, integrated into our society and given so much back to our community. Graham is a quadriplegic with no movement from his neck down and has been so since a tragic sporting accident at the age of 24 in 1980.

I was immensely impressed by his unending passion for the welfare of others. Today I pay tribute to his fighting spirit and amazing reservoir of strength. He is an example to all of us to never give up and never give in, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Graham, you never stop championing the welfare of others. You give so much and you have taught me so much. I thank you and salute you. You are a true hero.

The biggest topic of conversation in the Illawarra at the moment is the renewal of the existing contract this year, keeping seven games for the mighty Illawarra Dragons in the Illawarra. Without this minimum number of games, the local fans would be severely disappointed. It is important for the local economy and important to ensuring that the Illawarra's overwhelming contribution to making the mighty Illawarra Dragons one of the best teams in the competition will be recognised. So I call upon the Dragons to ensure the Illawarra gets a fair shake at the number of home games we get to see.

What I was required to do in my capacity as the relevant minister was to work with state and territory colleagues around the country to enter an agreement which would enable parliaments around the country to enact model laws and then enable those model laws to be followed up with the required codes and regulations, which would mean that wherever you were in the country, wherever you worked, as a working person you would have the benefits of the same protections and standards and that, as an employer, you would not have to engage with different regimes in different parts of the country.

That was a very important moment of microeconomic reform, 30 years in the seeking, which was then delivered through that agreement between ministers, and that agreement is being actioned. The only problem, of course, with actioning that agreement has been the issues of the Liberal government in

First and foremost, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he really thinks these major microeconomic reforms are so easy, why wasn't it achieved under the Howard government? In 11 long years, this microeconomic reform was never achieved under the Howard government.

She asked me about the government's policies and plans to keep our economy strong. Mr Speaker, let me assure you and the House that there is nothing more important to this government than keeping the economy strong so Australians have the benefits and dignity of work.
                                                                                     </p>

To keep our economy strong for the long term, we need to rebuild. I am proud that we were able to work through to structure a progressive flood levy to fund the rebuilding. I am also pleased that we were able to find the tough cutbacks necessary to rebuild Queensland and the nation.

Of course they need jobs, but they also need great quality education services. Along with our schools reforms, childcare reforms and university reforms, I am pleased we were able to deliver the $3 billion skills package in the recent budget. I am pleased that we have been able to strike a breakthrough health agreement to ensure that there are more doctors, more nurses, more local control and less waste. I am also pleased that we have been able to work with Australian families to slightly alleviate the cost-of-living pressures they face, with new money for families of teenagers and with school uniforms being added to the Education Tax Refund program to take a little bit of the pressure off.

We are driven by getting results for the Australian nation, unlike those opposite, who are always diverted by the politics and the cheap political stunts.

Over the course of the last several years we have had to deal with certain legacy problems from those opposite. I draw the attention of honourable members to, for example, the relationship with Indonesia. I remember, as a member of this place within the last decade, an Indonesian government that would not pick up the phone to Prime Minister Howard, an Indonesian government that just opened the doors when it came to the flow of people through the Indonesia archipelago and a whole range of other measures by the then

                                                                                              </a>

                                                                                             </p>

On the question of the negotiations in which the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is currently engaged, we have together contributed processes such as the Bali process, which for the first time brings about a regional framework agreement and for the first time incorporates international legal standards into the way in which we operate assessment centres and undertake processing within our neighbourhood. On top of that, it provides specifically for the existence of assessment centres in the region, the first of 13 regions around the world to arrive at such an agreement. That has been made possible because we have an excellent fabric of relationships upon which to build such arrangements.
                                                                                             </p>

If anyone bothered to survey the detail of that in terms of Australia's ongoing engagement on the ground in Dili and the overall development program within East Timor, they would understand what is being invested in roads, what is being invested in hospitals, what is being invested in schools and the fact that we stand solidly by the people of East Timor in the long-term economic development of that country.

These bills will deliver on our commitment to bring the budget back in the black and will ensure that we see more Australians in work than ever before. There is nothing that we on this side of the House are prouder of than the fact that so many Australians are in work. Over the past year we have had a very strong job creation record and we are expecting the creation of a further half a million jobs over the next couple of years.
                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                    Returning the budget to surplus is vital so that we do not compound the price pressures which will come with the investment boom. We must bring our budget back to surplus so we can have strong, sustainable growth for the long term. You cannot return the budget to surplus unless you constrain spending growth and put in place savings, which is why we have restricted real spending growth to one per cent on average. That compares to 3.7 per cent under those opposite at the height of mining boom mark 1. I was somewhat surprised to see a couple of days ago the shadow Treasurer attack the spending spree that the previous government went on at the height of mining boom mark 1 because that was a spending spree which put pressure on inflation and saw interest rates go up 10 times in a row. There is a stark contrast between the approach of those previously in government and what we are doing. We are putting in place very substantial savings. In this budget, there is $22 billion worth of savings. That is absolutely essential to strong economic management and maintaining strong growth, particularly job creation growth.
                                                                                                   </p>

But this can only be done if our savings pass the parliament. Those opposite are currently blocking something like $6 billion worth of savings, having already opposed in this House something like $7 billion worth of savings, including one measure to do with alternative fuels which was a measure of the previous government. The fact is that you cannot keep saying that you support a return to surplus while trying to block the savings which will actually deliver the surplus. What they would be doing with this approach if they were in power is delivering deficits right across the forward estimates. They are still trying to wreck the surplus and all of the consequences of that for jobs.

We on this side of the House have a strong economic policy which supports strong job growth. For those on that side of the House, when it comes to economic policy, the cupboard is simply bare. We find this is the case when it comes to the reform of our banking sector. This government is committed to a stable and competitive banking sector, which is why we were absolutely stunned by the effort of the shadow Treasurer and those opposite to bring back mortgage exit fees. They claim to be concerned about the cost of living, but in their attempt to bring back unfair mortgage exit fees they are pushing up the cost of living for thousands of Australians.

While I respect your ruling in relation to this question, I would make the following points: (1) there are precedents for this question going over many decades; (2) previous Speakers have allowed such questions in the past; and (3) there is no argument, no debate in this question—it is a completely straight question to the chair, as you are well aware. So I take it from what you have just said that you have decided, as the Speaker in this parliament, that no such questions will be allowed.

It has been acknowledged that there is a narrow window of opportunity to ask other members questions about matters for which they are responsible. One of the overarching reasons for my decision, which I believe is important, is that if the member for Sturt were to read page 537 he would understand that it would be inappropriate, given the conventions of the way in which we conduct our committee system, for a chair—even if there had been discussions—to report matters not previously reported to the chamber and to do so without discussing it with the committee. That is the point that is clearly made on page 537.

I would point out to you that there could be nothing narrower than asking whether a chair has been requested by the government or intends to seek a reference, but I take it from what you have said that you have decided that chairs will not be asked such questions. While we abide by your ruling, it is out of step with the precedent that was established in 1957. But you are the Speaker and we accept your decision.

The Gillard government is delivering on a regional framework to both break the people smugglers' business model and improve protection outcomes for genuine refugees across the region. As part of this, of course, we have reached an agreement with Malaysia that will see 800 asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia while Australia resettles 4,000 refugees over the next four years.

The opposition says that we are resettling too many refugees from Malaysia and that is unfair. We disagree. We say that it would be unfair not to. I am asked about the role that visits to Malaysia have played in this process. It is the case that in the nine months I have been Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I have been to Malaysia four times to discuss, with not only ministerial counterparts but Malaysian line agencies, models which could improve our system of breaking the people smugglers' business model. I have been discussing with the

I thought: 'Maybe this is a good thing. Maybe this shows he is reconsidering his position. Maybe if he goes to Malaysia he might change his mind about the government resettling 4,000 people from Malaysia over the next four years. He might think that is a good idea. He might see, if there are appropriate protections in place, that the transfer of people from Australia to Malaysia is a good thing. This might be a genuine fact-finding mission.' But, alas, it will shock the House to learn that that is not the case. This is not a genuine fact-finding mission. It is a stunt. He has said that, no matter what he sees in Malaysia, it will not change his mind. I have said that this is a stunt that will go down in the

It is hard to think of a bigger stunt than going to another country to attack this government and that government, except perhaps for calling a plebiscite which is not going to change your mind either. That might be bigger. That is an argument the House might want to have.

That is how negative this opposition has become. This underlines the hypocrisy of the opposition. This hypocrisy goes to several levels. We know that the member for Cook has suggested a transfer arrangement, not with Malaysia—in fairness—but with Iran. We know that. But there has been an interesting development.

I will make the point again that we can grow strongly and we can at the same time substantially reduce carbon pollution. We can do that and we must do that if we are going to be a prosperous economy into the future. All of the modelling, all of the evidence and all of the reports that we have received show a number of things. They show that economic growth will remain strong. They also show that incomes growth will remain strong. They also show that jobs growth will remain strong. They show all of those things and they also show that the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. They show that we can be a prosperous, growing economy where industries like the sugar industry do well.

We know that we have a very strongly growing resource sector in that state, with very strong investment. We know that a carbon price will in no way endanger those industries. Those industries will be strong. Those industries will continue to grow and they will continue to grow because many of the investors in those industries have already factored a carbon price into their investments. We know all of those things.

They know that other countries are moving to reduce their carbon pollution. They know that we are a great trading nation and that, if we do not take action in this area into the future, many of our great export industries could be in danger of trade sanctions from other countries. So, whether it is the sugar industry or whether it is the coal industry, everybody has a stake in putting in place a price on carbon so we can grow responsibly and reduce our carbon pollution.

It was built around the principle of recognising the importance of collective bargaining, of requiring the parties to bargain in good faith and ensuring that, where differences could not be resolved, they would go to an independent umpire. Not only did this reintroduce fairness to the system; it also underpinned the prosperity that this nation has experienced over the last three years, with increased jobs—some 740,000, as the Treasurer has talked about, with half a million more in prospect. We have seen a fall in industrial disputes and we have seen economic growth and wages growth.

Is the Prime Minister aware that in all states, on the 25 per cent of land supposedly owned by first Australians, it is not legally possible to own land? There is no provision for the issuance of a title deed. In light of the recent death of Eddie Holroyd, the last holder of a title deed issued under the Queensland lands act amendment (Aboriginal), abolished in 1993, could the Prime Minister assure the House that the work of Holroyd, Shortjoe and Edwards, who took Pormpuraaw cattle numbers from 363 to 6,000, will not be in vain and that title deeds, the only pathway to economic development, will be provided? Or are our first Australians going to continue to be the only people on earth still deprived of the right to own their own home?

The member for Kennedy has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions privately, and I know that he is very concerned about it and it has been something that he has pursued across a lifetime of political work, not only here in this parliament but in the Queensland state parliament beforehand. I know that when he was Queensland state Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he introduced far-reaching land reforms to try and assist with this question of title. Even today these leases that he created when he was the relevant minister are known as 'Katter leases', and I think that is a great tribute to him. It was one of the first attempts to harness the land to enable economic development for Aboriginal people, and I know he is proud of it.

In Queensland the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Islander Land Act 1991 were amended in 2008 to allow long-term leasing of up to 99 years of community title land for private residential and commercial purposes. No 99-year leases have been entered into as yet, as the necessary survey work needs to be done.

And the proposed amendments also provide measures for regularising these estates with the balance of Indigenous lands to facilitate further economic development.

                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               So I understand that, from the point of view of the member for Kennedy, progress in this matter has been painfully slow, because he did such good work when he was in the Queensland parliament. I know that he is aware that there is a need here to work with community ownership structures but to give sufficient security to private individuals such that they are able to have homes, and have a connection to their homes in the same way Australians generally want that connection with the place they call home, and to have the ability to develop viable businesses that can then be sold so that the labour that you put into your business not only supports you in an income sense but also builds up capital for you when you want to realise that capital. So we are working through that with the Queensland government; we will continue to do so. I can understand the member for Kennedy's frustration that he would like to see quicker progress, but progress is occurring.

When the government's paid parental leave scheme started on 1 January this year Australia finally caught up with the rest of the developed world. It has been a very, very long time coming. Australian families have waited decades for this historic reform. And of course it is a fundamental reform that was delivered by this Labor government, a reform that so many people in our community campaigned for and is now operating.
                                                                                                                                </p>

                                                                                                                                 Since the scheme began 65,000 new and expecting parents have claimed parental leave. Right now more than 30,000 new parents are receiving the government's paid parental leave, so there are 30,000 families benefiting. The good news is that Australian businesses are also playing their part. Employers have been able to register since 1 January and also start providing government funded paid parental leave to their long-term employees. We now have more than 8,000 employers already registered and 400 employers playing their part, providing government funded paid parental leave to their employees. The employer role will be fully implemented from 1 July, so very soon we will have the full implementation of this part of the paid parental leave scheme—and I would encourage all employers to register and get ready for the benefits that will flow as they are able to provide paid parental leave to their long-term employees. I think we know, and employers who are already using the scheme know, it does provide great benefits to their employees. We know that women return to work after taking time off for their babies, and they are much more likely to do that if they receive paid parental leave.
                                                                                                                                </p>

We will make sure that they get their money upfront from the government and that they are able to pay their employees using their usual pay cycle. They will not have to have any special accounts or any special reports. One of the things that the Minister for Human Services and I did yesterday was release a toolkit for employers so that they have more information available for them and they know what they can do from 1 July.

We also know that in doing that our economy does have to make a transition, because we have to reduce emissions and we have to do it particularly when it involves some of those institutions, such as power stations, which are emitting very large amounts of carbon pollution. Those on that side of the House, in name anyway, share something in common with the government—that is, they have a commitment to reduce emissions by up to five per cent. So everybody in this House knows that we will have to reduce our emissions, particularly from those power stations which are least efficient. That is well known by everybody on both sides of the House, and we should stop the hypocrisy that is coming from that side of the House, which somehow pretends that there will not be some actions taken in this area.
                                                                                                                                     </p>

We are absolutely committed to that. We are absolutely committed to assisting our energy-intensive trade-exposed industries in that transition. So we have said very clearly about the revenue which will be raised from a price on carbon that it will go to households but also to industry. We have made that very clear because we, unlike many on that side of the House, understand and believe in the science of climate change and we cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore this challenge. So with us you will get a clear plan for the future which will assist households and a clear plan for the future which will assist industry. That stands in stark—

And I have not had a single question from the health spokesperson opposite about any one of these investments. Why is that? Why have there been no questions? Because the Leader of the Opposition, as the health minister, did not fix these problems. It has been our government, with a deal that was reached by the Prime Minister in April this year that has enabled us to deliver these reforms. Look at some other investments: the specialists that are being funded to be trained, particularly in rural and regional Australia, where I know that our crossbench members are particularly interested—518 specialists, more than half of whom are now working in rural and regional areas. That is a ninefold increase from when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. I have not had a single question about these investments. Why? Because these investments matter to patients, these investments matter to consumers, and the Liberal Party are more interested in their petty politics than they are interested in delivering to patients across the country.

I refer the Prime Minister to her 7 May announcement that a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia would be concluded in the near future. Given that it is over seven weeks since then, why did she rush to announce something as important as this before critical issues surrounding human rights had been resolved and before agreement had been reached about the repatriation of unaccompanied minors and asylum seekers without identification? Is it not time that she swallowed her pride and asked the foreign minister for some help?

So far much is occurring: 6,627 kilometres of roads have been repaired of the 9,170 kilometres damaged; 4,421 of rail repaired of a total of 4,748; 411 schools have been re-opened and 11 ports; and, in the member for Capricornia's electorate, with the Queensland government we have given $900,000 to the

To have achieved so much in such a relatively short period of time is quite remarkable. That is a tribute to governments of all persuasions around the country working in partnerships and with non-government organisations. Wherever possible we are focusing on betterment—that is, ensuring that any repair and reconstruction work is at a higher standard. This is going to make our country in turn more resilient and in the future more capable of preventing, responding to and recovering from natural disasters that are a natural part of our environment.

                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

I want to break the very business model for the business that they ply. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister and the member who asked the question want to send a much weaker message to people smugglers. I will leave them with the weaker policy. The government will pursue the stronger policy. The stronger policy is a transfer agreement. The stronger policy is being able to say to people smugglers and to asylum seekers, 'If you risk your life at sea, if you pay your money to a people smuggler, you end up at the back of the queue in Malaysia.' The message that the opposition wants to send is, 'If you risk your life at sea, if you pay a people smuggler, you will go to Nauru for a period of time and then end up in Australia.' That is why it is a weaker message. So we will pursue the stronger approach to border protection. We will leave the member who asked the question and the Leader of the Opposition with the much weaker approach.

The fact is that this government has already delivered more education reform than the Howard government managed in over a decade and since coming into office it has proceeded to rebuild, from the Commonwealth, school education after a decade of ignorance and neglect from those opposite. We have almost doubled the investment in education to some $64.9 billion. Australian students are now studying in new libraries and classrooms as a consequence of a $16 billion investment in school infrastructure—24,000 projects at 9,500 schools across Australia. We have introduced Australia's first national curriculum: English, maths, science and history from kindergarten to year 12, with geography, languages and arts to follow. We have introduced Australia's first national teacher standards. For the first time teachers will be identified on the basis of quality in a national system. We are introducing Australia's first national bonus pay system for the best and brightest of those teachers with $425 million to make sure that teachers are recognised and rewarded. And we are investing some $480 million to empower local schools. We know that local communities and school principals have an idea about what will work best and we trust them to make those decisions.
                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                                                                                        We are rewarding schools that make the most difference to our students through the $165 million Reward for School Improvement program. Of course, there is $2.5 billion available in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, identifying our most disadvantaged students, including our Indigenous students, so that they can improve in key areas of literacy and numeracy. This is investment by this government that is transforming schools and changing lives. If you add the 430,000 computers and the $2.5 billion in the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, you will get a strong and clear idea of the level of investment and commitment to education that this government has.

They want to cut $2.8 billion out of the education budget. The fact is that for over a decade they managed 3,000 flagpoles; we are supporting some 3,000 libraries. Our commitment to education recognises that it is the great enabler. This government will continue to produce the commitment, the policies and the support to make sure that every school is a great school. That is right at the heart of this government's agenda.

I refer the Prime Minister to the member for Griffith's promise in 2009 to provide $2.8 million to 'establish a dedicated border protection committee of cabinet. This would drive the government's response to the people-smuggling threat.' Can the Prime Minister explain to the House why one of her first acts as Prime Minister was to eliminate the border protection committee of cabinet?

The fact is that the CER agreement is a gold-standard agreement. An investment agreement that was reached just earlier this year between the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand will further deepen our economic integration.

We do know that the government of New Zealand has put a price on carbon and is establishing a domestic carbon market. In Australia, the government is determined to put a price on carbon and establish a domestic carbon market. In the spirit of the CER agreement there is in fact great potential to establish an Australia-New Zealand carbon market, and what a good thing that would be.

I am asked about the risks to such a market. The truth is that the opposition leader would destroy that stability by abandoning an emissions trading scheme. He says: 'Yes, that is right. Believe me, I would abandon an emissions trading scheme.' Well, let us turn to his statements. In the middle of July 2009 the now opposition leader was urging the then opposition leader, the member for Wentworth—wait for it—to support the Labor government's emissions trading scheme. He wrote in an opinion piece:

He is not a Leader of the Opposition, he is a captain of a permanent debating society, and the case he always prosecutes is, 'No, no, no, no and no.'

Remember the Medicare safety net? He would not change that; it was an iron-clad, rolled-gold, rock-solid promise. Well, he changed it all right. Now he is saying that he will not touch the mining tax. He will get rid of the mining tax. But the truth is that if he were to win government I would not be too happy if I were

This is incorrect on both counts. I have spoken in parliament on the live cattle exports issue on three occasions over the past three weeks. A reading of my speeches will reveal that I have made no criticisms of Australian farmers whatsoever. On the other hand, I have expressly raised the issue of religion, stating religious convictions do not give anyone a licence to depart from basic standards of decency and humanity.

In fact it will be eight weeks this Saturday. Late on a Saturday afternoon, just after 2.30—the usual time for ministers to make very important announcements of government policy—she gathered the media together to announce this proposed agree­ment. She was so excited about this agreement that on 7 May she twittered: 'Have reached agreement with the

She was so excited about it that, on 8 May, she twittered again: 'We're a generous country. We'll do what we can to stop the evil of people smuggling.' And then again on 8 May—she was not finished—she twittered again and sent a message for people smugglers.

I did go and check the other tweets as to what she might have been talking about since then, and she was happy to talk about a whole range of matters. I noticed in particular that the Prime Minister retwittered the Treasurer, 'Swanny

She was happy to retweet the Deputy Prime Minister, but when I went through all of those 30-odd tweets since her first one, there was one member of the government that she had not retwittered. I wonder who that was. I wonder who it was that the Prime Minister did not want to retweet. There is one minister in the government that the Prime Minister did not want to retweet, and that was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There was no retweet for the Minister for Foreign Affairs that talked about the progress that they were making and the efforts that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been making to get this historic agreement with Malaysia over the line. We could not find it because the foreign minister had not been doing it and, even if he had, the last person on earth that this Prime Minister would retweet would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Jones: 'Weeks?' The minister: 'Yes, we're talking weeks.' That was about 20 days ago. So we will see whether it is weeks or months, but we will see. At least the minister at the table—and here I give him credit—was prepared to talk about time frames for the completion of this significant agreement.

Prime Minister: 'Well, we're working with Malaysia to get all the details of the agreement right, the discussion et cetera, et cetera.' Fran Kelly: 'Days, the weekend?' Prime Minister: 'Fran, I'm not here to announce time frames. We are working very well with our Malaysian counterparts.' Some weeks before she was very happy to talk about time frames. She was very happy to talk about imminent announcements, but some eight weeks later this deal has still not been done and this government is not being upfront or transparent with the Australian people about what is involved in this agreement.

This is a difficult area of policy and the decisions you make in this area of policy have significant implications for individual human beings. All of us, I expect, understand this and understand it only too well. But what is a problem here and what concerns me is that when this agreement was entered into and rushed out the door late on a Saturday afternoon before the budget, critical issues had not been addressed, and critical issues had not been resolved. These fundamental issues included the question: 'Will people be caned?' The minister made all sorts of comments about what he may have said—weeks and weeks and weeks after the event. But, at that time, there was no indication at all that the issue of caning had been resolved.

The Australian people want answers about this arrangement. Among those questions are the following: would children who were sent by this minister to Malaysia under this agreement go to public schools in Malaysia? It is a pretty basic question. I put that question to him only last week and there was no response. With the 800 who are sent to Malaysia, where will they receive their hospital treatment? Where will they go to hospital? How long will they stay in Malaysia? The minister at the table is all too quick to talk about how long people spend in detention, even though under this government's administration the average time spent in detention has increased threefold. No wonder we average three critical incidents every single day in our detention network. The time in detention has tripled. This minister is all too happy to talk about time spent in detention, but I have a simple question for the minister: how long will people stay in Malaysia under this agreement? Also, how long will the funds provided for under this agreement last to support those people while they are in Malaysia? Is the answer six weeks? Is it six months? Is it six years? Is it 20 years? The minister well knows that it is an actual consequence that could take place as a result of the agreement that he has brought into this place, and that is something which the minister needs to be upfront with the Australian people about. He needs to be transparent with the Australian people about the real implications for individual human beings from his decision to enter into this agreement.

RELA members have the right to carry arms and arrest anyone reasonably believed to be an undesirable person, an illegal immigrant or an occupier. The regulations authorise RELA members to question suspects and enter premises, either public or private, without obtaining a search warrant, where there is reason to believe suspects are housed. Should a suspect refuse to answer questions, produce requested identification or comply with reasonable requests or should they make a statement or produce a document that the RELA member believes may be false—so it is up to the RELA member to determine whether documentation or tags are true—then RELA personnel may arrest them. No warrant is necessary. The same amendment referred to here in this document gives effective legal immunity to RELA members so that they cannot be prosecuted for any act or omission done in good faith in their capacity as RELA officials.

This is the desk evidence that is there and available to us, and these are the questions that I still cannot get an answer to from this minister. Frankly, if the minister is not prepared to answer these questions in this place for the Australian people, then I am prepared to try to go and get those answers for myself. I am prepared to go to Malaysia and find out from my own on-the-ground research and to see the circumstances into which people will be sent under this government.

Never has a government been so obsessed with an opposition as this government has. We have a Prime Minister obsessed with the Leader of the Opposition. We have a minister for immigration obsessed with the shadow minister for immigration, constantly craving my praise for his initiatives as he walks in here saying, 'Why won't he praise me?' I will tell you why I will not praise him. I will tell you why this opposition will not praise this minister. It is because he is overseeing an absolute farce. In his rush to this deal, in his anything-but-Nauru strategy, the minister at the table knows that he is embracing the unthinkable in Malaysia. So we will go to Malaysia and we will seek to understand the circumstances for those who will be sent there and those who will live there.

The Australian people would love to give this government a chance to see if it can do opposition better than this opposition can, to see if this government can do in opposition what it thinks it can do in government, because this government is obsessed with the opposition. I am quite happy for this side of the chamber to give the government a chance to be the opposition it truly wants to be. That is what the Australian people want, and if the minister wants to have a chat with the Prime Minister then I am sure that can be arranged at an election at some time soon.

The Malaysian government have a right to act within their borders to address the challenges that they have, according to their laws and according to the international obligations that they have signed up to. That is for the Malaysian government. My problem is with this government. My problem is with a government that has decided to send 800 people into that situation. In that situation we need to understand what it will mean if we are going to take that decision. I encourage the minister to undertake exactly the same visit I will undertake this weekend. I will go there to understand, and I will take the advice that Mr Thom gave to the Prime Minister when he said:

Graham Thom, the head of Amnesty International on these issues, does not think it is a stunt when it comes to understanding the conditions faced by women in Malaysia, and neither do I. This government has a better alternative available to it, but it simply refuses to take it up, for no other reason than political pride. Nauru and temporary protection visas are more cost effective and more humane and, as the government and the Australian people all know, it is the proven alternative. Pick up the phone.

What the opposition is really concerned about is that when you pull the rug out from under the people smugglers' business model you pull the rug out from under the business model of cheap slogans.

That is what this shadow minister is really concerned about.

The question that asylum seekers and people smugglers would have to ask themselves is, 'Why would I pay the money and risk my life to be returned to where I began that boat journey?' That is why this proposal from the government breaks the people smugglers' business model in a way that no action taken by the Liberal Party ever did when they were in office. Nothing the Liberal Party did when they were in office could remove the guarantee of being resettled in Australia.

But the opposition had the chance—again, 15 minutes—to answer some fundamental questions on Nauru. We will come back to that. Again, we saw those questions unanswered. The opposition have said for years that Nauru is the answer, but they have not provided any details or substance to that. What we saw is more hypocrisy from the shadow minister for immigration.

Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister say: 'It is outrageous that we would take 4,000 people out of Malaysia. It is unfair. Why would we take so many refugees from Malaysia?' The Leader of the Opposition said in this House at the dispatch box last week:

'Turn it around. Send it back to Indonesia.' Turning back the boats means that they would be sent to Indonesia when Indonesia have said they will not accept them. The Indonesian government said, 'We will not accept boats that are returned from Australia,' when the opposition made that policy. The shadow minister said, 'No, that was in response to your policy announce­ment.' When the opposition announced in the election campaign that they would turn back the boats, the foreign minister of Indonesia said, 'We won't take them.' That was not in response to anything the government said. It was in response to a policy announcement from the Leader of the Opposition that he would have a phone on which he would take control of the Navy and personally order the return of the boats. That is their policy—turn back the boats to Indonesia.

If you are going to turn back the boats to Indonesia, what protections are you going to have in place for the people returned to Indonesia? When you drop them off at the jetty in Indonesia are the kids going to be able to go to school? If they need to go to hospital, where are they going to go? What protections are going to be in place? How long will they be there? All the questions that the shadow minister asked about Malaysia he cannot answer about Indonesia, which is where they would return the boats to—putting aside the fact that Indonesia have said they will not take the boats and that it would risk the lives of asylum seekers and our naval personnel.

That is not okay and it is unfair, according to the opposition, but it is okay on the high seas to turn the boats around, risk the lives of sailors and asylum seekers and drop them off at a jetty in Jakarta and say, 'See you later,' with no protections in place whatsoever. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition.
                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

Then the member for Cook said, 'Read the speech.' I will do better. I will read it to the House. This is what the member for Cook said in November:
                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

The member for Cook's solution was proposed last November. He said, 'I've got this great idea: a real international solution that will involve Australia returning people to Iran,' because they are strong on human rights in Iran! Perhaps the member for Cook is about to announce a fact-finding mission to Tehran where he can outline the protections that are in place under his agreement. I would be interested to see it. I am not going to Iran because I have no interest in doing a transfer agreement with Iran. You do, and you can go to Iran.

He has appointed himself ombudsman for asylum seekers in the region. Our old friend the ombudsman, as the member for Chifley likes to call him, has appointed himself ombudsman to ensure their conditions are protected because he cares so much about asylum seekers. This is a man and a party who would send people to Nauru, a country that would not grant visas to people who wanted to monitor the situation when we had over 1,000 asylum seekers, who were Australia's responsibility, in Nauru. If a journalist wanted a visa—denied. If a lawyer wanted a visa—denied. Nobody else could go to Nauru but, while the member for Cook thinks it is so important that he goes to Malaysia, he was willing to send people to a country which would not issue visas to people interested in pursuing and monitoring the situation in Nauru. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition.
                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                               Then we hear them say that it is more humane to send people to Nauru than to Malaysia. That is something which really takes the cake. The opposition go around taking any opportunity to criticise the support and care that is given to people who are asylum seekers in Australia. They take any opportunity to say they are getting too much—their pillows are too fluffy, they get Foxtel, they get telephones so they can ring their family members. How outrageous that this happens!
                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

They say that Nauru would be more humane. The only way the Nauru option provides any disincentives to come to Australia is the fact it left people on Nauru for an inordinately long period of time. We saw the effects of that. People were assessed by psychiatrists appointed by the previous government as suffering great psychological harm.

The most important symptoms in this regard are hopelessness, worthlessness and self-blame, cognitive impairment, withdrawal and sleep dependence. Instead, frustration and anger have turned inwards against themselves, contributing to the risk of self-harm and suicide. While the group considers the level of risk with regard to mental health, it is clear that the current environment and circumstances are dominant contributors to their condition.

Where would they be sent? The answer is that they would be sent to Australia—unlike the Malaysian agreement which means that people transferred to Malaysia would not be resettled in Australia in the terms of the agreement. It breaks the people smugglers' business model in a way the previous government could never do.

We know that the member for Cook moved a motion in parliament last year supporting the so-called Nauru solution. We know that there were two members of the opposition who were paired from that vote, and they still lost that motion. They say that the parliament is sovereign. They still lost the motion on Nauru, but apparently that is a different standard. We saw the members for Pearce and

I have said this before and let me make it clear again to the House and the member for Cook: people transferred from Australia to Malaysia will not be illegal immigrants. There is a regime in place for Malaysia which deals with illegal immigrants, and it is fair to say it is a hard regime. But people transferred from Australia to Malaysia are not illegal immigrants; they are people transferred with the agreement of the Malaysian government.

He can make all the allegations he likes. They will not be caned. They will be treated with dignity and respect, and they will have protections in place. What we are doing is pulling the rug out from under the people smugglers' business model because—and I agree with the member for Cook and I think he agrees with me—people smugglers should not make the decision about who comes to this country. People who come to this country for resettlement should not have to risk their lives on a dangerous boat journey to come to Australia.

He was not able to touch on or answer how people who are sent to Malaysia will sustain themselves. He was not able to answer whether the children who are sent there will go to school. He was not able to answer any of the basic questions about the protection of their human rights. He came in and he gave his usual rant. He professed that he was not obsessed with the opposition spokesman for immigration, the member for Cook, and then proceeded for 15 minutes to talk exclusively about the member for Cook. There is probably a therapist he could call for that, but perhaps he would be best off concentrating on his portfolio and explaining to the Australian people what is going to happen if this Malaysia deal ever does come to pass.

On coming to office, they found themselves with a situation where the people-smuggling trade had been destroyed, there were four people within our detention network who had come here illegally by boat, and the administration of that detention network was costing the Australian public millions and not billions. But, within the space of four years, they have managed to push the people smugglers back into business, they have cost taxpayers literally billions of extra dollars, they have trashed any semblance of a coherent regional foreign policy and they are currently presiding over the essential collapse of our immigration detention network. Things have been so bad in border protection that

They sent up the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs. The fact that he was such a low-level emissary from the Australian government so offended the Papua New Guineans that they refused to make any progress on the arrangement, even though both sides of politics there were apparently well disposed towards it.

In a deal that highlights what savvy negotiators the Labor Party are, they have managed to get the Malaysians to take 800 of ours for 4,000 of theirs and we will get to pay the total cost. According to the Prime Minister and her hapless minister, this was a done deal with only minor details to be sorted out. It was announced on a Saturday eight weeks ago. Since that time, the immigration minister has been out there briefing journalists that it is about to be signed. They briefed journalists that the Malaysian Minister of

It was an incredibly silly thing to do because it completely undermined the very little leverage they had with the Malaysian government. They made a desperate negotiating position even worse. They had a position that was so weak they could only arrange a five-for-one people-swap. Then the government went further and they undermined any possible leverage that they could use through a panicked public announcement of these half-baked arrangements.

I have news for the minister and for Labor: they are the people smugglers' business model. If they want to destroy the people smugglers' business model, the best thing they could do is resign. People smuggling had been destroyed when they came to office, and they took a defibrillator and reinvigorated it—they zapped it back into life. The people-smuggling community are probably about the only ones left supporting this Prime Minister. The people smugglers have this government's measure. They understand that the Labor Party are all spin and no substance on tackling their evil trade. That is why, since this announcement was made eight weeks ago, they have actually sent more people illegally to Australia than arrived in the last six years of the Howard government. The people smugglers have seen how these guys opposite operate. They do not take them seriously, which is something they share with most of the Australian people.

After 15 minutes the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was completely and utterly unable to provide this House with even the most basic details of the ongoing negotiations with the Malaysians. What exactly has been going on for the past two months? Why has this minister been briefing journalists, saying that an agreement is imminent?

The government insists they are going to be transferred to a third country, but it cannot say if Malaysia is going to accept these people or if Malaysia will have the right of refusal over people who arrive here. It cannot say if Malaysia will accept people who arrive in Australia without documentation, which is a pretty important point considering that about 80 per cent of people who arrive here illegally do not have any documentation.

He is seriously telling people that he believes that is going to protect their human rights. The government has absolutely no idea what fate is going to befall the people it sends to Malaysia. It does not know how they will be fed or how they will sustain themselves. People there do not have work rights. Imagine if you were sent there and had a family—what would you do if you could not work? What would you be required to do to support them? You know that your children will not be educated. The government certainly cannot guarantee that people will not be subject to corporal punishment. These are legitimate questions, which the Australian people are right to ask, and the government should be providing answers to them.

I asked the Minister for Home Affairs exactly that series of questions last week in the House. His response was so vague as to be worthless. Quite frankly, he should just have stood up, shrugged his shoulders and stopped wasting everybody's time.

I had never been to Christmas Island and I found that it does take a considerable amount of time to get there. I went there as part of the Joint Select

While obviously I am limited in what I can discuss in reference to the deliberations of the committee in relation to those terrible events of 15 December, I can say that the trip was revealing to me in many respects and helped to form new approaches and perspectives on this issue.

During the course of the last two weeks I was prompted to respond to someone who felt strongly about the whole issue and—speaking candidly to the House—about the issue of Malaysia. I reflected on my experiences on Christmas Island and, in particular, talked about the visit we undertook to the place where those 30 people who had attempted to come to Australia perished on the rocks. I talked about the 20 people presumed dead and about the video that we had seen as part of the committee hearing. That video was taken from the perspective of the Royal

I talked about the responses the RAN personnel gave about the film of diesel that covered the water off Christmas Island that day, and about the fact that whenever a member of the RAN was trying to lift somebody out of the water and into the boat, the forearms of the people who were trapped would slip through the fingers of the RAN personnel because of the diesel that covered the ocean and those people.

Some of those first responders, including residents, said that they had thrown ropes to people in the ocean but that just as people were about to scramble over the top of the jagged rocks the swell would take them back out and then crash them back into the rocks. That would trigger a response from the people climbing up, who would let go of the rope and fall into the water. It was not just a case of those people coming back up over the rocks. As was put to us, any person who had a life jacket survived; anyone who did not have a life jacket did not survive. Forty-two people survived, 30 did not and 20 are missing, presumed dead. If you fell into the water without a life jacket, you were gone.

In some quarters there is a view that idealises people smugglers and tries in some respects to portray them as heroes. These people are profiting from the misery of others. They are profiting from misery and desperation. They do not adhere to the traditional view of people who are supposed to be in command of vessels—masters of vessels—that they should transport people only when they know full well that their vessel is safe and secure and that they can vouch for the welfare of the passengers on that vessel. They cannot do that. From my own perspective, I appreciate that there will be people that are moved by a concern that is, I would say, founded on an improper belief—that is, that sending people to Malaysia under this arrangement would put them in harm's way. We have heard what the minister has said—what clearly many of us regard as sacrosanct—which is that, with the benefit of guidance and input from the

Admittedly, the events of 15 December were highly unusual, as people told us on that day—in particular, some said that in living memory they could not recall the conditions being as bad as on that day. But no-one should be put in the position where they take that trip—two days across the ocean, 500 kilometres out from Jakarta, and take a risk that they will just land and they will find sanctuary—when in actual fact the people smugglers will not vouch for their safety. The people smugglers will not guarantee that safety and they are simply profiting from, as I said previously, the desperate plight of others. That is why I think it is important to place on the record that I do support the solution being advanced by the government. I believe it is a necessary one to deter people from making that decision to put their lives, the lives of their children and the lives of their loved ones in a terrible position where they risk all to come here.

They are denied the false and misguided belief that, if they hop on the boat, it is a quicker path here. We liberate and, for a group of people who believed they would not have hope, give hope for a second chance at establishing themselves in a new country and improving their lot. Those 4,000 refugees who will be admitted to our country, and the people I have spoken of warmly in this place who have set themselves up as model citizens, because they have been given the benefit of a second chance, will be able to benefit from the arrangements the government is putting forward.

But all I can say to them is that I wholeheartedly, and deep within me, believe that the solution we are putting forward is in the best interests of those who would contemplate making this trip and those who currently are stuck in another country, chiefly Malaysia, who seek a better life, who have sought refuge and who we can provide that refuge to.

If you review the history of when they sat on this side of the House, when they were urged to be transparent, when they were urged to correct their approach, the only time they took action was when people within their own government refused any longer to tolerate the litany of mistakes and errors and the fractured nature of the system as it was under the former government, and they tried to force change.

He indeed strikes me as a fine, upstanding moral citizen. I am a little worried that some of his strategies to achieve a given outcome are odd, perhaps even way out. But his intent of stopping people getting onto leaky boats at high monetary cost and at potentially the cost of their lives and the lives of their families is exactly the intention we have on this side of the House. The proof of our ability to achieve that, of course, is now recent history. When the Rudd government took over in this place there were four detainees in Australia—just four detainees. Years prior to that there was a great influx of illegal people-smuggling vessels. And we, through effective policy, stopped those boats arriving. Through the member's own admission, that is exactly what he wishes to achieve as an individual, he says. For goodness sake, why does he not say to his current leader, 'Simply put in place policies that will reverse those policies put in place in August 2008 and go back to a working system as introduced by the Howard government that stopped people declaring themselves as refugees, paying people smugglers to engage in their horrendous, often treacherous trade resulting in death at sea'? It is so simple.

Those policies—very simple, humane, effective and sympathetic policies—put an end to the flood of boats arriving on our shores with people seeking refugee status. These people had put their lives and the lives of their families at risk to get onto those boats. Families paid their hard-earned dollars to a people smuggler. It stopped. The member for Chifley ought to come across and join us, because our endeavours are exactly the same.

We believe they will have no more success than the policies that have been put in place since the Rudd government came to power. Of course, all those policies did was effectively to say to the potential arrivals on our shore that would pay people smugglers: 'Come on down; the gates are open. The welcoming committee is here for you.' No-one, no rational person in the government today, can stand up, hand on heart and say to the Australian people, 'We have policies that secure our borders and are effective in stopping the flood of illegal persons to these shores.' You cannot do it and therefore your credibility is shot—shot as in so many other areas. The Prime Minister herself, Ms

The Australian community feel it, all right.

What the Prime Minister in fact meant was: 'I will manage our borders in a way where I will conduct the traffic, I will regulate the traffic and I will direct the traffic. I will not slow the traffic. I will direct the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' dollars. I will do it in a way to increase the budget from $1 million to $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money per annum to look after refugees that come here through a process that risks their lives.'

Why on earth would somebody be on that side of the House as part of a government with failed policies when they express a point of view in this place that they sincerely desire a satisfactory outcome where people smuggling stops and people are not tempted to take to the sea in leaky boats? It is frankly beyond me.

More importantly, of course, we would like the cessation of the arrival of the boats. But we have asked today for you to explain why there is transparency lacking in your process, specifically in relation to the deal you are trying to cook up with Malaysia. That is a very interesting thing. I understand that the Malaysian proposition has been formulated on the basis that the easy approach to this problem—accommodating refugees and processing them in Nauru—was unacceptable to the Prime Minister because Nauru was not a signatory to the UN convention. It may be of interest to anyone that ever hears or reads my comments to find out that Malaysia is not a signatory to that convention either. Is it not interesting that Nauru was unacceptable, even though readily available and almost instantaneous, but Malaysia—in the same category of not agreeing with the UN convention—is acceptable? It beggars belief. I recall the member for Chifley mentioned something about our MPI surprising him. I suggest that it is beyond belief that the Prime Minister can find cooking a deal with Malaysia to be satisfactory, Malaysia not being a signatory, but doing an easy, instant deal with Nauru is not considered because they are not signatories. As a matter of interest, in regard to signing that convention, the Nauruan government has signed an instrument of accession to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, formally beginning the process of its ratification of the

If the past is any indication of the time it will take in the future, by the time the Prime Minister is in a position to actually announce a signed deal with Malaysia, I suggest that Nauru would possibly be a signatory.

Firstly, I want to point out how complex this problem is. Border protection is a very complicated issue. We know that we are a large continent. We know that our borders are quite significant. The member for Durack has a large electorate, and the previous one was an even larger electorate, and he would know how difficult it is cover a large area. In terms of border protection, Australia has to patrol an area equivalent to 11 per cent of the world's oceans. Australia does not have 11 per cent of the world's population, but we have to patrol 11 per cent of the world's oceans to make our borders safe—1.54 million square nautical miles.

Not only have members of the Border Protection Command appeared before the inquiry; they assisted the committee when we visited Christmas Island, where we met high-ranking officers as well as those doing the work on the ground and out on the ocean. They are all incredibly professional. I want to commend them for what they do, and I want to take issue with the suggestion in the MPI that somehow they are falling down. The reality is that, since the Gillard and Rudd governments have been in office, approx­imately one per cent of illegal vessels are arriving, whereas previously approximately 10 per cent arrived. We have gone up to 99 per cent protection, you could say. With the reality of patrolling 11 per cent of the world's oceans, we will never get it perfect. The radars in Hollywood movies just do not exist. The reality is that small, wooden boats are almost impossible to detect with radar from any great distances, even if the ocean is flat and calm. When there are hurricanes, cyclones and the like, it is even more difficult. Unfortunately, we saw that outcome with the boat tragedy.

Before we made the Malaysia announcement, there was a rush of people coming down here in all types of weather and we saw the tragedies that unfolded there. As I said, I commend Rear Admiral Tim Barrett and all the ADF personnel for what they are doing. Also, I read in the paper the other day about the endeavours of some other Australian agencies that operate beyond our borders that have had success in intercepting people before they pay the people smugglers and get onto boats and make those dangerous journeys. The efforts of those agencies are great to see.

Now up to 99 per cent of boats are being stopped, whereas previously it was about 10 per cent. The Gillard government invested $1.2 billion in the 2010-11 budget to bolster our border security. This is building on the $654 million border protection and anti-people-smuggling package announced in the previous budget. We have eight new Bay class patrol vessels. We met some of the Navy personnel working with those. We have 18 vessels and 17 aircraft, which operate out of

We saw that in Nauru, which was a total waste of money. We see that in the foreshadowed visit to Malaysia. Nauru never did break the people smugglers' business model. Where did 90 per cent of the people who ended up in Nauru finally put down their roots? They are either in Australia or New Zealand. There is something there that people smugglers can sell. Obviously we need to break that business model. As the member for Chifley stated—he is on the same inquiry—we should do so not only because it is good common sense for Australia but also, and more importantly, because it will save lives.

It does not have the same justice system as Australia. It has the same roots but it has evolved slightly differently. It has provinces that have sharia law. Malaysia is a country of contrasts; we know that. It has a proud history. Some say that, if the Macassans had had flags, maybe they would have claimed Australia when they came here in the 1500s and 1600s to trade with Aborigines. It has a proud history, but it is a country of contrasts. I would suggest that the

Then you can go to other provinces in Malaysia where there is strict, harsh sharia law embedded in the justice system. So Malaysia is a country of contrasts and it will be hard to protect every single person who goes there. I hope the member for Cook gets out of there safely; I am sure he will. The reality is that Malaysia does have a slightly different system to Australia, but I go back to the member for Chifley's point: if we can save lives with this exchange of 4,000 for 800 and also give those people who have been sitting patiently in the Malaysian refugee camps a chance to have a another life, that will be a good thing. When you weigh it up, if we can save lives and stop those horrific tragedies occurring again, that will be a good thing.

No doubt every day for the next 800 days will have the Leader of the Opposition coming in here and doing a stunt or going out in the media doing a stunt. Every day for the next 800 days he will trot something out. Maybe he will look to the past, especially today when we are looking at events of a year ago, but we will look at the future.

The then member for Bradfield, the opposition’s spokesperson on superannuation in 1992, described the Labor government policy as 'absolutely abhorrent'. He claimed that 'hundreds of thousands of workers are going to lose their jobs' and predicted the reforms 'would cause even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians'. The then member for O’Connor described superannuation as 'stupid and dishonest'. Senator Alston told the other place that 'imposing compulsory superan­nuation on individuals does not increase total savings'. The then member for Curtin said that 'the superannuation guarantee levy will have a disastrous impact on business'. I remind the House today of these 1992 statements to simply remind all of us how wrong it would be to let prejudice, vagrant opinion unsupported by visible facts, distract us from the important task of building domestic savings to support economic growth. It should be noted that the economic arguments advanced against the superann­uation guarantee in the early 1990s—whether it was that business could not afford it; that it would be better in workers’ pay; or that it will increase unemployment—were subsequently disproved and discredited. Yet these are exactly the same arguments being trotted out by the naysayers today.

Personal security is a priority—nine per cent superannuation is not enough to maintain the lifestyle most of us take for granted, especially women who have breaks in their career.

And the chance of one member of a couple reaching 100 is astonishingly high. So an increasing number of Australian retirees are going to outlive even substantial sums sets aside for retirement. Adequate retirement is even a bigger problem for women, given that women on average earn 34.8 per cent less than men.

By 2036, those numbers will lift to $485,000 for men and $345,000 for women, and members will note that this means women’s superannuation actually doubles between now and then. But a significant part of this forecast growth in retirement balances is attributed to the Gillard government’s proposed reforms of the minimum mand­atory 12 per cent superannuation guarantee and SuperStream’s efficiencies.

It will pay for the tax concessional treatment of the additional three per cent superannuation guarantee—because workers' retirement contributions are taxed at 15 per cent instead of their higher marginal personal income tax rate.

I am not satisfied the status quo of nine per cent will deliver a sufficient reward for decades in the workforce. For an individual it is around $23,000 a year including the aged pension entitlement. The average current retirement balance from AustralianSuper, I am advised, is about $43,000. If retirees try to live at the aforementioned adequacy standard their superannuation will be exhausted in just three or four years. If a couple stick to a modest lifestyle they have an 80 per cent chance of it lasting their lifetime as an allocated pension. For those who have bigger balances or those with more time in the workforce contributing nine per cent who may ultimately achieve balances of $150,000 or $300,000 the outlook is still not greatly better.

That is still well short of a retiree's life expectancy. Because the undeniable fact is that we are living longer. The number of Australians over 65 years of age is projected to grow from three million in 2010 to 8.1 million by 2050. During the same period, the ratio of working-age Australians to those aged over 65 will decrease from 50 people for every 10 today, to just 27 working people for every 10 by 2020.

Longer life is the great gift from 20th century Australia to 21st century Australia. The legacy of health and medical science discoveries combined with living in the lucky country. This longer life after work is why the Gillard government’s superannuation reforms are so very impor­tant to addressing the retirement savings adequacy gap that so many Australians are facing today.

This is a serious challenge to their financial independence. Currently, around 2.1 million Australian women get no tax benefit from contributing to superannuation, due to the 15 per cent superannuation contribution tax being at or below their income tax rate.

From 1 July 2012, the government will make the system fairer by ensuring no tax is paid on the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions for Australians earning up to $37,000 and that the money is instead directed into their superannuation. Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this policy are women. The superannuation savings of 2.1 million women earning less than $37,000 will be boosted by $550 million in 2012-13 alone. The combined impact of our reforms means the superannuation savings of 3½ million low-income earners, both men or women, will be boosted by a total of $830 million per annum in 2012-13. So a 30-year-old woman on average wages (around $60,000) will have an extra $108,000 in retirement savings, providing her with an extra $2,900 to spend each year of her retirement. If that 30-year-old women undertakes some part-time work and spends time out of the workforce, she will still have an extra $78,000 in retirement savings, amounting to an extra $1,800 to spend in each year of her retirement.

As of March 2011 Australia enjoys well over $1.36 trillion invested in superannuation. This figure is estimated to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2036, including $550 billion directly from the government's superannuation reforms which I have outlined. This massive, rapidly-growing pool of funds means that more money is available to be invested in the broader economy. A proportion of this growing pool of funds will be allocated to the domestic economy, and will continue to be a great enabler of Australian enterprise.

It should not be overlooked that during the global financial crisis approximately 15 per cent of the globe's capital raisings was undertaken here in Australia—largely due to our trillion-dollar nest egg.

I assure him that we are not. The coalition believes there is a pressing need to increase national savings. As a nation we need to save more to meet our burgeoning requirements for more infrastructure. We need to save more to provide for the longer retirements that we can all now expect to enjoy, as the Assistant Treasurer referred to. But we also need to save more to become less reliant on international capital markets.

The coalition wants to encourage as many Australians as possible to plan and save for their retirement and to take full advantage of the benefits the superannuation system offers. We want to see a superannuation system which is as efficient, as transparent and as competitive as possible so as to maximise retirement incomes for all superannuants.

In particular, sensible changes to streamline super fund operations and to strengthen corporate governance arrange­ments should be progressed by government as a matter of priority.

The very first step should be for the government to lead by example and get its fiscal house in order. This year the government is dissaving to the tune of $49.4 billion and next year—a heroic assumption, but nevertheless reported in the budget papers—$22.6 billion. Net debt will continue to rise and will peak at an estimated $107 billion next year, the highest peacetime debt in dollars in our history. This is a disturbing outcome at a time when Australia is enjoying the strongest terms of trade in around 150 years. Now is the time when the government should be putting money aside, paying down debt and preparing for a rainy day.

This is not because we do not believe in superannuation. Rather, many of the government's measures are funded from the proceeds of the mining tax. The coalition does not believe that saddling our most productive business sector with another tax is in the best interests of the country. It does not help our country to compete on a global scale by putting lead in the saddlebags of our fastest horse.

The government has committed to increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. What they have not been upfront about is who is going to pay. The additional superannuation which workers will accrue is not intended to be a wage rise. The total remuneration received by workers will not increase. Rather, the intention is that workers should accept lower wages growth in return for increased superannuation. Workers will have less spending power today in return for greater spending power in the future. Now is not the time to be eroding the growth in workers' take-home pay. Australians are already under considerable financial stress from the rising cost of living, rising interest rates and additional government taxes.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index shows consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. It is no wonder that Aust­ralians are cocooning—reducing spending and increasing savings. The household savings ratio for the March 2011 quarter rose to 11.5 per cent—again, a level not seen since the global financial crisis. The 11.5 per cent ratio means that households are now saving more than a tenth of their disposable income. Australians cannot afford another hit to their take-home pay.

These are, of course, Labor's forgotten families, already doing it tough and dealing with increasing cost-of-living pressures. There is Labor's flood tax and obviously the carbon tax, if it comes through this place, and they will probably be indirectly affected by the mining tax.

The government is creating a structural hole in the budget. The spending—that is, the tax forgone—from the increase in the superannuation guarantee will rise through time. However, the revenue from the mining tax is highly variable. The government's forecasts of revenue over the forward estimates are based on commodity prices and the terms of trade remaining at historically high levels. Inevitably, over the longer term, commodity prices will fall and revenues will decline. This combination of volatile revenues and rising commitments will add to the fragility of the budget. It will add to the cyclic movements in the budget bottom line. It is another example of the poor fiscal practice and inexperience of this government.

This would provide for all employees to receive superannuation guarantee contributions, no matter what their age. The coalition's current position is that it does not see it necessary to have any age limit at all. The current age limit set at 70 unfairly discriminates against older workers and, in effect, means they take a pay cut at age 70 through the loss of compulsory superannuation. At this point, some may be discouraged and leave the workforce. We should be encouraging mature Australians to work for as long as they want. We cannot afford to prematurely lose their hard won wisdom and skills.

However, what the Assistant Treasurer fails to mention is that this policy is simply unwinding in part the government's earlier decision in the 2009-10 budget to halve the contribution cap. That was ill-considered policy—in keeping with a number of other initiatives from the government. It was done at a time when many working Australians approaching retirement age had been dealt a hard blow by the global financial crisis. Their accumulated retirement savings had fallen sharply in value as stock markets crashed in Australia and around the world. What Australians needed was the capacity to rebuild their savings. Instead, this government chose to make it harder for them to contribute to superannuation.

These changes have, overall, been designed to raise additional revenue to pay for this government's wasteful ways. In effect, the government has been reducing the saving capacity of ordinary Australians so that it does not have to cut its own bloated spending. It is not good policy. The frequent changes have created great uncertainty and impacted confidence in the superannuation system as a retirement savings vehicle.

The Assistant Treasurer has noted a concession on the excess contributions tax, allowing people with first-time breaches of excess contributions up to $10,000 to be assessed at their marginal rate of tax rather than incurring a potentially higher rate of excess tax. This is welcome. Treasury estimates that more than 65,000 Australians are likely to breach their concessional superannuation contribution cap during the 2009-10 financial year, up from 28,000 the previous year. The government is taxing those excess contributions at 46.5 per cent and will collect around $140 million in additional tax revenue from these accidental breaches.

I have been advised that some superannuants who have unintentionally breached the non-concessional contribution cap rules by between just $125 and $5,000 each are now facing tax bills of around $70,000 each. This hardly seems equitable in the light of a government that has continuously shifted the goalposts for the past three financial years. It has made compliance and monitoring difficult if not impossible for working Australians, and all these hardworking Australians will not be assisted by the government's latest changes.

When last in government, the coalition introduced reforms to enable Australians to choose their own superannuation fund. We oversaw payments and incentives that encouraged Australians, especially Australians on lower to middle incomes, to make additional contributions to their retirement nest egg. The coalition will continue to support measures that encourage Australians to provide for their future.

The proposed amendment addresses this issue and ensures that minimum time frames are provided in the legislation. The ability to require a shor­ter time frame recognises that AUSTRAC and law enforcement will often require prompt responses so that they can effectively carry out investigations.

It also provides an opportunity for annual consultation with industry as to the most appropriate allocation of costs across the sector. The amendment to mandate a review of the regulatory impact of the levy will complement the two annual periods of consultation with industry that will have occurred as a result of the ministerial determinations in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 financial years. These stakeholder consultations, together with any changes made to the cost recovery model, will provide valuable input into the review of the supervisory cost recovery levy provisions contained within the bills.

The government has already publicly stated that invoices in respect of the AUSTRAC supervisory levy for the 2011-12 financial year would not be issued until at least February of next year. This time frame will provide AUSTRAC with an appropriate amount of time to establish its systems to collect the levy and also to engage with industry on practical aspects of its application. As such, the government supports this amendment, which clarifies in the bill statements already made on this issue.

AUSTRAC's superv­isory work goes towards protecting the integrity of the financial system and helping businesses remain resilient to money laundering. I commend the amendment to the House.

The opposition remains very ambivalent about this bill as a whole. Essentially we are adding a new layer of bureaucracy on business. It is an important layer of bureaucracy—I am not saying that we should not do it—but we are asking them to conform to this new bureaucracy and then coming to them and saying, 'You must also pay the bills for it.' I think that when you are providing a service directly to business that they require then it of course makes a lot of sense to recoup the cost to the taxpayer. But when you are asking business to just bear a bureaucratic burden on behalf of society—in this case, to combat the financing of terrorism and other illegal activities—then I think it begs the question about whether it is appropriate to get business to pay the bill for that. So we remain ambivalent about this bill, although we do believe that the acceptance of these two amendments makes it better than it was. In particular, the late payment amendment is due to start on 1 July, within a week, and it would have been quite insulting, I think, to run around and charge people late fees when the parliament is only just dealing with this about a week before the bill is supposed to commence. With these comments, the opposition does support the passage of the amended bill.

This bill was previously passed by this House, but this morning the Senate also passed the bill, along with government amendments. The bill in its amended form is now before the House for its consideration.

Schedule 4 contains an initiative that, when imple­mented, will streamline the process of compensation payers notifying Centrelink directly when payments are made by compensation payers and insurers. We have worked constructively through the issues raised by the insurance sector to make sure that this initiative can be implemented as intended. These amendments will allow for some outstanding issues to be finalised with the sector before the measure is reintroduced to the parliament. We remain committed to the initiative. Once implemented it will help ensure that people are paid their correct Centrelink entitlements and avoid debts and overpayments. I commend the bill to the House in its amended form.

That schedule would have had significant implications for the regulation of insurance and compensation payments and would have thrown Commonwealth law into direct conflict with the laws of the states and territories. Indeed, this was something which I raised in the debate when the bill was in the House previously, and the parliamentary secretary—I do not think the minister was present on that occasion—assured me that the amendments the government was then moving would address the issues that the insurance industry had in relation to the bill. It turns out that those amendments did not address those issues, and that has been disclosed in evidence before the Senate.

The submissions received during the Senate inquiry make it clear that schedule 4 would place a signifi­cant administrative and financial burden on insurance companies as well as on government agencies. It is also clear that a burden would also be borne by the wider business community, including small and medium businesses and non-government charity and not-for-profit groups. In their submission to the inquiry, for example, the Allianz company outlined the scope of notifications that would be required under the legislation. According to their subm­ission, some of the payments that would be required to be reported included past economic loss, future economic loss, gratuitous care, general damages, compen­sation for relatives, funeral expenses, and medical and related expenses. Were schedule 4 passed in its current form it would cause financial hardship to those recipients of injury compensation, including their families. Under the provisions of the bill it is not only individual Centrelink payments that would be affected but also those such as carer and family payments. As a result, the impact extends beyond any one person. Of particular concern to the coalition was the potential cost to industry if the legislation in its current form were to be enacted. According to one submission to the Senate inquiry, the cost would be tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, Allianz submitted:

So the coalition is pleased that the government has noted these concerns and has decided to split schedule 4 from the bill. We look forward to the way in which, I presume, the minister will look at these concerns that the insurance industry has raised, and we will look at the detail of any further proposal that comes before the parliament.

The government bill followed a consultation process, including an exposure draft in December 2010.

The member for Dunkley's bill only applies to the communication of price related information to a competitor, for the purpose of encouraging the competitor to vary their price, and where the communication has the effect of substantially lessening competition. This bill applies to the economy generally.

The first is where a firm privately communicates price related inform­ation to a competitor. This is described as a per se offence because the conduct of itself is so unredeeming that no further elements are required for liability. The second prohibition is where a firm generally communicates information relating to price, business strategy, or its capacity, and does so with the purpose of substantially lessening comp­etition.

I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report, including the member for Dunkley, who joined the committee as a supplementary member for the inquiry. I would also like to again place on record my thanks to the secretariat, who, under an increased workload, have again been of magnificent assistance in producing this report. Again I would like to place on record the need to make sure that these committees are adequately resourced. There is a different workload that we have in this parliament from the one before, and they are operating under very trying circumstances. That does need to be recognised; otherwise the work of these committees will not be able to go on.

The member for Dobell has described the process that gave rise to the two bills being before the committee and, with some enthusiasm, how the government and the committee sought to examine the private member's bill that I produced. If only that same vigour and enthusiasm, and period of examination and scrutiny, had been available to be applied to the government's bill—alas, it was not. It was an incredibly truncated and, I think, somewhat unsatisfactory process for looking at the government's bill.

It has a different recommendation, as you would imagine, from the government members' report. The government members' report recommends that the Treasurer's bill be adopted and the private member's bill I prepared be rejected. It is quite remarkable, though, that the body of the report shows that there was really very little independent evidence and considered justification presented to the committee, or relied upon in the committee's report, to enable it to arrive at an unequivocal recommendation such as has been outlined in the report by government members.

The regulatory impact statement exercise was characterised by some competition law experts as an exercise in self-justification. In my view, that was subsequently reinforced by the appearance of Treasury at our one-day hearing—a one-day hearing at a time when only my private member's bill was available. At that stage, when that hearing was being conducted, we had only an exposure draft of the government's bill. Even yesterday, we received from Treasury some answers that were not terribly illuminating.

But that complexity is exactly the reason why careful examination of these bills is justified. The bills need to be guided by sound economic policy and competition principles, as I think the coalition's bill was. We need to be mindful that price signalling can have both a positive and a negative effect on competition and on consumers or may have no effect at all. That needs to shape the way in which the law is crafted, and then that law needs to be embedded in known and understood Australian competition law concepts. You have to be careful not to overreach or to invite unintended consequences that might well be detrimental to the economic wellbeing of Australia and its citizens.

What worries me, though, is that we started at a point of shared purpose. There was a genuine shared purpose about the need to tackle anticompetitive price signalling. The government and the coalition then took divergent paths, and I am concerned to reflect that the process through which the committee operated has only made that divergent pathway even more divisive. I think it has produced defective legislation from the Treasurer. The government has not availed itself of the considerable technical expertise that was available to the committee through its submissions and has not had a genuine opportunity to examine the recom­mendations for amendments or even some conceptual changes that came forward in what were very high quality submissions. This has damaged the quality of the bill that the parliament will be asked to consider and in fact diminished the committee process. This is not a satisfactory way in which the committee should examine these bills of such moment.

Even though the committee recommendation is simply to pass the bill, I understand that the government will be bringing forward some amendments, in my view underlining the point that there is ample opportunity for improvement. All this remarkable truncated period and poor process has done is prove the point that this is too important an area of policy to have the government adopt a 'mine's bigger and tougher than yours' attitude, purely because the coalition's bill led the way in this area. This is not an area where the Treasurer should exercise what he thinks is his political heavyweight cred­entials while everyone looks at this outcome and thinks, 'This is economic policy lightweight work.' I think we can do better; I wish we had had the opportunity to do so and I hope the parliament carefully considers the report before it, including a shopping list of areas of deficiencies and flaws in the government's bill, which I fear the government will try and jackboot through this parliament after kicking to the kerb a process that could have offered so much more.

Because of the parliamentary placement program and our job as parliamentarians, we do know that those who don the green, the white or the blue are definitely a special breed of people. I note the member for Ryan, who is in the chamber tonight, has family who have done just that. For people who do don the green, the white or the blue, words like 'honour', 'courage' and 'service' are not words that are just trotted out in speeches on Anzac Day; they are not esoteric concepts. These are actually ways that they use to live their lives every single day.

The primary aim of the law of conflict, also known as international humanitarian law, is to protect the victims of armed conflict and to regulate the conduct of hostilities based on a balance between military necessity and humanity. At the heart of the law of armed conflict lies the principle of distinction between the armed forces who conduct the hostilities on our behalf, or on behalf of the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians, who are presumed not to directly participate in hostilities and must be protected against the dangers arising from military operations. Under these international humanitarian laws the concept of direct participation in hostilities, which refers to conduct which is carried out by civilians, suspends their protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Most notably, for the duration of their direct participation in hostilities, civilians may be directly attacked, unfortunately, as if they were combatants in those particular circumstances.

Although there has been a rise in diplomacy over the last 200 or so years, unfortunately we still have conflicts—not as much conflict in the last 20 or 30 years as in the horrific 40 years before, but nevertheless there are still trouble spots around the world. International humanitarian law developed within the limitations on the use of force in an attempt to minimise the horror, particularly in response to the conflict of

The doctrine of proportionality requires a response of force to be proportionate to the aggression that precipitated such force. This doctrine accepts wartime civilian casualties as unfortunately inevitable, but the doctrine of proportionality requires that civilian casualties inflicted by military strikes not be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage gained by the strike. The rules of engagement are specific to the conditions of a particular area of operations, and the actual text of any set of rules of engagement is classified and therefore not publicly available. For instance, if members or senators are overseas on a parliamentary placement program, unfort­unately, unless you have the right military classification, you are not able to see the rules of engagement. Soldiers often keep these on a card inside their jackets, because obviously it could be a problem if those they were fighting against knew the rules of engagement. We do not want the force we are up against to know what the ADF personnel can and cannot do. So the rules of engagement are always classified. Consequ­ently, I was quite surprised to see late last year much commentary in the media about the rules of engagement for our Australian soldiers in Afghanistan.

We ask much of our ADF personnel, but the High Court said that we cannot ask them to forgo access to justice. That is obviously a call that this House respects. That is why last year I was very shocked to hear an exchange between the shock jock Mr Alan Jones and the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony

Tony Abbott might wish to revisit this interview, because it was a particularly galling moment for many people—for many lawyers and for many people involved with the military justice system. I say this as the case against two of the Army reservists charged with manslaughter in Afghanistan will not go to a court martial after a judge advocate actually dismissed the charges. We should all be aware that this outcome was not because of the inappropriate musings of the Leader of the Opposition on the Alan Jones program. This was the result of the military justice system doing its job, and justice was done, as it will be done for the other soldier who is still experiencing the appropriate scrutiny of our Australian military justice system, and the legislation before the House supports that process. I commend the bill to the House.

However, as an outcome of the case of Lane v Morrison, it became necessary to change the legislative framework for the court. This occurred back in 2009. At the time, the Minister for Defence said that establishing a correctly constituted military court was of the highest priority for the government. However, two years on, we are no closer to seeing this statement become a reality.

And this is why we are here today, moving an amendment to effectively allow an extension of the time line for the government to implement legislation for which they had set their own timing—legislation they once stated was of the highest priority. If it takes two years to get to formulation stage of legislation for an issue of highest priority, it raises serious questions as to the capacity of this government. This failure to meet their own standards is yet another example of a broken Labor promise, of letting down the very people they should be supporting. We have seen it with home insulation, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch, the cash-for-clunkers scheme and the green loans program. I am concerned that when an issue is labelled 'high priority' by this government those words may very well be its kiss of death. Who could forget the former Prime Minister's words that an

We now have no ETS legislation and just another tax to deal with the problem. Of course, it is important that the legislation to establish the court be properly and effectively drafted, but surely the minister could explain to the House why it is that we have this delay.

We must support our troops. They must know what is in store for them, and what avenues they have—we cannot continue to leave them in limbo. The uncertainty surrounding this legislation and the uncertainty surrounding an area that affects our servicemen's and servicewomen's lives do not provide them the support that they deserve. This amendment does allow the existing interim arrangements to continue, but the point is that both the government and the coalition acknowledge the need for change. Equally, our servicemen and servicewomen would be well served by the Australian Military Court. This was established after a series of Senate committee reports over a number of years that recommended extensive changes to the military justice system. Those who handle military discipline require a critical understanding of the nature of service—in fact, there are offences, such as going absent without leave, that apply only in a military sense. It is particularly important that the

It is sensitive, can be emotional and is difficult for non-military personnel to understand, but it is vitally important to provide certainty and stability to those who serve our country. More than just putting out press releases stating an intention to re-establish the court, as we saw last year, the government must now actually make this happen, genuinely make writing the full legislation for an Australian military court their highest priority. For once this government must actually match the words 'highest priority' with real action, not more excuses for their failure.

So I make those comments by way of providing a context for where we find ourselves: inheriting a system that has been struck down as constitutionally invalid, and so we have had to go back and validate the previous system so that actions taken whilst the Australian Military Court set up will be legalised.

It is to provide tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates. It was some time back when I looked at the explanatory memorandum and other documents and there was another trigger. It was up to two years or subject to a determination, whichever one came first. In the material I now have I see it is for two years or until the Minister for Defence declares, by legislative instrument, a specified day to be a termination day, which is sooner. The appointments are due to expire in September this year; hence we need this bill. I understand that the redrafting of the bill for the Australian Military Court is very close and what this bill also does is make sure that the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocates continue. I also understand that when the AMC legislation comes before us we will have a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. That is a good thing because that is what is needed. There is a lot that could be said about this, but I have spoken on this matter once before in this place and outlined my thinking on it and there is no need for me to go through that again. It is really clear that we do need certainty. Once we have the Australian Military Court justice system in place it will be a good thing for all as well as for our soldiers who serve and operate under it. It applies not only in a theatre of war or in a conflict but in a whole range of areas of their service life, and they need to have that certainty. There are a whole lot of things that happen in terms of discipline and disciplinary actions within the Australian defence forces, and a lot of that will continue as well. It was deemed necessary by the defence forces—

Importantly, it refers to the commencement day of the application provisions as being the day that the No. 1 act commenced, which was 22 September 2009.

Also, clause 2 of schedule 3 deems a person who held office as a chief military judge immediately before the decision in Lane v Morrison to be the Chief Judge Advocate. It is a bill that provides certainty in case it is needed for the tenure and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate until we have the final bill before the House. I commend the bill to the House.

It has in the meantime put in place interim arrangements to ensure that our military justice system continues. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 has been introduced to sustain the military justice system. The Military Justice (Interim Measures Amendment) Bill 2011 has been developed to continue these appointments, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the two full-time judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the Australian Defence Force. This legislation will establish a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. Unfortunately, when the coalition set up the Australian Military Court without implementing legisl­ation that aligns with chapter III of the Constitution, it resulted in a ruling in a case in 2009 that the court was unconstitutional. The Labor government has since introduced legislation to establish a fully independent court, the Military Court of Australia.

The Gillard Labor government is continuing to keep Australia safe and to strengthen our military and Defence Force systems, in turn countering threats at home and keeping our defence and security forces strong. There can be no greater responsibility for government than the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. The Labor government has ended the decade-long gap in strategic analysis and defence reform to create a smarter, stronger and more adaptable system and an organisation that can defend Australia, our people and our interests. This bill is further proof of the commitment to the ongoing reforms.

A couple of weeks ago at the Puckapunyal Army barracks I attended the dedication of the Australian Defence Force's Puckapunyal memorial chapel. The chapel was completed on 31 January this year and provides a nondenominational facility cond­ucting services and community activities for the soldiers and families within the Puckapunyal community. Sadly, however, it has been used as the venue for a number of memorial services for fallen soldiers. It is an important part of the Tobruk Barracks in Puckapunyal.

Our Puckapunyal units play a big role in enhancing Australia's Army capability. The Puckapunyal Military Area is one of the largest training areas for soldiers in Australia and it is a world-class facility that plays a vital role in preparing soldiers for combat, including our troops in Afghanistan. It covers some 44,000 hectares of undulating box ironbark forest and grassland and is one of the Defence Force's most heavily used training facilities. It has had new facilities built and others upgraded.

We were given the opportunity to tour and inspect the latest equipment to be used by Australian troops in battle that is put to the test at these new facilities. It is all about making sure that our troops have the right equipment to do their job. As we all know, our troops rely on this equipment in battle. The equipment needs to be battle ready and safe, which is why it is crucial that we test it thoroughly before we put it in their hands.

Equipment is subjected here to the same kinds of conditions our troops face on operations, including rugged terrain, extreme weather and night operations.

It is critically important for the men and women of the ADF that they have access to an effective military justice system. An efficient and fair military justice system is a key foundation for the excellent service discipline that places the ADF amongst the world's best militaries. While we move to a permanent solution for the military justice system that is in line with chapter III of the Constitution, I support this bill and wish it a speedy passage.

Parliament then enacted the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009, which reinstated the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. The reinstate­ment of the pre-2007 military justice system was required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system which would meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution.

We cannot guarantee that necessary legislation will be enacted before September this year. As a consequence, this bill seeks to continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates for a further two-year period or until such time as the Minister for Defence declares, by legislative instrument, a specified day to be a termination day, whichever first occurs.

Customs plays an integral role in stopping the importation of illicit goods smuggled into the country by organised criminal syndicates through our ports and airports. In the latest budget, Customs revealed that the number of reported consignments of air and sea cargo has gone up significantly and that that number is forecast to go up even further over the next four years. Despite this, Labor have not increased the amount of air and sea cargo that is inspected or examined, which means even less cargo will be properly checked under their new, pared down regime.

Labor's cut resulted in a reduction of 75 per cent in air cargo inspections—that is, 75 per cent less air cargo is being inspected when it comes into the country. In the recent Customs annual report, it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. Even less cargo will be inspected and examined now that there is an increase in the volume of cargo coming into the country. So we have a significant increase in the volume of cargo coming in through both our seaports and airports, yet the government is continually slashing funding—the end result being that so much less of that cargo is actually being examined for contraband, whether that be precursors for drugs, drugs themselves, illegal weapons or other things we would like to keep out of the country. Clearly the government is not doing all it can to combat organised crime when it has been so lax and so disastrous for our border protection regime in so many ways.

These diversions from the core crime-fighting tasks, caused by Labor's mismanagement of our borders, only serve to give organised crime a helping hand. Working together with appropriate resources, the Australian Federal Police, Customs and the Australian Crime Commission would have been the weapon of choice against serious and organised crime in Australia. Labor's budget cuts in this area are a slap in the face for our law enforcement agencies and the Australian public, who these agencies are tasked to protect. The coalition believes our key law enforcement agencies need to be appropriately resourced in order to stop organised criminals from growing their business.

The act provides a scheme to trace, restrain and confiscate the proceeds of crime against Commonwealth law. The act allows in some circumstances for it to be used to confiscate the proceeds of crime against foreign law or the proceeds of crime against state law. The act also permits confiscated funds to be given back to the Australian community in an effort to prevent and reduce the harmful effects of crime in Australia. The act was the result of a review which found that the inclusion of civil forfeiture at the federal level would vastly extend the capacity to recover funds from breaches of federal law. The coalition supports the strategy of being able to confiscate assets and profits which are the result of crimes committed overseas.

Part VI of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 enables an Australian court to register and enforce orders raised by a foreign court. These foreign orders comprise restraining, confiscation and pecuniary penalty orders over property derived from serious criminal offences. Once a foreign order is registered in Australia it is able to be enforced as though it were an Australian order made under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Provisions in the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1985 expand upon the regime in the Mutual Assistance Act and allow an Australian court to register and impose forfeiture orders issued by the International Criminal Court and designated international war crimes tribunals.

The court had no discretion whether to hear from a person affected by the order and there was no statutory provision available which allowed the person affected to challenge the making of the order. In particular, the decision reinforced that courts must be authorised to exercise control over the making or enforcement of proceeds of crime orders.

This bill will make minor but important amendments to the Mutual Assistance Act, the International Criminal Court Act and the International War Crimes Tribunals Act. The amendments will allow a court greater discretion when deciding whether a foreign order should be registered and enforced in Australia and whether or not to hear an application for registration on an ex parte basis. The amended provisions will necessitate a court to register a foreign order unless it considers that it would be contrary to the interests of justice do so. In deciding whether registration of a foreign order is in the interests of justice, the court is to give due regard to the primary intention of the system.

The purpose of this subdivision is to allow Australia to give effect to foreign orders in circumstances where a property related to serious foreign offences is located within Australia. The amendments aim to bolster reciprocity as the basis of international crime cooperation. It aims to ensure Australia is able to provide the same level of assistance to other countries as we would expect from them.

This issue has been raised in the Senate by my colleague Senator Brandis, and he and I, and I suspect all of the opposition, would urge the government to undertake appropriate action to ensure that Mr Hicks does not make a substantial financial gain specifically out of the crimes that he himself has admitted that he committed. This is somebody who has admitted that he consorted with Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is a diabolically bad terrorist group responsible for killing literally hundreds of people, and killing two Aust­ralians. Now this man is going to perhaps earn up to $350,000, by some conservative estimates, based on those crimes—crimes which, I again remind the House, he has pleaded guilty to.

As far as the opposition is concerned, it should be very straight­forward—Mr Hicks has admitted his crimes and he should not be able to profit from them. I asked the Attorney questions about this in the House last week, and all he would say was that he has commenced an investigation into the applicability of the legislation to Mr Hicks's publication that details his support of and participation in a terrorist organisation.

It is symptomatic of this government that they would sit on their hands and not take more sensible action against Mr Hicks in what is clearly an open and shut case of somebody standing to profit very significantly from his crime. In the case of Mr Hicks, of course, the crimes for which he has pleaded guilty are incredibly serious. Indeed, it is very difficult to believe that there are many crimes worse than consorting with terrorists, particularly really vicious terrorists such as Lashkar-e-Taiba. So I urge the government to finally take some action on this matter and not let it stand that any Australian citizen could profit from their criminal activity.

We always support measures that ensure Australia is not seen as a safe haven for criminals and that limit the ability of criminals to profit from their crimes. I commend the bill to the House.

I have often spoken in the House about how crime knows no boundaries. When we have discussions about police and law and order is a folly for us to talk about state or territory policing, because the truth is that none of the criminals out there read the Constitution or look at the geography when they seek to participate in criminal endeavours. They look for loopholes and opportunities, and the same applies when we are looking at international crime.

I am often attracted to comments about how we have to look at criminal activity as a business. It is no doubt a nefarious business, but it is still a business with a profit motive and we need to do all we can to put those businesses out of business. This bill goes to the heart of that.

Not all that long ago I had the opportunity as part of a parliamentary delegation to visit a number of countries to discuss the contemporary efforts being deployed against serious and organised crime by leading law enforcement agencies. I was looking at one of the reports we wrote where we quoted from the head of the Italian national police, Mr Rafael Grassi. He highlighted to our committee the importance of going after the money and depriving criminal groups of their assets. As a member of the Italian national police, he was very much at the forefront in the fight against the Mafia. He indicated to us that Mafia members are prepared to spend time in prison and conduct further criminal activity outside prison, but what really harms them is going after their assets. Essentially, that is what we are trying to do through this legislation. We are trying to make it more conspicuous and to make it easier for the Australian courts to assist in the process.

If criminal assets are being invested in Australian businesses it is detrimental to this country. Every individual has the right to have their property protected. It is the responsibility of our government to ensure that our police have the resources they need and the legislative support they require to do their jobs and achieve the objective of putting criminals out of business. This bill indicates that we will not tolerate criminal activity and we will use every opportunity to make it more onerous to pursue criminal endeavours, even if they are investing those moneys abroad.

A foreign proceeds of crime order is an order that restrains or confiscates the proceeds or instruments of a foreign offence, or orders a person to pay a certain amount equivalent to the benefits they have derived from a criminal activity, as determined by a foreign jurisdiction.

Firstly, it deprives the criminal of the benefits of their crime—the profits of their business, if I can put it that way. In doing so, it reduces the motivation for engaging in a criminal endeavour, because they know at some stage they may have all of their so-called hard-earned cash taken away from them. So the objective is to reduce the motivation for engaging in criminal activity by essentially attacking the business model underpinning criminal endeavours. The second and no less important aspect is that it removes assets that would ordinarily be available to be reinvested into other criminal endeavours. That is also significantly attractive and a laudable objective.

Whilst Afghanistan has the vast majority of the world opiate trade—somewhere about 97 per cent, I think—we know that it is finding its way to not just the criminals who underpin that trade, Colombians and others; it is also supporting terrorism. There is a clear link in respect of that, as

We need to be far more proactive than that. We are not going to be silenced on receiving foreign benefits from crime and using this country as a safe haven so it can be reinvested or simply transferred back to other criminal organisations. Australia must be on the front foot doing what it should be doing as part of its obligations in the international law enforcement community and doing everything possible to shut down serious and organised crime.

This legislation is not just another technical amendment proceeding through this place; this is something that has very serious ramifications. Like all aspects of business, crime is constantly changing. We need to ensure that our laws meet the challenge of criminal enterprises thinking it is a feasible objective to operate in this country, whether directly in criminal activity or by investing their proceeds of crime in this country.

In this case, the High Court found a New South Wales scheme that required a judge to determine and hear an ex parte application for a restraining order which was unconstitutional. That is why we need to act to bring in these supportive amendments. This case in New South Wales highlighted the fundamental importance of ensuring that the functions and powers imposed on our judges by legislation do not conflict with the integrity of the functions provided for under chapter III of the Constitution. Under the current structure, the courts have no discretion as to whether to hear from a person affected by an order. There is also no statutory provision available to allow for the person affected by the order to have the challenge reviewed. This amendment ensures that the general framework of providing assistance to foreign countries, international tribunals and international criminal courts in registering proceeds of crime orders issued by them continues to operate as intended in this country.

By articulating the overarching purpose of subdivision A, this amendment also provides assistance to judicial authorities in their interpretation of these provisions, which provide a comprehensive scheme for facilitating international cooperation in the registration and enforcement of foreign orders in Australia. As it stands, without this amendment there is a standstill in the processing of many criminal cases which involve property to the value of many hundreds of millions of dollars in this country. One such example involves the United Kingdom authorities. Despite their request for the registration of orders from the proceeds of pension fraud and share fraud to the value of tens of millions of dollars, under the current legislation and the decision of the High Court, Australia has not yet been able to proceed on these requests. Without the passage of this bill, there will likely be further delays in the registering of foreign orders. As a result of this loophole in our system there is already a risk that these assets will be moved offshore. They will be moved offshore as proceeds of crime to reward those who undertake criminal endeavours and, more importantly, will be available to be reinvested in future criminal activity.

This amendment bill makes it abundantly clear that no criminal act will be tolerated and that law enforcement is not limited to the bounds of any one nation. It lets the criminals know that Australia unequivocally supports the foreign courts when it comes to confiscation, restraining and pecuniary orders of stolen assets. I am very proud to support this amendment bill and I commend it to the House.

If left unchecked it can rapidly undermine the rule of law and break down societies. You do not have to look too far to see troubling examples around the world.

People smuggling is of course classified as organised crime, and the coalition has spoken about this on many occasions before. Stopping the people-smuggling business is a major priority for the coalition. We stopped the boats before and have the record to prove it. Yet the Labor government takes a different approach—boat after boat, policy mess after policy mess. The Minister for Justice in his second reading speech stated:

The reason that our borders have become increasingly permeable is this government's failed policies. Opening the doors to the people smugglers has led to an inhumane situation where people are risking their lives to come to Australia. Why doesn't this government go back to the policies of the coalition, the policies of the Howard government, which stopped the boats? Why doesn't the Prime Minister pick up the phone to the

The people of my electorate of Swan are rightly concerned at the collapse of our border security and the numerous lives that have been lost at sea under laws that this government has set in its approach to people smuggling. The government stands condemned by both houses of parliament for its ineffective people swap deal with Malaysia.

Clandestine laboratories, or 'clan labs', are used for the manufacture of illicit drugs, in the majority of cases the dangerous methylamphetamine. They can be particularly dangerous facilities and are often run in residential areas. The Australian Crime Commission reports that more and more clandestine labs are being detected across the country, but the largest shift in detection numbers has occurred in Western Australia, from 30 labs in 2007-08 to 78 in 2008-09—a reported increase of 160 per cent.

One of the dangers of drug labs is explosions and fires caused by highly reactive chemicals, and that is why it is so important that they are eliminated from our suburbs. Just a few days ago there was another high-profile incident where the man arrested over the death of a grandfather in a road accident in Gosnells was discovered to be operating a drug lab. One of my constituents reported a suspected clandestine drug lab to me at one of my recent mobile offices. I subsequently reported this to the police and the Minister for Police, and the premises were raided a few days later.

Confiscating the proceeds of crime is important. It is also a means of achieving some compensation for the community. A great example of this is the funding round run by the Liberal-National state government on the proceeds of crime.

In fact, considering that the socialist tendencies of our Prime Minister and her willing submission to the Greens Trotskyite agenda are matters of public record, it is hardly surprising that an increasing number of people are reaching this conclusion.

Who or what controls our precious land resources is a matter of national sovereignty and one that this government has blatantly ignored. The failure of this government to generate a comprehensive response to the avalanche of foreign ownership requests to acquire vast slices of our agricultural sector is a national disgrace.

The member spoke about concern in international circles that a global food shortage was on the horizon. Exacerbating this concern is the predicted explosion in global population from the current 6.9 billion people to nine billion by 2050. It is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the

If there was a coordinated and reasoned approach to the current rules regarding foreign investment approvals, I would not be so concerned. But the government is simply not standing up for our national interests.

We have honey bees exposed to foreign diseases and the apple industry preparing for the worst as apples with fire blight are given the green light to enter Australian borders. Each and every time this government has been faced with making the tough decisions in agriculture, it has taken the easy option or no option at all.

The draft legislation that was released two weeks ago was the modified tax that Twiggy had insisted Australia should have. On 29 June last year Twiggy outlined the issues that had been negotiated with the government about the tax. Concerns were raised about the 'retrospective nature of the tax by doubling the value of spent capital', 'an immediate write-off for new capital' and 'full transferability of super mining tax liability across projects'. All of these concerns were addressed by the government and are now in the draft legislation. So Twiggy comes here on his private jet to modify a tax that met his concerns. As the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy, the very capable member for Batman, made clear last week, this is beyond the pale. What is worse is that Twiggy has, according to Laura Tingle, never signed a corporate income tax cheque for any of the listed companies he has run. On

Twiggy and the coalition say the money raised from Premier Barnett's iron royalties will fund hospitals and nurses. The stench of partisan politics is all over Mr Twiggy Forrest. What does he think the money raised by this federal government through the minerals resource tax will do?

Those opposite do not have a leg to stand on. If they accept that the people of Western Australia have a right to iron ore royalties then how can they deny that the Australian people have a right to those royalties too? Those opposite claim this is to be part of another 'big new tax' but if they can accept that the Liberal Premier of Western Australia can place a big new tax on mining companies, how can they deny the government's scheme? Liberal tax: good. Labor tax: bad. What hypocrisy!

I am sure that Mr Forrest is an honourable person and pays his personal income tax, but none of his companies have ever paid company tax to the Australian people. Yet he comes over here and complains that this is going to be inflicted upon him, a poor Aussie battler.

It is not that one tax in Western Australia is good and a tax here in Canberra is bad. It is the same standard for all—they are either all good or all bad, all justified or not justified. I really think that the responsible comments of Mr Poli are much more reasonable than those of Mr Forrest.

He gave a tremendous valedictory speech last night. I thought it summed up the man and his service to our party. He has indicated that he will continue his involvement in the South Australian Liberal Party in years to come, particularly in the regional areas where he has done so much fine work over such a long period of time.

I have previously made comments in relation to former Prime Minister Howard and former Treasurer Costello, acknowledging their service, and it is only just that I also do so for Senator Minchin, who was an extremely important part of one of Australia's best governments.

He continues to be someone who stands by his convictions, and there is no greater virtue in public life than in being someone who stands by their convictions, whether they are popular or unpopular. Many of the issues that Senator Minchin has pursued in his long career have not been what you would describe as popular views. He stands proudly by his views, which is compelling about Nick and the way in which he has gone about his career.

I think Nick could have gone on and I wish he had gone on. I am personally very disappointed that I will not get to serve longer in this place with Senator Minchin. He started his career in the Liberal Party here in Canberra in 1977. I think he mentioned June 1977 last night, which coincidentally is the month and year of my birth. That gives an indication of the longstanding commitment Nick has given our party and this place.

He was also an enormous part of the intellectual fabric of our party in 1996 when we came back to government. He was very closely associated with the leadership of the former member for Mayo, which was an interesting time in Australian politics and a period that I am sure helped develop Senator Minchin's political antenna. His has one of the great political antennas in this country.

I am not a monarchist and I do not necessarily share his sympathy for the car industry. But those of us who might describe themselves as free trading, tax-cutting federalists have no greater inspiration.

He has contributed enormously to this party. He has contributed in ways that many people would never understand. I personally owe him a debt of gratitude for the advice he has offered me over a substantial period of time. I have not always agreed and I will not always agree with Nick's views but on many I do, particularly those outlined by Senator Ryan. I pay tribute to Nick and his five colleagues who are entering retirement by choice or by force.

It described what it called a 'new order' to replace what it called the 'welfare model of disability services' with a 'three-pillar policy': a comprehensive National Disability Insurance Scheme to deliver lifetime care and support for people with severe and profound disability, a strong income support system to enable people who cannot support themselves through work to live in dignity, and a range of measures to facilitate increased private expenditure.

As we can see around the world and at home, the main issue surrounding disability services is this issue of social inclusion. I do believe it is now time to embrace an NDIS in this country and also to look to providing more support for people in less-developed countries in our near region who have a disability.

The group also wants to see a permanent paediatric surgeon at the hospital, as the current surgeon is restricted to a limited roster. I support this aspiration in principle; however, I am very aware of the debt the former Labor government has lumbered the people of New South Wales with. My coalition colleagues in New South Wales are doing all they can to get New South Wales back on track. It is certainly a goal that the foundation should continue to work towards.

It pledges approximately $250,000 per year to purchase paediatric medical equipment for Campbelltown and Camden hospitals. This contribution is in addition to the support it offers local community health centres, research projects and children's community health programs such as asthma awareness and juvenile diabetes monitoring. The foundation's success relies on the kindness of the residents and businesses in my electorate who continue to support its events and fundraisers. The generosity of people living in Macarthur is something I have always been very proud of. I am continually amazed, but not surprised, by their willingness to dig deep in order to help local families who are doing it tough.

Eleven years later, it now raises enough funds to donate around $1 million every four years to purchase paediatric medical equipment for our local hospitals.

The annual ball raises funds with a silent auction and major raffle, and guests could pledge money to purchase hospital equipment. This year the ball raised $130,000, a great achievement that the foundation, its volunteers and members of my community should be very proud of. A total of 470 guests attended this gala event, including local residents, business owners, politicians, local councillors and parents who have benefited from the support of the foundation.

Harrison lives with a disability called quadriplegic cerebral palsy, and his family has received support from the foundation. Harrison's parents, Lynette and Justin, have described him as a little boy who loves life and the

Most weekends you can find him at a football game or sitting in front of the TV watching his team and cheering them on. He may not be able to say the whole alphabet yet, but Harrison can proudly tell you every Wests Tigers player's name. Lynette and Justin said Harrison's disability prevents him from walking around unaided. Thanks to the foundation, he now has the use of a walking frame, which his parents say has changed their lives completely. Harrison can now enjoy getting out and about with his parents, because he can walk using his frame with minimal assistance.

Thanks to the foundation, children in Macarthur who need this equipment can borrow it from an equipment loan pool to save their parents the expense of purchasing expensive equipment that they grow out of so quickly.

It is for this reason that I wanted to acknowledge the foundation and its achievements today. The Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation is a great asset to my community and has given support, hope and strength to many families in my electorate. I would like to publicly congratulate the foundation on its achievements and thank the residents in my electorate who continue to support it. Everyone involved is making this world a better place for our children, and that is something I believe we should all aspire to.

Anne was diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 55. Since then she has worked tirelessly and passionately to promote awareness of Parkinson's in the broader community and to help those battling the disease. In particular, she has discovered and passed on to others the remarkable remedial benefits that artistic expression—in particular, painting—has had on her condition.

Anne believes you can fight to have a life with Parkinson's disease, so she founded Painting with Parkinson's in Victoria, which includes coordinating a group of members who suffer from Parkinson's disease—affectionately termed by Anne as 'fellow parkies'. Through her leadership of the group, Anne helps others experience the transformation that occurred with her own life, passing on this unique painting therapy which has had a profound effect on sufferers' confidence, creativity and wellbeing.

Anne has established Painting with Parkinson's classes in Portland, Shepparton and Melton. As an ambassador for Parkinson's Victoria, she travels to all three locations regularly to provide support and encouragement and also to carry out a study for Parkinson's Victoria on behalf of this particular group. Anne has organised art exhibitions where the wider community is invited to view the artwork and learn about Parkinson's, often dispelling common myths and stereotypes in the process.

Anne said she wrote the book because she would have liked to read something like it when she was in the early days of her diagnosis—something that was not too heavy and not too light but, as the ad goes, just right. This book is really illuminating. It is divided into sections on the symptoms of Parkinson's and how to deal with those symptoms. It is an incredible book. It is written by someone with extraordinary courage. I will have the great honour of launching it this Saturday. For those people who can buy this book to learn more about Parkinson's, please do. It is an incredible tribute to an absolutely incredible woman.

In fact it is increasingly clear that telecommunications competition is being strangled because this government is determined to push ahead with a shiny new network and ranks that as a higher priority than a competitive market in telecommunications. Despite the rhetoric, for at least the next decade Telstra's will be the only network connected to a very large number of homes in Australia. Over that time the government plans that the number of homes served by the

And it is already running well behind the timetable. The NBN Co. corporate plan said there would be around 1.27 million homes passed by fibre by 2013, but they are running well behind schedule, with less than 1,000 services in place right now.

But, unfort­unately, it is clear from the terms of this draft document that the Gillard government is giving Telstra a very soft ride indeed. The government's stated objective is to impose upon Telstra a requirement that 'industry is able to access Telstra's copper network on a transparent and equivalent basis' during the transition period. In simple terms, what equivalence should mean is that a vertically integrated company like Telstra sells services to its retail competitors on the same basis as it sells those services to its own retail business. But the draft ministerial direction does not even contain a clear statement of what 'equivalence' is.

For example, since 2005 Telstra has been required to have a position with the Orwellian title of 'director of equivalence'. But Telstra gives every indication of having specified to the holder of that role that his or her key performance indicator is to do absolutely nothing.

Similarly, the draft direction fails to contain any of the requirements of Telstra that you would typically expect in this situation. There is no requirement that Telstra specify its transfer pricing arrangements and publish transfer pricing lists. There is no requirement for internal contracts setting out non-price terms of supply. There is no requirement for stronger ring-fencing of staff and no prohibition on cross-divisional responsi­bilities. And there is no requirement that compliance and disputes with the arrangements be overseen by an independent body.

Telstra and, it is now reported, Optus will be paid to shut down their networks and transfer customers across to the NBN—an arrangement between competitors that would be illegal under trade practices law were it not for the Gillard government changing the law to permit it. Further, specific legal barriers have been imposed upon any player proposing to enter the market in competition with NBN, including being required to comply with NBN Co.'s technical standards and prices.

The question is whether the Gillard government will respond to the submissions of the competitive side of the industry and materially toughen up the arrangements which apply during the interim period in which the majority of Australians will still be getting their services from Telstra or over the Telstra network. If the Gillard government does not materially toughen up these arrangements for the interim period, it will be very bad news indeed for competition and for the large majority of Australian telecommunications consumers who will still be using Telstra's network.

The editorial missed the mark on a number of points, most of them easily corrected in a letter to the editor. What I want to talk about tonight, though, is the editorial resorting to a cheap shot at Australia's foreign aid program.

Most of us received a chain email doing the rounds during the floods making false claims about the government's flood relief response and calling for cuts to Australia's aid budget. On this side of the House we were disgusted but not all that surprised when the proposal was adopted as coalition policy by the opposition leader. The opposition leader took the One Nation bait and advocated cutting funding to Indonesian schools, funding that was introduced by the Howard government and that is widely praised for its role in combating terrorism by giving Indonesian children an alternative to the radical Islamic schools by instead providing them with a mainstream education. I do not know whether the editorial writer, like the opposition leader before him, was inspired by that email, but his comments certainly used the same populist language and could only have been designed to stir up a mean and insular attitude to foreign aid. Regardless of the editorial writer's motiv­ations, I want to put on record my objection to such low rent button pushing and my strong support for the government's commitment to fighting poverty and building security through our overseas development program.

Those goals call on developed countries like ours to lift our overseas aid with the aim, by 2015, of halving world poverty and tackling related issues of child and maternal mortality, lack of education and the rates of infectious disease. The task is enormous. There are one billion people today living in extreme poverty. Eight million children every year—that is, 24,000 a day—die before their fifth birthday. These are shocking and over­whelming facts. The question is: what should we do in the face of such hardship? Australians cannot opt out of the global community. For better or worse this is our world. Should we wait for someone else to come along and fix these problems? If so, who might that be? Are we waiting for a better time to address these injustices? If so, when might that be? The truth is that these are huge problems that require global solutions and global solutions rely on the countries of the world and the citizens of the world to each do their part.

The budget took Australia's spending on foreign aid to 0.35 per cent of our national income—an increase of $530 million from last year. That is on track to reach 0.5 per cent of national income by 2015, which meets our Millennium Development Goals comm­itment. Of course, our aid spending does much more than just meet a target. Australia's foreign aid programs make a real difference to the lives of thousands of people, many of them in our immediate region where 18 of our 20 closest neighbours are among the poorest nations in the world. Our aid dollars immunise and educate children, develop better crops, provide clean water and deliver health care.

Better lives for people wherever they live and whatever their circumstances means a better and safer world.

Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the field of foreign policy as exercised by our former Prime Minister and now Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Griffith. He lurches from one disaster to another, from one train wreck to the next.

In China, the foreign minister lectured them on human rights and then worried about the Manchurian candidate moniker starting to stick. So when he was sitting next to the Chinese ambassador in a TV interview in London he quickly changed the seating arrangements. How humiliating was that?

I mention particularly the opposition immigration spokesperson, the member for Cook; the shadow parliamentary secretary, Senator Bernardi; and the member for Dawson, who made some interesting comments in the House yesterday:

It was not some empty leftie, politically correct ideal; my core belief is that everyone matters. This includes the nearly 5,000 people in Moreton who identify as Muslim.

If you listened to the opposition, you would think that places like Moreton, where one in three people were born overseas, were a melting pot of racial tension and division. Nothing could be further from the truth.

If they were to visit, what would they see? If they were to share a meal with me at Michael's Oriental Restaurant, a place where Chinese, Muslims and the rest of us converge, would they still revolt against multiculturalism?

They raised more than $50,000 for the flood effort, to be distributed to individuals. They were hands-on distributing meals to flooded households, to volunteers and to police on the streets—no prayers, just a practical helping hand. Together, they cooked more than 2,000 meals, and 20 Muslim tradespeople from

The last time we had politicians—redheaded ones—exaggerating racial division, one of the mosques in my electorate was firebombed. That is why I will not allow the voices of fear and ignorance to reign again. They deserve no oxygen and they deserve the strongest condemnation from everyone on both sides of the chamber. My commitment to the people of Moreton on the date of my first speech, 17 February 2008, remains my commitment now: that we should not tolerate voices that seek to divide the community; instead we should recognise those that are doing great work and are keeping our community together. That is the sort of Moreton that I am fighting for and that is the sort of Australia that I would hope all people in this chamber are fighting for.

Travel between my electorate and Canberra on a high-speed rail network would take about two hours. When you add travel time to and from the airports for the equivalent journey by air, two hours is not an inconvenient time. When you consider that the journey could be completed with comfortable seats, phone and internet access and a carbon footprint a mere fraction of the air equivalent, its benefits are compelling.

My office has been bombarded with correspondence calling for high-speed rail—three hours from Melbourne to Sydney and four hours from Canberra to Newcastle. A high-speed rail link on Australia's east coast, through Canberra, would provide fast, reliable and sustainable transport for 75 per cent of our population.

Last year, Spain budgeted $50 billion to extend its network. Meanwhile, China is undertaking an extraordinary $1 trillion, 13,000 km build.

The link would also generate thousands of jobs and promote regional development.

The first phase is on track to be completed by July and will identify requirements for a viable high-speed rail network, including consideration of route and station options and costing. For the second phase, the government has committed to a strategic study on the implementation of high-speed rail on the east coast of Australia.

I would hope that the push for a national high-speed rail network is not being undermined by short-sightedness. The Newcastle-Sydney connection is one of the most difficult parts of an east-coast high-speed rail network to engineer, probably requiring large amounts tunnelling. Per kilometre, the Melbourne-Sydney leg will be cheaper and more cost effective, and the Sydney-Melbourne air route is the fourth-busiest air corridor in the world.

The benefits for towns along the way that might grow into cities are very obvious. In the United Kingdom, when the

If you live 300 kilometres away from Melbourne you cannot commute; with high-speed rail you could do it on a regular basis. I and the Greens will be working hard to ensure that the priority will be given to a national network and not to a scaled back pilot for the minister's backyard in New South Wales.

The community rallied on many fronts but was exposed in a number of areas that are worthy of some policy consideration as a consequence of the natural disaster. The estimated damage bill is significant. All five councils in the Lyne electorate were declared to be disaster areas. The estimated cost to tourism at this stage, from that week alone, is around $14 million. The wider impact at this stage is around $35 million. That is before we get into the various costs for infrastructure and insurance on personal property.

For it to be cut for around three or four days is a significant cost to business and a significant impost to the 11,000 to 12,000 users on a daily basis. With the tourism hat on, I would welcome all visitors to the mid-North Coast. We are now open for business. The weather has been great over the last week, the waters have receded well and most businesses are back to normal. Any support from visitors would be welcome.

Dairy farmers, for example, had to tip milk into nearby rivers and lost trade as a result. Medical supplies had to be choppered in to various locations. Hospital emergencies had to be dealt with. About 3,500 people could not return home for a significant amount of time, so evacuation centres were set up. The damage bill in Kempsey alone is around $8 million dollars.

I am sure that members of one of the oldest rugby league teams in Australia, the Wingham Tigers, were all settled in front of their TVs, probably cracking the first beer, when one of their mates rang another friend. The entire club went around to this guy's—Mick Bailey's—house. Rather than watch the football, which is the Oscars in rugby league terms, they assisted—over the hour and a half to two hours—a bloke who was in desperate need and needed a lot of stuff moved very quickly. The Wingham Tigers definitely showed a club and an Australian spirit and the story is one of those great stories of resilience that come out of natural disasters such as this.

One of those is to create a standard definition of floods. We are already getting reports from various residents who thought they were doing the right thing—they thought they had flood insurance—but have found themselves exposed. That is potentially financial ruin for some. We need to address that as a parliament. The other is the outstanding issue of local councils being left with a huge local roads- and timber-bridge-building program that they cannot complete.

The community's capacity to recover relies not just on the toughness of the local people who live in the area. The response has been significantly enhanced by the great work of our local emergency services workers. As in the case of every natural disaster that has occurred on the North Coast, our local emergency services volunteers have been fantastic and do a great job to assist those in need. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work done by our emergency services personnel and their skill, professionalism and dedication to the people they protect. I commend their work to the House.

It is renowned for its famous G8 Airvan, which is often described as the 'ute of the sky'. It is a very practical aircraft and more than 160 have already been sold throughout Australia and the world. Although the company faced some challenges in the wake of the global financial crisis, where it was difficult for people to secure finance to purchase aircraft, it is now owned by the Indian based firm Mahindra. The production of aircraft, however, remains firmly based in Gippsland and they are doing some excellent work in that regard.

Another exciting initiative on the way at the moment is to recertify and begin production in Gippsland of the GA18, well known to the aviation enthusiasts in the community as the Nomad. This is an 18-seat, twin turboprop aircraft which is capable of landing and taking off in semi-prepared strips, which is obviously an attraction in developing nations in particular but also throughout regional Australia, where strips are sometimes not up to metropolitan area standards. It is a versatile aircraft, and the aim is to have certification by 2014, with production to commence after that date. These are very exciting plans and it is contingent upon all levels of government to work with the industry to help the aviation sector flourish in the Gippsland region.

Historically, this has proven to be a fantastic idea. David went on to try and get funding to create these centres for science education. He was successful in 2008 with my help and, I must say, with the help of the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Minister Carr, and the then education minister,

It has tremendous collaboration and partnerships, as I mentioned, with a number of universities throughout the mainland, also with business partners and other auspicers, and most especially with many, many schools. I note that in the period to 2010, for instance, something like 45,000 students have had careers information presentations made to them. The centres have informed around 800 students in years 11 and 12 about study and career opportunities during specific science industry camps and specific industry placements. They have conducted professional development programs for nearly 900 secondary science teachers, using select primary industries to demonstrate the relevant science, and they have supported something like 4,000 secondary school students and their teachers in participation in science investigation awards. Some of the topics they are investigating at these high schools include the effect of oil spills on marine environments, vitamin C content in ageing lemons, what makes the best home desalination plant, the decomposition of food matter, and heart rates and

He was Australia's 12th Auditor-General. I did not know Mr Taylor, but I remember him from his time as Auditor-General. Many members from that time will remember some of the Auditor-General's reports, including on the sports rorts affair. He was Auditor-General at the time of that issue, but that is not why I speak today. I wanted to take the opportunity to pay tribute to him and recognise the importance of his office.

It is for this reason I think the parliament should take the time to pay tribute to Mr Taylor, given his former position. As I said, the role of Auditor-General is critical within our parliament. The checks and balances are vital to a proper functioning democracy, and the oversight provided by the Auditor-General and his office is of critical importance in that regard. This is something we should always recognise within this parliament. It is something that the founding fathers themselves recognised. The Auditor-General's effectiveness is governed not just by the resources he has but, critically, by his independence and the 10-year independent term that he has and his appointment being made by the parliament.

This was no small thing to achieve and I want to pay tribute today to the people who made the day such a wonderful event.

Sue Lewis as the principal of Copacabana school has been an outstanding advocate for connecting our community in Copacabana to people and to place. The photographic exhibition was also wonderfully coordinated by Sandy James. I want to say that next year you should all do the Five Lands Walk on the Central Coast.

No honourable member of course is compelled to remain in the Main Committee and I do understand that the member for Robertson consulted before she left to join the quorum in the main chamber, so there is no criticism intended of anyone. I was just wondering whether the whips collectively might consider if in the future the Main Committee ought to be allowed to proceed to do its business. It is a matter for the whips; there is nothing I can do about it. But it seems to have been something which has occurred only in the last couple of days, and I gather that in years past that was not a practice that has been adopted. The honourable member for Shortland, I think, wishes to comment on my comment.

Earlier this year, the world watched on as the Egyptian people stood up for their own freedom in the early part of what has been described as the Arab Spring. They were momentous events that many of us in this place watched with great interest, and that were watched across the world with great interest. Particularly to those who believe in the cause of freedom, they were events that we should be celebrating.

We, of course, want that role to continue into the future. Some of us have been concerned, and many people of sound mind across the world have been concerned, about the potential for the vacuum which has been created in Egypt to be filled by people who wish to install a new type of vicious dictatorship rather than a free and open society, which we would hope could come from the events earlier this year. This is a similar outcome to what happened in Iran's revolution in 1979. In this respect, I raise the circumstances of a young American university student, Ilan Grapel, a dual US-Israeli citizen studying law in the United States. His family are in the United States and he was a former congressional intern. Mr Grapel has an Australian link, working for some time with Colin Rubenstein as an intern at the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council just a couple of years ago. Disturbingly, Mr Grapel was arrested by Egyptian state security officers early this month. He remains in detention. He was alleged to have been involved in espionage and fomenting sectarian strife in Egypt. These allegations at best seem far-fetched and when you consider that Mr Grapel is a regular visitor to the Middle East and had entered Egypt under his own name on his own passport and was posting daily messages on Facebook, the allegations do raise significant concerns.

One such program in the Shortland electorate is operating out of the career skills education section at Belmont TAFE. It is federally funded under the Youth at Risk program and it is for 15- to 16-year-olds who have become disengaged from school. This program is getting some fantastic outcomes. The course is at certificate II level and includes vocational as well as general education units. The aim is to engage young people so that they complete the course, gain some vocational skills and then move on and find employment. There is a variety of organisations involved with the program: the Lake Macquarie

Initially, 19 youths were assessed and enrolled. Their literacy and numeracy was assessed and, as a consequence, they have received intensive literacy and numeracy support. The students' behaviour was challenging and that was expected. They lacked concentration, were unable to listen to direction or accept authority and had issues about how they related to other people. The course teachers were aware of these difficulties and the disadvantage of these young people, and the course was structured around those needs. This initiative has been really beneficial to those young students. These youth at risk students are now happy to be there and their attendance is very consistent. Community service youth work students are satisfying their requirements with their work placements. The staff involved have also benefited from their involvement with these young people. The staff-student ratio is one on one. The trial has been at Belmont TAFE and it has worked well with the schools. This is a great program, it involves volunteer tutors and trained qualified teachers and it has enhanced the relationship between the TAFE and local high schools.

There are many young people in our community who suffer from the pressures that unemployment and rising cost-of-living pressures put on their families, and they simply are not coping very well at mainstream schools despite the best efforts of those schools to accommodate them.

Here they have designed programs in order to re-engage girls with the community and with educational programs when they are at risk of falling through the cracks and being lost to the education system. The schools in my community are able to refer girls who may be marginalised or at risk of marginalisation from the education system. In fact, many girls who participate in the program return to mainstream schooling or undertake further study.

It provides a calm and supportive environment in which the girls who attend are able to realise their potential through participating in a wide range of educational experiences and learning opportunities. Learning experiences are tailored to be hands-on and practical. Girls ride horses, cook and engage in drama and art activities.

This is an activity they undertake every Wednesday, and on the menu were satays and salad. I was impressed by the cooperative and friendly way that the girls were going about preparing the meal, setting the table and interacting with each other. It was a great environment to be in.

There was not one girl who did not want to continue with her education. Most of us understand that education and training are the keys to employment. However, for some kids in my community it just is not easy to attend school, finish year 12 and go on to achieve some additional qualification that will help them to find a satisfying job. The Shekinah centre provides a safety net for some of these kids, and it is to be commended for the work it does with the girls who attend its program. Certainly, the girls I met were interested, engaged and eager to make a contribution to their community. I look forward to my next visit.

It continues to make a positive impact on the lives of its students, particularly through the work it is doing with the Gillard government's national partnerships funding. It has also been home to hundreds of our finest educators, including former state member for Penrith the Hon. Faye Lo Po, who began her teaching career at the school as a young 19-year-old. I would like to thank those teachers past and present for their wonderful work. St Marys Public School has a uniquely rich history and I look forward to seeing it continue to play a significant role in our local community over many years to come.

In the four years to 2007, the amount of waste generated grew by nearly a third, to around 44 million tonnes, which is the equivalent of over 2,000 kilograms for each Australian each year. Over the same period, the amount of hazardous waste has doubled. Even if the current recycling level of about 52 per cent is maintained, this trend could result in an almost threefold increase in the waste generated over the coming decade.

The waste stream today is markedly different from 50 years ago when motor vehicles, refrigerators and televisions were less common, and home computers, mobile phones and compact fluorescent lamps did not exist. Today's goods are increasingly complex, and not only contain materials that can be re-used but also contain hazardous substances. As a result of their increasingly short product life, these goods now comprise a significant and growing component of the waste stream. At end of life, these products are placing a disproportionate burden on the general community rather than on those who use them or benefit from their use. Sharing responsibility is central to product stewardship.

Product stewardship can play a part as one of the means by which to achieve these goals.

Under the Stockholm convention, some flame retardant chemicals present in many products are to be restricted or banned. There is also emerging global agreement on directions to reduce mercury emissions.

It is also harmful in minute amounts, and long-term, daily exposure above 25 millionths of a gram per cubic metre is considered unsafe. To place in context the importance of responsible end-of-life management of products—over 50 million lamps containing mercury, in particular street lights and commercial lighting, were imported into Australia in 2008 and these contained approximately 600 kilograms of mercury.

A single piece of legislation that allows for the consistent regulation of products and materials provides a more effective mechanism than an array of individual product legislation at both Commonwealth and state levels.

Some of these schemes are familiar. DrumMuster recycles used agricultural and veterinary chemical containers and has reformulated products to reduce packaging and waste.

Extensive consultation has been undertaken over the past two years, with strong levels of participation. To date over 1,000 people have attended some 80 public and bilateral meetings, and there have been around 320 public submissions.

Three types of product stewardship arrangements will be catered for. Industries and products may be regulated through either a co-regulatory or mandatory approach and voluntary product stewardship schemes can be accredited.

Importantly there is also a comprehensive suite of checks and balances built into the framework to ensure it is appropriate and transparent.

It sets out the governance arrangements, the powers of the regulator, and the reporting and audit requirements for organisations delivering product stewardship schemes. It provides the offences and penalties together with the compliance and enforcement powers.

The product must also satisfy specified criteria, including whether the product is in a national market. As each product, material and industry is unique, the regulations will set out the details of what is to be regulated and the actions to be taken.

There may be a requirement to reduce hazardous substances or to manage the waste as a resource. Importantly, there may be the obligation to ensure that products or waste from products is reused, recycled, recovered, treated or disposed of in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.

In particular, product stewardship organisations that are accredited will meet specific reporting and audit requirements, which will provide for both transparency and accountability.

A company will not be able to benefit from refusing to participate, so there will be no free-riders. Thresholds may be applied to avoid impacts on small business.

The bill provides a comprehensive set of product stewardship requirements that can be drawn upon for that purpose. These include the ability to require labelling, to require producers to take products back at the end of life for recycling or to require a deposit and refund be applied to a product. These requirements are based on those already in use, such as those in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989.

Around 32 million new television and computer products were sold in Australia in 2008, with an estimated 16.8 million units reaching end of life in the same year. Only 10 per cent are recycled, which is well below the average rate of recycling for all waste of 52 per cent. The volume of television and computer products reaching end of life is expected to grow to 44 million per year by 2028. This electronic waste is classified as hazardous waste under the

Over time, that mercury found its way into the food chain. In particular, it found its way into the shellfish, the crustaceans and the general fish community. It was ingested. The early 1950s saw what was sometimes known as the drunken cat syndrome, where small animals began to suffer and lost their motor coordination. Progressively this fed into the situation faced by the people of Minamata. It was an early warning sign in the postwar period of the danger, the impact, the hazard of heavy metal poisoning on the human population.

But what occurred in Minamata and what occurred through the negligence of the Chisso Corporation was a message that progressively made its way around the world—the message being that we have responsibility for the stewardship of our products and we have responsibility for the by-products and consequences which flow from our products. Against that background of the Minamata disease, as it was known, and the profound impact it had on the people and the life of the fishing community of Minamata, we now come to the situation where product stewardship is a legitimate, important national responsibility for Australia in the 21st century.

There are points of disagreement but there are also significant areas of agreement. Currently, the opposition and the government are engaged in three major areas of cooperative activity. Firstly, there is this product stewardship legislation. Secondly, we have recently provided support for the government's revised vehicle emissions standards. That is an important direct action measure which the government has taken and to which we have given our support. Thirdly, we have also accepted—although we have some concerns about the way in which it was done—the changes to the fringe benefits tax to prevent the ludicrous situation of people driving enormous distances immediately prior to the cut-off date for the annual calculation of kilometres, thereby increasing emissions, fuel usage and waste in our society. These changes will end the windfall gain to be received by driving further, although we do have some concerns about the impact on legitimate, proper activities of tradespeople and people involved in travelling sales.

Where we disagree, it is not disagreement for the sake of it but disagreement on the basis of an alternative principle—a concern either about the structure or the implementation. In the same way that, right from the outset, we identified the home insulation program as a potential, an emerging and finally an actual disaster—on each occasion eliciting a denial by the government that such a problem either would be faced or was actually being faced—we now place our concerns on the record about using a massive electricity, petrol, gas and grocery tax as the means to reduce Australian emissions.

The Product Stewardship Bill 2011 establishes a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed during and at the end of its life. This bill is about providing a structure for whole-of-life management of consumer products and the components contained within them. Very simply, it is about making sure that in the 21st century there are no more Minamatas and that we do not face the

There was discussion of the principle in November 2009 but I know discussions go back to previous years. I was involved myself in a discussion in Christchurch some years ago, on behalf of the Australian government, with the New Zealand government and the Australian states. There is a long heritage of bipartisan support for the concept and the direction, and I am pleased that we have been able to work with the government to achieve appropriate changes and amendments which will allow for a joint approach.

The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship. This is the notion of shared responsibility for reducing the environmental health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the lifecycle of a product. That is drawn directly from the National Waste Policy. We support that concept; it is about doing things in a correct and appropriate fashion that will not inadvertently drive up the cost of living for Australians but will deal with the problem directly, head-on and in a way which can solve the problem at source. In particular, the coalition also supports the notion of voluntary schemes. Voluntary product stewardship schemes as set out in part 2 of the bill which sit alongside co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes offer a very prospective way forward.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>

I praise the work of coalition members Senator Simon Birmingham and Senator Mary Jo Fisher, both of whom have worked with the government. In particular, the coalition worked with Senator Don Farrell on a series of amendments. The result of those amendments is that there are now three very specific criteria for developing and recognising schemes for accreditation under this bill. The first element is that the system be focused very much on containing hazardous waste substances, the second element is that there be a clear test on the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products or increase the recovery of resources from waste from the products, and the third element is that there be the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products or substances in the products have on the environment or on the health or safety of human beings. The origins of the last element can be traced back not just to Minamata but to some of the tragedies we saw through industrialisation in the 19th century.

The magnitude of Australia's waste stream has reached such a point that, in the four years to 2007, the amount of waste generated in Australia rose by 31 per cent, equating to approximately 2,000 kilograms for every Australian every year. Furthermore, over this same time frame, hazardous waste has doubled in Australia. However, these figures were recorded over a period when Australia's resource recovery from waste had also increased to 22.7 million tonnes or approximately 52 per cent. That is to say that despite increased action in the recovery of waste, Australia's production of waste is still growing each year. This comparison illustrates how significant work targeted at reducing the impact of Australia's waste is being negatively offset by the gradual increase in waste generated. In doing so it also highlights the significance of the bill before the House today.

Firstly, it implements a commitment to the National Waste Policy by establishing a national framework underpinned by legislative support; this means government-supported action on waste management. Secondly, it seeks to combat Australia's problem of increasing waste generation by extending the responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety impacts of manufactured goods and materials across the entire lifecycle of a product. The National Waste Policy announced in 2009 heralds a new, coherent, efficient and environmentally responsible approach to the management of waste in Australia. I think this is important because we do have many organisations that are out there working very hard; organisations such as

Product stewardship effectively facilitates these aims by providing industry, communities and governments with a consistent national approach to the management of certain products. It engages with those involved in the production, supply and use of products to share the responsibility for the environmental impact throughout a product's life from its production through to its disposal. Product stewardship provides a basis for either voluntary, co-regulated or mandated actions to be taken by manufacturers, importers, distributors and others with regard to avoiding the generation of waste, reducing or eliminating the amount of waste from products to be disposed of, reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in products and waste from products, managing waste from products and resources and ensuring that products and waste from products are treated, disposed of, recovered, recycled and reused in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.

The co-regulated approach will provide industry with flexibility in how they achieve their minimum outcomes and operational requirements. It may also be applied in situations where a substantial part of an industry wants to take action but is concerned about the remainder of the industry freely benefiting from their efforts.

Such schemes could require that specified actions be taken with regard to the reuse, recycling, treatment or disposal of particular products, or even prohibit the manufacture or importing of products deemed to contain hazardous substances. Australia's waste is not only growing but its nature is also rapidly changing. Today televisions, computers, mobile phones and fluorescent lamps are consumed in mass amounts. Goods are becoming increasingly complex and now contain materials that cannot be reused and are potentially hazardous. Furthermore, these particular products have their expected longevity drastically reduced and, therefore, greatly contribute to Australia's waste stream.

It broke down within, perhaps, about three months, so I took it back for repair. They said that it was much cheaper to buy a new product and that it was not something that you repair, you just buy a new one. These things are only meant to last for about a year. It is important to note that these products are becoming a problem. The short-life products are now placing a disproportionate burden on the general community rather than solely on those who benefit from their use. Product stewardship rebalances this burden by placing responsibility across the manufacture, consumption and disposal chain.

Attempts to reduce Australia's waste will benefit greatly from a consistent piece of legislation governing the manufacture of products and materials. A national approach to product stewardship also has a huge financial advantage over state based regulations.

The product stewardship scheme, as part of the national waste scheme, is the result of extensive stakeholder and community consultation. It has been endorsed, as I said, by all Australian governments and has received broad support from business and industry communities.

I am pleased to hear that the opposition will support this bill because it is a very important bill. Usually they oppose, but they are going to support this bill and I certainly welcome that. I commend the bill to the House.

The bill will put in place a more effective and consistent approach to reducing the impact of products and hazardous substances in products on the environment and on human health. The bill follows significant consultation starting in 2009 with the National Waste Policy. That policy, which was endorsed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments, committed to national product stewardship legislation. This bill meets that commitment. I commend the bill to the House.

This assistance is aimed at encouraging students to take up higher education and higher level skill qualifications by reducing the financial barriers associated with study.

The changes will simplify administrative requirements delivering efficiencies to both providers and the Commonwealth, to improve the Commonwealth's ability to manage provider risk, to increase the rate of provider approval, and therefore increase the number of students able to access income contingent loans through quality providers in both the higher education and VET sectors.

As a nation we need to deepen and broaden our skills base if we are to be well placed to compete at a global level. We need to boost participation and ensure that our workers are appropriately trained so that we do not risk having economic growth constrained by lack of qualified staff. We need to ensure that we utilise the VET sector as best we can in addressing these future needs.

The highest growth scenario based on current policy settings would see Australia needing an additional 2.4 million people in the workforce with qualifications at Certificate III and higher by 2015. Under the former coalition government income contingent loans were extended to the VET sector in 2007, enabling provision of student loans for diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses. This followed on from the provision of FEE-HELP to domestic students who chose to undertake non-Commonwealth funded courses at universities and approved private providers. This was to ensure that students wishing to pursue a vocation were provided with financial assistance similar to that on offer to university students through the

This system previously made it difficult for students who had financial constraints to access VET opportunities. Income contingent loans enhance accessibility to study for many Australians who may otherwise be precluded due to financial circumstances. Often the only thing preventing young Australians from following the employment pathway of their choosing is their ability to fund their study or to support themselves while studying.

If we can make VET courses a financial reality for these young people, we may be able to prevent another generation of disengaged and disenfranchised Australians. Particularly given the rampant skills shortages facing Australia today, it is more important than ever that young Australians are able to access vocational qualifications that lead to sustainable employment opportunities. Many VET qualifications address the skill and demand, and it is critical that students are given every opportunity to undertake these courses.

The most recent data available from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations show that in 2009 only 5,262 students had income contingent loans with only 50 institutions approved to offer it. This bill seeks to increase access to VET FEE-HELP loans by enabling more providers to become approved institutions and to ensure that students who may otherwise be unable to study a VET course are in fact able to do so. Many of these courses target areas of real skills shortages. Given the current skills crisis facing this country, it is critical that we assist young Australians, enabling them to gain skills and career opportunities. Looking forward, we will need many more people with foundation and higher level skills. Skills Australia in their discussion paper,

This provides a safeguard to protect against those providers who unfortunately bring the sector into disrepute. It will hopefully go some way to boosting public confidence in a sector that has been damaged in recent years by a number of unethical providers offering substandard qualifications. By simplifying the administrative requirements for providers whilst managing the Commonwealth's ability to manage provider risk, a greater number of providers will be deemed eligible to offer loans and more students will benefit from this access to income contingent loans through FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. This is about more than just ensuring that VET students are afforded the same opportunities for funding assistance as those following a tertiary pathway. The coalition is intent on reiterating that a vocational qualification holds the same importance as a tertiary parchment and that VET qualifications will increasingly be in demand. I commend the bill to the House.

VET FEE-HELP is part of the Higher Education Loan Program and is an extension of the higher education student loan scheme, FEE-HELP. The amendments will ensure that a higher education or VET provider is a fit and proper body before they are approved; therefore, ensuring the integrity of these programs. The proposed amendments will be broadly consistent with the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, following the recommendations of the Beard review of the proposed regulator. Requirements will be developed for inclusion in legislative instruments made under the act and where possible streamlining the use of existing Commonwealth regulatory frameworks. The amendments will allow the minister to qualify approvals of higher education or VET providers by imposing conditions on providers and specifying these conditions in the notice of approval. The minister will be able to vary or remove conditions which have been imposed. Placing conditions on the approval and continued approval of a body corporate as a VET or higher education provider will allow the minister the power to approve a body corporate as a VET or higher education provider while imposing conditions to better manage the risks that may be associated with that particular organisation. If these conditions are breached, approvals could be suspended and/or revoked. The amendments will allow the minister the discretion to approve a higher education or VET provider where the body's principal purpose may not be education, as long as its purpose does not conflict with its purpose to provide education. This would allow education providers that are dual or multi-purpose organisations to be approved as a higher education or VET providers without significantly diminishing the quality requirements of the educational provision.

They will also allow the minister a reasonable period of time between issuing a higher education or VET provider a notice of suspension and making a decision regarding revocation of provider approval. This provides the minister with more time to investigate possible breaches and make an informed decision.

The amendments will introduce a fit and proper person requirement to ensure that applicants are fit and proper for that purpose. This will ensure that senior officers and directors, or persons who are in a position of influence in terms of the management of the applicant, must demonstrate that they are fit and proper persons to be approved as a VET or higher education provider.

The first thing it has done is attack public sector workers. It attacked them straight away by trying to take away their conditions, taking away the conditions of nurses and firefighters. It is an absolute disgrace that an incoming government chooses to pick on these vital public service areas when what they should be doing is supporting this government's reforms in higher education, of which this bill is an important part, and making sure that we can make the changes needed in education so that we can develop the economy. But, no: we have an opposition that is all opposition and no substance; it has no policy whatsoever.

By having that university we are giving the opportunity to local kids to go to university. This government has been particularly supportive of the University of Newcastle's Central Coast campus in terms of capital funding for a new library and library extensions and for the health sciences and places in nursing. The sorts of jobs that we have on the Central Coast are the sorts of investments both in human capital and in physical capital that have been made at the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle.

As a result of those investments, we are seeing local kids going to a local university and not having to travel down to Sydney—a round trip of four hours which often sees local kids dropping out of university or TAFE because it is simply too much to expect with the pressure of university. We have seen much higher levels of young people going to our campus, finishing their degrees and being available to meet the requirements that modern employers are seeking from their workforce now: a more educated workforce and a more technically savvy workforce. That is why this legislation and this government's program in relation to education, investment in early childhood right through to higher education, is so important.

If we do not have this investment in higher education and education generally, the effect will be that our economy will face impediments in labour supply but also, more importantly, in productivity.

But they just did the lazy thing; they watched the money roll in from the mining boom mark 1 and did nothing. They did nothing in terms of the structural reform that was required in higher education and did nothing to make sure the labour market was going to be skilled properly to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The previous government chose to do nothing on those issues.

The minister has finally come to the view, as I knew she inevitably would move away from her student days, that it is appropriate for us to allow private providers and people in the education sector to participate and make a contribution to the education of young Australians. For too long in this country the government has always been the answer to education and there has been the view, simply put, that people ought not to make a contribution to their own education. That is the view of this government and of ministers within this government.

When you get education you get an economic asset and an improvement in your ability to function in the economy. That is a valuable thing—it is something that has a real return to you as a person and in your career prospects—therefore, you should make a contribution to it. That is why

That is why the Howard government extended VET FEE-HELP to be accessed by people in different institutions in the economy and in society. It has been so successful because education has become one of our bigger export markets—well it was until very recently when we had some troubles and regulatory problems imposed by this government.

This bill is a good thing because it recognises that. I praise the minister for finally coming to that view. She has shed her student activist days when she opposed all of the things covered in this bill. She has come to the table responsibly and recognised that it is important for us to have a vibrant education sector in terms of education colleges. I think that is a positive development.

I think it is good to streamline what is going on in this sector. In that intention I think the government has got it right here. The intention to simplify arrangements for VET providers to ensure quality providers apply for and can offer these income contingent loans is a good development. Income contingent loans were offered by the Howard government in 2007 and extended to the vocational education and training sector, which was a good development as well.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level. Again, it is good to say to people: 'You have received an economic contribution from the taxpayer. You ought to make a contribution to your own education because of the added value you get from that education.' It is a worthwhile and smart system to say to people early on: 'As a government, we will use a carrot instead of a stick. We will provide the incentives that enable you to get the education and access to skills that you need to do better and lift yourself economically and socially. You can seek and achieve whatever you want to do with the skills that you learn, but you then must make a contribution to society for that education.' That system has been proven to work.

It is good, through the provisions of this bill, that it is changing. In 2009 only 5,262 students received income-contingent loans. Of course, there were only 50 registered training organisations available. With the diversity of organisations out there in the economy today offering diplomas or other types of degrees and courses, it is great that we are expanding this system in order to take into account the diversity of this sector.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It has been a great success story for the Australian economy. The education sector is doing very well in spite of what I regard as significant regulatory burdens imposed by state and federal governments. In many cases these regulatory burdens are there for good reasons, but in many cases they are there simply to require further bureaucracy and administration on very fine and worthy institutions that really need to be allowed to get on with the job of providing courses that local and foreign students seek. Of course, that is the subject for another debate.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </p>

I support that intention in this bill. I urge that it not be so restrictive that it does not recognise the diversity of bodies and courses in the modern Australian economy because we want to encourage diversity and plurality. We should not seek competition between the public and private providers because we want to encourage capital investment in education.

It is not only up to the government to do things, and that is where the member for Dobell and the minister fail in their intentions. It is not just the role of government. There are many capable, qualified and successful providers of diplomas, degrees and other courses in our economy today and they ought to have the ability to function properly and successfully. So while the government is introducing a bill which enables and extends VET FEE-HELP to more areas in our economy, it also seems that the member for Dobell simply does not understand that we need these things to promote more private capital into education so that we can have more operators and courses to educate people.

These loans use a carrot and not a stick by saying, 'We are going to provide incentives at an early stage for you to get educated and get yourself ahead.' This is a good approach to government.

The loan system that the Howard government extended to the vocational education and training sector in 2007 is working. This is a worthy set of measures to ensure that system is expanded to more sectors of our economy. I am personally encouraged by the minister's contribution today. She is moving away from compulsory unionism and her days of student activism where it was always about the state educating students. She is recognising that we have a vibrant education industry in Australia today that is not just government funded or controlled. We will continue to promote measures that encourage not only the education sector to flourish but also the expansion of fit and proper education providers in our economy.

A lot of that, as we know from our research and surveys, is to do with the costs of leaving home to study, so there is not much point in just offering help with fees at your university, TAFE or registered training organisation if in fact you cannot afford to feed yourself or pay the rent when it comes to living away from home to undertake that course.

The intention of FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP was to ensure greater equity between students in the tertiary sector and those studying for a vocational qualification. Why should there be any difference or discrimination between students guiding themselves into those different career pathways? After all, the incomes for those who undertake a trade qualification may be much higher than for those who complete a tertiary degree or postgraduate study. Certainly in our community you cannot argue that one career is of greater value to the economy or the community than another. So it is, I think, very important that we have equity of access to government funded support between those who go into the tertiary sector and those who go into the vocational streams. VET FEE-HELP loans were introduced by the then coalition government, and the coalition has remained and is today strongly supportive of the program.

It provides a loan for all or part of a student's tuition costs. Under FEE-HELP you can borrow up to the amount of the tuition fee being charged by your provider for your study. However, over your lifetime you can borrow only up to the FEE-HELP limit. Eligible people may borrow up to the FEE-HELP limit to pay tuition fees over their lifetime. In 2011 the FEE-HELP limit was $86,422, unless a person was undertaking medicine, dentistry or veterinary science which led to an initial registration as a medical practitioner, dentist, vet or veterinary surgeon. If they are in those areas of work, the FEE-HELP limit is increased to $108,029, and of course FEE-HELP is indexed on 1 January each year.

VET FEE-HELP assists eligible students to undertake certain VET courses of study, diplomas, advanced diplomas, graduate certificates and graduate diploma courses with an approved VET provider by paying all or part of the course. Students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level of $44,911 for 2011.

This has to be of great concern to the communities of Tasmania and the Northern Territory, where there are skills gaps and enormous shortages of tradesmen and tradeswomen and where the costs of leaving to study elsewhere are very substantial. We need to do detailed work to understand why we have a shortage of RTOs, or indeed TAFEs, in those places. Governments need to consider the circumstances of places like the Northern Territory and Tasmania because the future skills availability in those parts of Australia is a major problem. Given that there is a great deal of unemployment in those areas, as well as skills shortages, we must do better when it comes to assisting students to access these income contingent loans.

I have to say that 788 students who accessed VET FEE-HELP were from regional and remote areas, only 15 per cent of the total, and there were only 890 students of low socioeconomic status, or 17 per cent. Clearly this potential assistance to students is not being used effectively. We have a long way to go before a student can rule out the cost of their fees being a barrier to them going from their year 12 studies onto a pathway for their preferred career.

Some 19 per cent of them were employed either full or part time, which left us with a significant number who were looking for work but were unemployed. There was another one per cent not in the labour force, education or training. I find it very sad that at the end of year 12 a significant number of our students are not stepping immediately into a career or into education and training, particularly in rural and regional areas where the costs of living can be substantial and the costs of going to be educated elsewhere are substantial. We have to do better and make sure there is not a two-speed economy—one where, in a metropolitan area, you can access education easily and the costs are diminished because you can live at home, and the other where students may only be two or three hours away from a capital city or a big regional centre, as in my electorate, but where students are constrained and substantially discriminated against when it comes to access to a career through further education and training.

Why is it that we have almost double the number of students deferring in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas? The answer, again, is pretty simple—it is about costs. I guess the government has been waiting for me to raise the issue of independent youth allowance. This has been one of the biggest problems, compared to any other factor, affecting the capacity of rural and regional students to take up tertiary studies. This also extends into the VET sector, where you do not have big TAFEs offering a range of courses within commuting distance of your home. If you cannot afford the $20,000 or so to live away from home then you simply defer your studies and, despite your offer, try and get work and try and match, if you are in the inner region, the new criteria that this government is insisting upon. But, of course, those new criteria for the inner regions make it impossible for you to gain independent youth allowance.

It is a very serious problem right throughout northern Victoria, where we have the lowest rates of enrolment in bachelor degrees, particularly in the Hume region. Only 31 per cent, or less than a third of students, in the Hume region of Victoria are enrolling in bachelor degrees. That is slightly below the Gippsland region at 31.3 per cent.

It is a policy problem which should be addressing the costs of having to leave home to study, and this debate we are having today is in part driven by the fact that we have not enough uptake of VET FEE-HELP. Of course, we have had numerous debates in the House and in this committee chamber about the policy failures in relation to independent youth allowance.

If we fail to invest in education—whether it is for a trade, a skilled occupation or a university occupation—and fail to give our students that opportunity then we can expect to fall further and further behind in productivity for our nation and in our competitiveness compared to those that we try and keep step with in terms of our own domestic economy and in our exporting. While we of course support the administrative changes that this bill is ushering in—after all, as a coalition we were the architects of a program to bring VET students into the mix when it came to fee assistance—we are concerned that not enough students are taking up this option, that there are very limited options for students in the Northern Territory and Tasmania.

We have a very serious problem with our own socioeconomic status in northern Victoria. After seven years of drought, a flood and the impacts of government policy in relation to water access, we have families who are getting more and more stressed financially. We need this support for our students to have a chance in a career of choice and in a career which will add to the value and the wealth of the nation.

We cannot have enormous numbers of deferrals—in fact, double the number of deferrals—for year 12 students when you compare metropolitan and non-metropolitan uptake. I mentioned those figures before. We cannot have the situation where students have to walk away from a training opportunity because their families cannot afford to pay for their being and studying away from home. That is a nation that is squandering the human capital that we depend on for our futures.

Unfortunately Labor, the Greens and the Independent MPs, with the exception of the member for Kalgoorlie, voted against this motion. This is very disappointing for the students in the electorates of those members on the other side that are missing out on receiving support to help them reach their full potential. The coalition has been continuously calling on the government to make the criteria fairer for inner regional students. The maps currently used are ridiculous and do not accurately reflect the difficulty students from some areas have in getting to university.

It is a long way and, unlike their city cousins, there is no way Mt Gambier residents can go from home to university every day. But if you live in Mt Gambier you are treated just like a student in Adelaide or Melbourne. However, if you live outside the town boundaries, you are treated as you were under the old Howard government conditions. This decision makes no sense. It is based not on any educational criteria but on medical criteria relating to the availability of doctors. It has nothing whatsoever to do with education. As a result of this decision, people living in a reasonably sized city like Mt Gambier, which has 23,000 or 24,000 people, are treated differently from those living outside the town boundaries, even if that boundary lies just across the road.

If you understood Mt Gambier at all, you would know that outside the town boundaries is still part of the urban area which is in the district council of Grant. There are perhaps up to 20,000 other examples of this ridiculous government decision, but Mt Gambier is easier to understand as it is so clearly a long way from the nearest universities. This government has inadvertently drawn random lines on a map and changed the lives of students across Australia.

It is not fair that this government can act so carelessly when students' futures are at risk. University is a crucial part of life that for many students will decide what path their careers take. The coalition has tried to give a voice to these students that are being treated so unfairly, but the government does not seem to want to listen. We have introduced motions and legislation, we have tabled petitions, we have held roundtables, we have spoken to the media over and over again, but this government is so arrogant that it cannot see the error of its ways.

Inner regional students are currently forced to find 30 hours of work per week over an 18-month period, and anyone who has an idea about regional communities would know that this work is very difficult to find—30 hours of work per week is a lot for regional communities to support for even a couple of students who are aspiring to head to university, let alone more. Communities such as those in my electorate do not have endless retail outlets and fast food eateries for young people to work in for 30 hours per week. Small businesses are already feeling the Labor pinch; now we want to ask them to supply jobs for 30 hours per week for an 18-month period. It just does not make sense and in most cases is not possible. I have received a huge number of letters, calls and emails from concerned students and parents over the length of this debate because there is a genuine problem that needs to be fixed. The calls are all different but the stories similar: students are very keen to attend university but cannot afford to do it without the support of

As a representative of a large rural electorate where parents are faced with huge costs to fund their children's university studies hundreds of kilometres away, often to the tune of, say, $15,000 a year, I remain extremely concerned by the government's arrogant dismissal of the very sincere problems caused by the changes to the support arrangements for rural and regional students. This is an opportunity for the government to stop the inequity and get it fixed. Reasonable students are suffering at the hands of an incompetent government which is denying many students fair access to support.

It is not a hard call. There is a very simple way to fix it but this government would rather wait until at least January next year before doing something, if that does in fact even happen. During debate on this matter recently, members on the other side suggested that we are ignoring the government's announcement made a few weeks ago about the increased numbers going to university.

We are trying to address the problem which has been caused by this government.

The problem is that the government did not disclose that there are students receiving only a part rate of allowance. The truth is in the detail once again. During Senate estimates, it was revealed that some students could be getting as little as a few dollars a week of dependent youth allowance, compared to the full rate of $388. I would challenge anyone to be able to afford to attend university on a few dollars a week or fortnight. These students have packed up and moved to the city to attend university because obviously they cannot attend on a daily basis—450 kilometres and not too many of them own a private jet, and I do not think we would be giving them youth allowance if they could afford to fly to university. It is an obvious problem. They cannot go to university on a daily basis so they have to move from home and that costs money.

To claim that 4,250 extra students are getting youth allowance—which we would welcome—denies the fact that many of them are on only a very small portion of that allowance. Even more concerning are the government's plans. Senator Evans was recording as saying:

This issue is not going to go away.

This government thinks it is good at trying to sweep things under the carpet but the coalition will not let this one fade. The future of students in our rural electorates is far too important to just let this issue fade. We must not let the government push the matter aside for another six months or a year. Families in rural electorates have to plan for the future. Students have to plan for the future, but they have no prospect of going to university if this problem is not fixed.

The member for Sturt, the member for Forrest—and I am sure she will give a great contribution on this topic as she always does—and Senator Nash have been fantastic advocates for this cause. But it is now time for the government members to stand up and show the sort of support for students that this side of the House has displayed. I know that the member for Braddon said there are problems in his electorate, but apparently he is prepared to wait for this review. I like the member for Braddon. He is a good man. We came to this parliament together and we have done a lot of committee work together. Unlike him, I am not prepared to wait. We have to fix this problem. We have to give the opportunity to rural students to plan for their futures and help their families to plan for their futures. This issue is too important to be swept under the carpet.

It has been a huge issue and it continues to be a huge issue in my electorate and electorates like mine all around Australia. They have been stymied by a stupid ruling, a stupid line on a map, that is not based on educational criteria or on the ability to go to university. It is based simply on the availability of doctors in a town, not on the ability of students to go to university. As I pointed out, if you live on one side of the street in

It gives me enormous pleasure to again be speaking on a higher education matter in this place. The Gillard government has certainly been a reformist government when it comes to education, increasing the opportunities for students to access the higher education system.

This bill will also better position implementation of the government's 2010 budget measure, Skills for Sustainable Growth. That is certainly something that I welcome and I know all members from the Labor side welcome this quality provision. The Australian government recognise that for some people the payment of up-front tuition fees for higher education and for VET courses is a barrier to study. I know the member for Deakin has raised this matter often. He is a qualified electrician and has a real passion for, and has taken an interest in, making sure that young people have the opportunity to take up a trade and receive a TAFE education as part of that. I certainly welcome his contribution.

The amendments will allow the minister to put in place the necessary approvals for higher education and for VET providers. The minister will be able to vary or remove conditions which have been imposed in the past. I think placing conditions on approval and continued approval is very important.

It has played a very important role in providing training opportunities for young people across Geelong and the western districts. By the nature of my seat, two-thirds of young people that access TAFE training would access that institution with the remainder of people, from the northern part, taking the opportunity to go to the School of Mines in Ballarat, another very old institution. Its roots go back to the gold rush. It has had a very long and proud history of training young people for a very significant period of time in the northern part of my electorate. In the western part, we have the

It has been providing training opportunities for young people. Whilst it is based in Warrnambool, one of its sites, the Glenormiston College, is only just to the west of my electorate and has been providing educational opportunities, particularly in agriculture, for a very long time. It is something I am very proud of. I know many people in the western district have access to training opportunities in the west.

We continue to put in place the necessary reforms to increase participation to enable universities and TAFE colleges to grow in a sustainable way to provide quality educational outcomes for those students. Course costs have been a barrier for access, and Labor has a very proud record, going back a long time, of putting in place opportunities for young people to be able to go to universities or TAFE and have those costs deferred to a later time when they can afford it. We are about removing barriers and we will continue to work hard to reform our education system to ensure that barriers are removed wherever possible, providing people with an opportunity. As a consequence of that, I commend to this place these bills. As I said earlier, I would like to thank the opposition for their cooperation.

This intent also reflected the value the coalition places on the vocational education sector and the very valuable members of our community who choose vocational pathways to achieve their higher level training. These people will become important contributors to the workforce and the economy, particularly in regional areas. Our commitment to VET FEE-HELP is reflected in our intention to ensure greater equity between students in the tertiary sector and those who study vocational qualifications. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as members in this chamber know, I feel very strongly about equity of access, specifically when I consider the issues confronting students in rural and regional areas.

All I can say is that I wish the government would apply that rule to the students who have been defined as living in inner regional areas. I wish that the Labor government shared our strong value to ensure that all students have equity of access to financial support with their higher education and training, but we have seen the exact opposite. We have heard today that on at least five occasions the government has had the opportunity to reverse this decision. These are these great young people; these are not just nameless, faceless people who are affected by this decision. I meet them every day and I meet their families every day. They are great young people who live in regional and rural areas. They have no choice but to move away from their home. They not only leave their home but leave their home town, their friends and their families because they are passionate about studying or need to pursue their education or their courses.

This was quite deliberate. Effectively the government has decided that students from inner regional areas, for some unknown reason that I cannot fathom in all this time, do not deserve the same access to independent youth allowance as other students. What reason could there possibly be for this? I do not understand this. What on earth have these students and their families done so wrong? What have they done to deserve this treatment from the government? We have been bringing this to the government's attention consistently since 2009. What have they done wrong? These students cannot afford to commute—they physically cannot commute—to tertiary educational institutions, and they have no choice but to move away from home and incur the additional costs of living that go with this. They have no choice. These families are not wealthy, unfortunately. Evidence has shown that the cost of relocating is a massive financial barrier that is preventing regional students from undertaking tertiary study.

If you are a young person living on a farm or in a very small community, how do you find 30 hours of work a week for 18 months and where? In these areas, it is seasonal employment for young people with their level of skill. It is extremely difficult, yet they are expected to find 30 hours of work a week for 18 months. That is virtually impossible. No part of my electorate is within practical commuting distance—some are 220 to 250 kilometres away. I constantly receive emails from people affected by this issue. Students currently on their gap year do not know if they are going to qualify and whether they have to work 30 hours a week for 18 months. Where are they going to end up?

I cannot believe the government have treated young people in this way. Families and students have poured their hearts out to the Prime Minister and the government on this issue. I received some information from one of the parents in my electorate and she said: 'What hope have we little people got? The government has no interest or understanding when dealing with the issues facing rural and regional residents.' This parent sent the Prime Minister an email on what is a vitally important issue to that family—whether their child can go to university and whether they had to choose which one can go. Their email, dated Wednesday, 17 June 2009, did not even get a read receipt—in other words, that someone had clicked on it to open it—until an email from the Prime Minister's office dated Friday, 6 May 2011. How do you think that made that family feel? Yes, they are in a regional area. Yes, they have a number of challenges. Does that mean they are less entitled? No, it does not and it should not if this government was genuine.

The government have had five opportunities since that time to lift the barriers to participation. I even have one young person in my electorate who has had to come back because they could not afford to stay away. The family thought that the legislation we put through this House would have some benefit and that the government would listen. So she began her tertiary education but she had to come back because the family could not support her. And I get families in supermarkets saying to me: 'What do we do? We have to choose which one of our children we can afford to send to tertiary education?' What is my answer, Mr Deputy Speaker? I know you would understand this very well. What do I say to these families? This government must give the answers to these families and do not take two years to provide a read receipt when families write with their heartfelt and genuine representation of where they are at.

If the government is genuinely concerned about offering greater participation it should fix this problem first. This is an ongoing problem and I have extremely desperate young people in my electorate who are just crying out for an opportunity. As we heard earlier, some of the figures that were raised do not reflect the falls in the numbers of young people in those inner regional areas who were not able to access independent youth allowance, and those figures certainly do not reflect some of the minor amounts of youth allowance that some are receiving.

If that is going to be the case there will be even less money in the system for those who are currently trying to access youth allowance. Unless the government is planning to put further funding into this capped program, I can see some real problems ahead even for those who are currently accessing youth allowance.

As I said, on five occasions we have introduced opportunities for the government to change this and it is time that the government did so voluntarily. It should not fall upon the opposition to keep bringing this matter before the parliament. The people have spoken over and over again, and two houses of parliament have agreed to this, but the government persists with it.

The state government has increased trainees and apprenticeships by 21 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the past 12 months, which was the highest growth in the nation over the past five years. I note that there were nearly 39,000 apprentices and trainees in training in WA last year. Given that there are $220 billion of resource and infrastructure projects either under construction, committed or under consideration, we need every well-educated, trained and skilled person.

I note that the occupations priority list includes auto electricians, diesel mechanics, heavy duty mechanics, fitters, machinists, welders, metal fabricators, sheetmetal workers, plumbers, tilers, bakers and chefs. Given the challenges facing south-western Western Australia more generally, I hope that the measures included in this bill increase provider approvals and, in practical terms, provide greater accessibility for students to VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP. I am aware also that the state minister Peter Collier's top priority is to prepare Western Australians for the workforce by providing training opportunities and I note that the WA state government committed $33.4 million in this year's budget to fund over 12,000 training places—that is, up to 21,000 places over the last three years. We remain committed to ensuring that students pursuing vocational pathways are provided with financial assistance and I support this bill on that basis, but I make a last plea to this government. You really need to fix the inequity of inner regional students and allow equity of access to students from the south-west and other areas right around Australia to independent youth allowance.

Whether it is tertiary education in the vocational education sector, in TAFE or in university, this government is absolutely committed to seeing improvements after the legacy of lethargy from the coalition when they were in government for 11½ years. The previous speaker was talking about university placements and university funding. For her edification and for that of those who may be listing, we are projecting to increase to $13 billion in 2012 the funding for universities. Enrolments next year are projected to be more than half a million places. Contrast that with what came from those opposite when they were in power, $8 billion in 2007, enrolments of 400,000 in 2008, 20 per cent fewer than expected in 2012. That alone is an indication that the university sector is thriving under this government and that more and more students are going into the tertiary sector.

We want to boost participation. We want to reward work and get people off welfare and into work, to make sure their family's financial security is enhanced and their opportunities and potential are realised. We emphasise increased funding and increased help for the tertiary sector, whether it is in TAFE or university.

It is also about reducing the risk of undesirable providers through the introduction of a fit and proper person test for the management of the personnel of those boards and the introduction of conditions of their recognition. We are going to make sure that education providers, whether they are universities or anyone involved in vocational education, also have appropriate education standards. The people running those institutions are fit and proper. They are people of integrity. The bodies are made up of people who are ethical. We want to make sure that the higher educational sector, while it is very diverse in size, scope and nature, is full of institutions that achieve good outcomes for students. We do not want dodgy degrees or dicky diplomas. We want to make sure that, whatever the person undertakes when they are at TAFE or university, that qualification is recognised internationally and domestically. We want to make sure that the focus at TAFE and university is about the student; their learning experience, their educational outcome and equipping them for the workplace—equipping them for the challenges of changing jobs and making sure that they have not just a ticket, a diploma or a degree but the skills necessary to carry out the work they have been employed to do, whether it is in the mines, the retail sector, the construction industry or whatever they want to do. We want to make sure that providers of education are fair dinkum about providing that degree and that students do not pay their dollars for something that will not give them the qualifications or the recognition domestically and internationally.

With the growth in the international education sector, sadly, have come some immoral and unethical practices. We have seen that, and it is recognised throughout the community and the country. We want to ensure that those people involved have good regulation and that those who participate and work in the sector will work for ethical and moral institutions.

A perfect example of the contribution of this federal Labor government and the commitment to TAFE in my community is the $2 million that we have put in for capital infrastructure in our area. It is a perfect example of being hand-in-glove with good regulation and more money—you cannot have one without the other. The good regulation in this legislation comes with increased funding in the budget and in what we have seen in terms of on-the-ground assistance to TAFE. For example, the machinery shop which trains workers and apprentices in mechanical engineering and manufacturing in my home city of Ipswich at the Bremer Institute of TAFE has been improved dramatically by our additional funding. That is an institution governed by the regulatory framework that we have talked about in this legislation. That institute, based in Bundamba in my electorate, has over 15,000 students enrolled in the Western Corridor from Brisbane to Ipswich and beyond. It has a student satisfaction rating of 89 per cent, which is pretty high, and employment outcomes for graduates of the Bremer Institute of TAFE are 74 per cent. That is a good outcome, because not every degree, diploma or qualification is geared towards employment outcomes. Some of these courses are in English as a second language, and some are about enhancing people's capacities or improving their self-esteem, as well as other types of courses which do eventually lead to employment.

It is a publicly owned entity, it is government backed, it offers stability and continuity, it has been there for about 100 years and there are rewards after rewards that people can have by attending there. There are also awards and awards that that institution has received. The institution has helped people in my area and it has helped businesses in the Ipswich and West Moreton region to achieve their potential. It is based in Ipswich in South-East Queensland and is registered to deliver over 250 programs from Certificate I to associate diploma level. That is a good institution. It is tried and true. For 100 years it has been operating, and I think that is a fantastic testimony to a body that is enhanced by capital infrastructure and good oversight. We have heard members opposite and I heard the previous speaker talking about assistance to regional and rural students. I have an electorate that is based on Ipswich in the Somerset region and we have many students who travel from country areas to Ipswich.

It is worth millions of dollars to the Lockyer Valley. The coalition never did it. They did not have the wit or wisdom to do it. It took a federal Labor government to do it in a regional and rural area in South-East Queensland. So we have got record investments in higher education.

Let me give you a couple of facts. I feel compelled to stand up for the local universities in my area and the local students and put a few facts on the table. It is a fact that we have had 837 local students receiving the Student Start-up Scholarship. We have also had relocation scholarship payments provided to 138 local students. We have had 625 young people benefit from the changes that we made to qualification for assistance for regional and rural students to get to university. Six hundred and twenty-five young people have benefited from the changes by now receiving the maximum payment of youth allowance, or a higher rate of youth allowance, or even a payment of youth allowance for the first time. Investment in regional universities has also increased with the government funding 10 per cent more student places since 2009.

This is the latest analysis from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, and it was released on 1 June 2011. In just 12 months, the number of inner regional students receiving the youth allowance payment has risen by 4,250, an increase of 20 per cent. During the same period, the number of outer regional and remote students receiving youth allowance has risen by 2,150, an increase of 27 per cent. So the latest analysis confirms that this federal Labor government is delivering more support than ever before to regional students to go to university, and we remain committed to removing regional eligibility distinctions for the youth allowance from 1 January next year, and continue to support regional universities. As a result of our reforms, each year regional university students receive youth allowance and a paid-up scholarship worth $2,194, and the Labor government did that in 2011. Dependent students who move away from home to study typically receive more than $6,000 during a three-year degree to assist in relocation. We reversed the decline in regional university enrolments. We have made a record investment in regional universities and we have provided more financial support to rural and regional students than ever before.

I have seen press releases and reports in regional newspapers, and I have got 12 newspapers that cover my seat in regional and rural areas so I see the press releases and I see the nonsense that they say. Country students need support to go to university and we have provided more than ever before. The independent umpire has given the verdict. What we have said has come true. We have provided more funding to regional universities, more funding to regional students and more assistance.

I am determined that this sector be supported and given all of the assistance that it possibly can be given. Quality education and research are crucial to our nation and our people's success in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. All Australians should be encouraged to pursue higher education and be supported in their endeavour to do so. That is why I support this legislation and will ensure that quality providers apply for and are able to offer those very important income contingent loans in the form of

The vocational education and training system provides students with the practical skills and knowledge that they need to go into the labour force initially and re-enter the labour force, either by retraining for a new job or upgrading their skills for an existing job. Since the 1990s, government policies have supported the development of a very competitive market in VET provision and today VET is provided through a national framework of many thousands of public and private registered training providers. I want to acknowledge the work that the VET providers do for state and territory governments. They run institutes of technical and further education and other government providers—for example, in the university VET campuses, agricultural colleges, community based providers, private providers, enterprises and also in the great work that some secondary schools do in this area.

We need to make sure that all of our independent providers of post-compulsory education and training are supported, and I thank them both for the incredible leadership that they provide in this particular area.

The course scholarships were made available through the generosity of ACPET, the member colleges and the institutions and they have been made available since 2009 in response to the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires.

Scholarships were awarded on demonstrated financial need, technical ability and interest in the nominated course of study. Those interested, particularly if they are wanting to take advantage of these scholarships, should also contact my Brisbane office. I want to pay tribute to the sector for bringing up those scholarships at a time of great need.

Because of these risks, we need to be satisfied that our safeguards and mechanisms for provider approval are robust, and to my mind the bill the government has presented achieves this though the fit and proper persons test.

Enrolment growth has been slightly at less than an average of one per cent a year in the last five years and apprenticeship completion rates are not satisfactory. Public confidence in the quality of provision has been shaken by improper activities in the delivery of programs, particularly to international students. We have some challenges before us and we have areas that need to be corrected and improved upon, but the future does look bright. With better provider approval processes it will certainly increase the number of students accessing fee assistance, and the coalition are very supportive of this measure. At a time when all Australians are facing very tough economic realities, including increases in groceries, utilities, rents and mortgages, any assistance that we can provide to those who really need fee assistance and help in accessing it is very welcome.

It could be argued, as it is with higher education, that there are private rates of return to VET that make student charges justifiable. Consequently, VET students should have access to income contingent loans because upfront fees may be acting as a terrible barrier for them to pursue VET participation.

Expectations were that, with the introduction of FEE-HELP, there would be an increase in the uptake of full-fee places. This was introduced by the coalition government, of which I was a part. Under the reforms in 2007 extended student assistance was provided to those studying at diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma levels, just as the requirements are with the

The requirement was for students to repay the loan once their income exceeded a minimum repayment, currently just under $45,000 per annum. Unfortunately there are far too few Australians who have been able to access VET FEE-HELP to date. Departmental figures show that, in 2009, only 5,262 students received income contingent loans under this scheme. It is understandable, I suppose, as there are only 50 registered training organisations eligible to provide VET FEE-HELP.

Predictions are that there will be labour shortfalls in these areas if current levels of supply of qualifications are maintained. Therefore, by providing students with financial support needed to undertake studies at this level, VET FEE-HELP can potentially help finance this demand. That is why I am very happy to support this bill. Every day in my electorate of Brisbane people tell me of the very great difficulty they face in sourcing and retaining appropriately qualified and experienced staff. Indeed, from my own experience as a small business operator I can attest to the trials of negotiating the human resources merry-go-round that exists out there. That is why we need to do so much better in this area. I am committed to ensuring that all Australians have access to quality training to make sure that they have the real world skills needed. This commitment goes hand in glove with the coalition's long-held goal to ensure that all Australians who want a job can get a job.

What is a tragedy, today, is that 40,000 people aged 15 to 17 years of age—that is nearly five per cent—are not in education, training or work. And nearly one quarter of people aged 15 to 19 are currently looking for full-time work. We really need to do much better. It is a function of many variables, notably major demographic changes and the ageing of the population, but it is also partly due to a shrinking pool of skilled-up job seekers available to take up job opportunities and it is certainly a function of the government's failure. The skills shortage is of great concern to me and my coalition colleagues. I recommit myself to ensuring all I can do as the member for Brisbane to help businesses struggling to find staff with the skills that they need. We need workers in Australia to have better skills and to utilise them more effectively in workplaces and businesses. The VET sector provides that certainty and particular support, and we should all work towards that aim. I support this bill and I hope that more students will take advantage of the VET FEE-HELP scheme.

Ms Gambaro would remember back in her earlier parliamentary incarnation as the member for Petrie in 1996 that one of the key priorities of the Howard coalition government was to restore public confidence and commitment to vocational education and training. At the end of the Hawke-Keating era of Labor governments there was the Dawkins review and the rhetoric about the way funding was allocated. Vocational qualifications had been very much relegated to being second-class qualifications. All that the former Labor government could talk about were university degrees, as if those were the only postsecondary education pathway that people could consider.

There were innovations in apprenticeships by broadening the base of those qualifications beyond the traditional trades. What a renaissance that was in vocational education and training under the Howard government. I am pleased that that leadership has caught on. It seems to have infected the newer Labor government and it is pleasing to see that this Labor government is turning its mind to issues that seemed all too tedious for the last Labor government in Canberra.

This is a good thing because it is a clear statement that we have no place for those who think they can offer courses, particularly to overseas students, in the guise of education for what are really shopfronts for visa factories. These diminish the quality of education in Australia.

The minister also has a power in this legislation that can be exercised by regulation to establish criteria for deciding whether the management of a registered training provider meet the fit and proper persons test. So there will be more activity to tease out precisely what that means to ensure that people are eligible to be approved as higher education providers or VET providers. I have touched on the introduction of the contingent loans for the vocational education training sector—a measure from the Howard government years and one that has been carried forward by this bill. This is a good measure because a number of people do feel that the cost of pursuing a vocational education qualification or a higher education course is a barrier to their participation. Here we see an income-contingent loan that would take into account all or part of the student tuition fees. This is important because that income-contingent loan in this financial year only begins to be repaid when the eligible person has an income in the order of—as I look quickly through my notes—the mid-$40,000s, if I recall correctly. That is a point in time where the financial benefits of those that have achieved a qualification are starting to be realised—it is $44,911 for 2011—and it recognises that, as the taxpayer and the broader community make a contribution through government and institutions and providers of vocational education and higher education, the individual who is benefiting from that investment also receives a personal benefit.

Some of the figures that have been available through the department communicate that in 2009 only a little over 5,000 students received income-contingent loans under the VET FEE-HELP scheme and only 50 registered training organisations were eligible.

Aspiration is as crucial as having access to the finances to pursue post-secondary education. In the community that I represent, where we have half the representation of our young people in post-secondary education compared to the Melbourne average, there are other issues at play. One of them is to get the message clearly, strongly and consistently across to all young people that their postcode does not determine their potential and that the delicious possibilities available in post-secondary education could well be theirs, and we have a task not only to make sure that financial barriers are removed but that aspiration for post-secondary education is a belief and commitment that all young people share. It is also a pathway in which we need to invest.

We recognise the absolute value that is added to the Australian economy as a consequence of Australians and others undertaking additional tertiary study. Whether that tertiary study is at a vocational level or at a tertiary institution like a university, the reality is that it is a way for people to invest in their human capital, ensuring that that investment in themselves, in their children—it may, in fact, be in their grandchildren—actually reaps rewards for the broader community as well. There is power through knowledge, and the former coalition and I are strongly committed to knowledge in the form of additional education. In that sense, that was the precursor to additional support that was offered through the FEE-HELP program.

It ensures that, where there are fit and proper people, they are able to offer their students income contingent loans. In that sense, this is enabling legislation.

Financially, for many people it would seem to be, in some respects, a decision between their ability to live and their ability to undertake further study. That is not a choice that should have to be made. So, in that sense, this bill and its operation to extend VET FEE-HELP is a welcome addition, because it ensures that, where possible and where appropriate, the government recognises the public benefit that flows from increased education across the community and offers a helping hand. Of course, one of the primary functions of federal government is to offer that helping hand where obvious public dividends flow from it. In that sense, this is a bill that certainly moves a long way towards making sure that the public broadly is able to enjoy the benefits and the dividends that flow from a more educated populace.

The loans, as they would function as a consequence of this bill, may cover or partially cover tuition costs for the VET course. Students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds a minimum payment level of $44,911 for the financial year.

As long ago as 12 months but more recently as well, we have seen some examples, especially where they relate to international students, of some education providers perhaps not meeting the character test. The inclusion of this test is a step forward because it does recognise that quality providers should be able to provide income-contingent loans on behalf of taxpayers to those who meet the criteria, in terms of both the RTO in question and those students that might benefit from that education.

This is inexorably linked to the issue of vocational education and training. That is because, for those international students who have decided to undertake VET training—for example, have decided to undertake an English language course in Australia—ready access to the department—in particular, over-the-counter services of the department—are crucial to their undertaking their studies in Australia.

That has now all been put in jeopardy. Actually, it is going to be axed as a consequence of the decision of this Labor government. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will no longer exist in Southport, and is in fact now going to be transferred to Brisbane. So, at the one point where this bill does take some concrete steps towards improving VET outcomes for those who undertake additional study, the government is also unfortunately withdrawing from Australia's sixth-largest city this crucial service through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. This is going to materially and directly affect those international students who choose to undertake VET study on the Gold Coast. It is a massive step backwards, and it demonstrates that this is a government that is now seeking to recover costs wherever it can as a direct consequence of its reckless spending and the fact that it is borrowing $135 million a day. Now, of course, it desperately needs to try to recover costs in some way, and that means the withdrawal of government services from a city of 500,000 people.

I would hope that the result of this legislation will be that there are young Australians who today think that they cannot afford to undertake VET training or additional VET study who will now recognise that, should they qualify, they will be provided assistance by taxpayers to undertake further study. That is absolutely a good step forward for them. It is absolutely going to pay dividends to the community. We know that those with additional educational qualifications are generally less likely to become unemployed and, when they are unemployed, are less likely to be unemployed for a longer period of time—that is, those who have a better level of education generally tend to be unemployed for shorter periods of time. Both of those measures are an investment in the future of Australia as well as an investment in those particular individuals themselves. I will confine my comments to these.

At the outset, I would like to thank the minister and his office, particularly Mr Tim Friedrich, for listening and for fixing an unintended consequence of changes that were made to the legislation in 2007, I think. The particular amendment that I would like to talk about is the more flexible 'principal purpose' requirement which has enabled a training provider in my electorate to continue to operate. It is a business that offers training and should continue to operate.

The airline does a lot of other mining routes as well. It is fantastic to see a regional business such as this expand, but one of the things that occurred during this expansion was that the provision of services along these routes took over and became a growing part of the business. Sharp still continues to provide excellent training for trainee pilots, but the principal purpose of the organisation became the delivery of air services.

Following that, Helen Sobey from Sharp Airlines came up for a meeting with Tim Friedrich, the minister and others. The minister, his office and the department listened to the case that was put forward and, hence, we have this more flexible 'principal purpose' requirement in the bill. I would like to place on record my appreciation for this being included in the bill. If it had not been included, there was a possibility that Sharp Airlines may have reluctantly had to look at relocating in order to get access to VET FEE-HELP. That would have been a real shame not only for Hamilton but also for the family business itself.

I think the lesson for all of us as decision makers in this building is that when we legislate we should always think of the unintended consequences. When we put forward laws from Canberra we should especially realise that what may be suitable for training providers in our big urban centres or capital cities may not always fit with what is happening on the ground in regional and rural areas. I think for that reason we have to be very careful about mandating absolutely specific requirements. We should always be prepared to say that we might need particular flexibility. So it gives me great pleasure to see that in this bill that is what has been provided. I know that Sharp Airlines are very appreciative that the minister has gone down this path. They feel that they have been listened to in this circumstance. That is very good and they are grateful.

The amendment adds to the current principal purpose provisions to allow the minister the discretion to approve a body corporate as a higher education or VET provider where the principal purpose of that body may not be education—and/or research in the case of higher education providers—as long as its other purpose or purposes do not conflict with its principal purpose. The minister may suspend or revoke a body's approval as a higher education or VET provider if any of the body's other purposes conflict with its principal purpose, or if the body no longer has education—and/or research, in the case of higher education providers—as its principal purpose.

Once again, I think the government has acted in good faith in making this amendment. As the member for Wannon, as a member of the coalition and as someone who led a delegation to the minister, I support this change.

The intention is to simplify administrative arrangements relating to VET providers to ensure that quality providers apply for and are able to offer income-contingent loans in the form of VET FEE-HELP. The bill also seeks to improve risk management processes ensuring VET FEE-HELP approved providers are fit and proper people. I think we are all in agreement that we need this to be the case and that we do not want to see an instance or instances whereby some of those who are providing VET training may not be doing so for particularly wholesome reasons. So this is a good change.

I go back to one of the amendments which have been made which will enable young potential pilots from around Australia to go and train in Hamilton to become pilots and get assistance for doing so, whereas under the previous legislation that was not the case; only those that had the income could do so. This is a change for the better.

It is good to see that both sides have been able, in government, to continue to progress the changes which were made to the sector in 2007—changes led by the coalition government at that time. The extension of student loan assistance from the university sector to the VET sector with student loans available for diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses, was a very positive move. It was recognition that, while we need students in our tertiary institutions, in our universities, we also need to ensure that students who want to do, for instance, aviation training are able to afford to do so and to be able to relocate where necessary to do that training. The loan may cover or partially cover the tuition costs of the VET course, a sensible addition, and students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level of $44,911 for 2011—once again, a very sensible provision.

It is important, as I stated before, that we can position students, no matter how they are seeking to skill themselves—whether it be in universities or through vocational education or training—so that they can afford to do so. So hopefully we will now see greater access to this. One place where I am sure it will happen is that we will see an increase in the aviation sector.

These are the most available figures at the moment, but hopefully we will see that number increase significantly. There were only 15 registered training organisations that were eligible. Once again, I think that through these amendments, and in particular the one that I detailed specifically earlier in my speech, we will see the number of

Once again, I think this is a sensible addition. It is another safeguard to make sure that the VET provider wants to provide education and training in the vocational sector—that that is what their intent is.

Once again I express my appreciation that we will now see this being able to be offered to students who seek to learn how to fly. As our need for air services continues to grow, with the expansion especially in our resource sector, and the needs of our commercial airlines continue to grow, we are going to need to continue to process pilots and to be able to train them up. The changes in this bill will enable that to happen. I think that on the whole everyone in this House will finally benefit from that change, because a dearth and shortage of pilots is not something that the nation needs. We need to be doing everything we can to encourage aviation training. Once again I would like to place on the record my thanks to the minister and his office for having listened, for having made the amendment that they have made in this bill and also for following on from the good work that the Howard government did in introducing this VET FEE-HELP.

Those workforce skills are needed to support not only the resource sector but also the front-line companies and businesses, including the public sector, which provide services to it. What I appreciated from the discussion is the rich thinking and depth of thinking that has occurred among the RTOs. Certainly all of them expressed the need to have some flexibility in the way they attract students in what they see as a continuum, a lifelong journey—so age was not a factor from their perspective.

Out of those discussions has evolved a tremendous agreement that they want to be leaders in the work within the electorate to provide opportunities for training, for educational pathways. But they also looked at the question: how do they link with all the institutions that this act covers in an effective way of ensuring the points are a connection into the lifelong learning pathways and the skilling pathways required? Some innovative thinking has arisen in that group.

There are some challenges for us in the way we have to think—we have to think outside the square. We cannot always make assumptions that the current training we provide will meet tomorrow's future. In this sense, I often look at this sector and wonder whether we are teaching our young people, the future of our nation, with yesterday's curriculum and with today's teaching staff. These are some of the challenges that we have to think about and this bill provides for that. We need to look at the universal pathways that need to be joined together in the complexity of the provision of training and education, but we also need to think outside the square. And I do like, as I said, the provision of flexibility in the recognition of bodies corporate as higher education or VET providers in the 'principal purpose' requirement. I think that gives tremendous capacity to providers to look at the future, to look at 2030, and say, 'What is it that we really need to start thinking about in the way in which we skill the workforce?'

The other aspect we have to build into that is capacity building for the future. I want tertiary education to be a factor that is important in the lives of all Australians, so that at different points in their career they can turn to the right training organisation and seek to gain qualifications, skills and knowledge that they can apply in the pathways they are following. I honestly believe that by 2030 we will be part of a global society, a global world, a global economy, in which the transferability of skills will be universal. I like the fact that this bill is encapsulating that possibility. I compliment the government for bringing forward these amendments to the act. Sometimes we need to take stock and look at what the inhibitors and barriers are and then work to remove them collaboratively. That is why the coalition, those of us on this side, support this bill—it does provide that possibility.

That is critical if we are going to develop the capacity of our future nation. I also believe that the intent to provide the Commonwealth with a better process to manage provider risk, with a subsequent increase in provider approvals, will lead to a rise in students accessing both fees. That augurs well for the future. It gives our training providers added capacity and gives industry some assurance that the providers that they engage with or have their young people skilled through are providing standards that the industry is looking for.

I talked to a couple of lecturers, and they really appreciate that skills they acquired within the industry can now be taught through technology that was not around when they went through their training—for example, the use of simulators that enable young people, or even those returning for second chance education, to better hone their skills to the levels required. If this bill gives that latitude and that flexibility to those who govern these institutions, then again I want to acknowledge that that is a highly beneficial aspect of the bill.

The access to the fees help that is available is tremendous. Income contingent loans were extended to the VET sector in 2007, and that was a tremendous move in building the opportunity for developing capacity. These programs provide a loan, for all or part of the student's tuition costs, which has to be repaid once the student exceeds a set level of income. These programs accord access to anybody meeting the criteria, and students then have the opportunity to undertake a training program that meets their needs and that also makes them competitive in the talent pool.

To that end, the simplification of the administrative requirements, in delivering efficiencies to both providers and the Commonwealth and improving the Commonwealth's ability to manage provider risk and increase the rate of provider approval, increases the number of students able to access income contingent loans through quality providers in both the higher education and VET sectors.

This bill gives training and higher education providers an opportunity to respond flexibly to the future and deliver the courses required to skill all Australians.

VET FEE-HELP provides a loan for all or part of a student's tuition costs. As such, it provides assistance and an incentive to students who may not have taken up further higher education and higher level skill qualifications to do so by reducing the financial barriers to those studies. VET FEE-HELP is a contingent loan scheme for the VET sector and it is part of the higher education loan program. Currently, there are approximately 90 VET providers that have been approved under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to offer VET FEE-HELP to eligible students.

In addition, the administrative requirements are intended to be simplified to improve the Commonwealth's ability to manage provider risk. It is essential that there is a proper approval process to ensure that education providers maintain appropriate standards and conduct themselves in an ethical manner. With an expected increase in providers, this will be an issue that will need to be properly managed by the government. The risk of undesirable providers entering the market is intended, though this bill, to be managed in part through the introduction of a fit and proper person test for the management decision makers of these bodies. This bill also provides flexibility in the principal purpose requirement for the recognition of bodies corporate as a higher education or VET provider but does not, however, specify how this requirement will be met.

This scheme was established to provide opportunities for more Australians to pursue new careers or lift their qualifications without facing the financial burden of having to pay upfront tuition fees. In 2009, a total of 5,262 students accessed VET FEE-HELP assistance, including 890 students from low socioeconomic areas. The VET FEE-HELP statistical report claimed the majority of assisted students were female and half were under 25 years of age. Younger students do not generally have the finances to be able to pay their tuition fees upfront. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that our young people are taking advantage of being able to study certificate and diploma level courses with part or full income contingent loans. The most common qualification being attained by these students is the Diploma of Accounting. Around 79 per cent of VET FEE-HELP students are applying themselves to the diploma level of study, with the remaining opting for certificate level programs.

The most common field of education in 2009 for VET FEE-HELP assisted students was society and culture, undertaken by 1,382 students. Most of these students were enrolled in the Diploma of Children's Services. The second most common education field was management and commerce. It was undertaken by 1,338 students, so it was a very close second.

Successful graduates can work as endorsed enrolled nurses in private and public hospitals, aged-care facilities, hostels or medical centres—all of which are high-demand positions on the Gold Coast. It allows successful students the ability to be employed in various healthcare environments around the country. There are currently discussions underway in relation to formal training for surf craft manufacturing with a view to developing an apprenticeship. We are hoping that this will be based in the Gold Coast. During the lead-up to the 2010 federal election the coalition promised $500,000 to develop appropriate training for surfboard manufacturers and board shapers. This was not matched by Labor; however, the need for formal qualifications in this industry sector remains and must be addressed as a priority. To date the Gold Coast TAFE has shown a keen interest in supporting this industry and the Coolangatta campus is a viable option for training delivery.

In addition to nursing, it offers a Diploma of Accounting and a Diploma of Community Services Work. The progressive action of King's since 1996 has allowed the college to update and expand its programs in growth areas by offering training that is practical, workplace relevant and meets current statutory requirements. The Gold Coast TAFE and the King's International College are just two examples, but there are many others on the Gold Coast. We need to ensure that students are able to access training and gain these qualifications to fill the need for skilled staff in the industries that require them the most. The VET FEE-HELP income contingent loans encourage students to undertake these studies and gain employment in their chosen fields without an unnecessary financial burden at a time when they can least afford to pay.

I believe that it is fair to say that the Gold Coast is well on the way to becoming an education city. In my electorate of McPherson on the southern Gold Coast, in addition to the TAFEs and privately operated training colleges, including those registered training organisations that are already recognised VET FEE-HELP providers, we have two universities.

However, the Gold Coast is a region with low higher education participation rates, as illustrated by the data from the 2006 census, where only 18 per cent of the Gold Coast population aged 25 to 34 were degree qualified compared to the national average of 29 per cent. Considerable work needs to be done to meet the Bradley review target of a future skilled workforce where 40 per cent of Australians between the ages of 25 to 34 will hold a bachelor's degree by 2025.

When Bond University opened 21 years ago it was the first private university in Australia and it was modelled on the traditions of the world's most elite educational institutions. Bond has produced some 16,000 graduates since its establishment and this has been achieved with minimal public funding, as more than 90 per cent of the university's total income is derived from student fees. In 2010 Bond University had an average of 4,365 students on campus, made up of approximately 66 per cent Australian students and 34 per cent international students.

A total of 10 per cent of the revenue is redirected to fee scholarships, and a range of corporate and foundation funded scholarships are being developed in addition to this. These scholarships are merit based and therefore support access and equity to students who might otherwise not be able to afford a place by helping them gain admittance on the basis of merit. Bond University places are not subsidised by the government and full tuition fees are charged semesterly on a subject-by-subject basis. Without access to FEE-HELP students wishing to undertake study at Bond are required to obtain personal finance or sponsorship programs. Bond University prides itself on being a not-for-profit organisation. Tuition fees are re-invested back into the university enabling Bond to offer world-class campus facilities, state-of-the-art learning resources, a lower student-to-staff ratio and access to Australia's leading academics and corporate achievers. FEE-HELP makes private education like at Bond University more accessible than ever, encouraging quality access to higher education for all Australians.

Bond University is also saying that the difference between the tuition cost and the Commonwealth supported places funding should be the student contribution, which could be funded through FEE-HELP. I support this view, and I support this view very strongly as a way forward.

I think all of us realise that our youth are our country's future and that education gives young people the best opportunity of getting a good job and making a contribution to society. It is therefore vital that youth right around Australia are encouraged as much as possible to take advantage of the many educational opportunities available to them in this country, and that the education they seek and receive suits them in the direction in which they hope to travel during their working life. It is, of course, good for them and it is good for the community when our young people achieve a good education.

Also they need financial support through loans from the government, and that is the subject matter of the Higher Education Support Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2011.

I think society is becoming increasingly complicated and, while there are more choices and opportunities for young people than previously existed, I suspect that society also poses many challenges that were not confronting young people of earlier eras. The cost of education—and parents would know this all too well—can often feel like a bottomless pit for students as well as for their families. Not only do students often have to pay the cost of tuition; they also have the cost of textbooks and other equipment directly utilised in their education such as calculators and, if someone wants to be a carpenter, then hammers and drills, or aprons and kitchen utensils for chefs, and all other sorts of tools of the trade that are specific to the various courses in which students are enrolled.

All of these costs mount up and it is important that a society provides as much assistance as it reasonably can to benefit students because it is an investment in the future. Properly educated students mean a properly educated workforce and that, of course, means that we are a society which is much better able to compete in the world of the 21st century. In the past, financial assistance has come through programs such as Austudy for tertiary students and many in this country have benefited from that support and gone on to have successful, busy and rewarding careers. It was a sensible, successful move by the former Liberal-National Party government to recognise that not everyone is destined for a career that requires tertiary studies and that those who do not wish to undertake studies through university should have equal access to financial support as they go through obtaining their educational qualifications. It is relevant to state that too many times in our community parents have stressed that it is important for students to get a university degree—any university degree—even one that might not lead to many career opportunities. We have undervalued trade training and we have undervalued encouraging young people to undertake technical education. But through the initiative of the previous Liberal-National Party government, the

This is an indexed figure as at 2011, so this year. This ensures that the loan used to acquire improved qualifications does not become a burdensome bill but one that has a delayed repayment trigger that comes into play only when the graduated student is able to afford repayments. These loans now extend beyond support for university courses, to make loans available for diploma and advanced diploma courses, as well as graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses.

I think that as an equity measure you would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it is important that remoteness or extreme distance from a tertiary or vocational training centre ought not to be a determining factor as to whether a young person is able to undertake the necessary education. Those who live in rural areas, as opposed to those who live in the cities, should not be disadvantaged in the pursuit of the training, the study and the jobs that they wish to pursue.

I know the minister is very well intentioned in this area and I can see her nodding at my suggestion.

The changes afforded by this bill intend to introduce a number of modifications to the act that help to simplify the administrative arrangements for the providers of VET courses and also to improve the risk management processes associated with identifying and monitoring VET providers to ensure that the providers are 'fit and proper' to provide the tuition to an acceptable and professional standard. I must say that I was surprised to see that only 50 VET providers had previously been approved, and part of the aim of this bill is to increase flexibility. This is very positive.

The changes have as their fundamental purpose the support of young people and boosting the availability of skilled workers in Australia. Unfortunately the latest figures from 2009 from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations show that only 5,262 students were assisted in this program and that there were, as I said a moment ago, only 50 registered training organisations. So access to services in this important and valuable sector is lacking and needs to be improved.

I was privileged to be present, and Senator Claire Moore was there representing the government, at the opening of this important trade training centre. It is a centre that gives instruction to students from high schools in pursuits that are important for a coastal area that is so dependent on construction. It will again rely even more on construction as the pressures of the global financial crisis submerge and as the economy is restored. The courses on offer were not available when many people were going through high school—building and construction, civil engineering and sustainable energy. The programs at the trade training centre are delivered by a partnership between the Sunshine Coast Institute of TAFE and the University of the Sunshine Coast. The building has a wonderful design and it is a credit to all of those who are involved. It is already providing a wonderful opportunity for young people as it enables them to commence developing their skills in preparation for their life after school while they are still at school.

The fact that these four schools are working together probably made their application so attractive. The centre provides an alternative school-based pathway for learning and is a sensible community asset that provides students with a practical educational initiative. Some 60 students from year 11 are enrolled at the centre presently, and of course this figure will increase over coming years. I commend all those involved in the centre and also the students. I have to say they looked particularly smart in their uniforms and work boots during the official opening, but they did begin to shiver towards the end of the ceremony as the main work area, with its high ceilings and cement floors, was not exactly the warmest place on the Sunshine Coast on that particular day.

It is a good bill, a commendable bill, and I thank the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare for introducing it. It is a bill that seeks to streamline measures in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. It is important to encourage young people, and supporting this bill is another opportunity to do that.

But I cannot honour him as those who knew him and loved him honour him. I cannot share with you, with this House, some personal insight into this brave young man. What I can do is to thank him on behalf of so many Australians, because this brave young man went to war at his nation's request—at our request—not once but on two separate deployments. Rowan Robinson died fighting for Australia, for all of us. Not for him is the opportunity for the debate and discussions we have in this place—the debate and discussions we have because of the bravery of so many young Australians in Afghanistan and those who have gone before. It was simply an order, a deployment, an operation and a duty proudly undertaken. His family's statement said:

And yet that is what we ask of our troops each time they go to war, each mission, each patrol and each action. That is what we must never forget. These brave young men undertake these risks and sadly, many die—sadly, too many die. They take these risks because their nation asks them to. As I said some time ago, sadly, the remoteness of this war and the 15-second grab nature of television news means that many Australians do not see the harsh reality of war. They do not feel the pain and suffering of those who have lost a son, a brother, a friend.

There is little I can say that can take away the pain of your tragic loss. Your nation is forever in your debt because, like Rowan, you have paid the greatest price. You have lost someone you love—as simple, as harsh and as tragic as that. We must never forget that debt. To Rowan Robinson, I did not know you but in this place I honour you as I honour those who have gone before and those who are still there. I can only imagine the pain and suffering of your family. My heart is with them.

To ensure these great warriors and their fallen comrades did not die in vain we must remain committed to our obligations in Afghanistan. We must remain committed to the troops still serving and we must not let the Taliban think they have won by showing any signs of considering a withdrawal. Fighting season, the Taliban-led spring offensive in Afghanistan, has not long started. To leave now would signal to them they have won. But they have not won and they will not—not now, not tomorrow, not into the future. There must be no safe haven for terrorism, no training camps for terrorists, no more 9-11s, no more Bali or London bombings.

It was called the war to end all wars, but we know that war continues to this day. Sadly, while ever evildoers threatened to rise up and do evil things to innocent people, stopping these bad and mad people from future acts of atrocity must and will be a priority of those nations such as Australia which are prepared to have their best and bravest fight and, if necessary, die in the pursuit of peace. My World War I posters of valour are poignant reminders of the ultimate price paid by the 59,341 diggers so that we can stand here in our democratic parliament, in a democratic country, and voice our opinions freely. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

It was during March-April last year that I had the opportunity to go to Afghanistan. I did not know Sapper Robinson, Lieutenant Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Wood, Sapper Larcombe or Corporal Atkinson and I had not met them, but I feel I had because I had met their colleagues, the people from the same units, the people these brave heroes served alongside. While I did not know them individually, I knew them because of what they were, who they were and how they served their nation with great distinction. We can never forget their sacrifice.

They would never expect their mates to do the heavy lifting for them. Their creed is that they do the heavy lifting for their mates. They never, ever leave anyone behind or in a position of danger. And that can be said of these fallen heroes. Other speakers have detailed their tours of duty and their well-earned, well-deserved medals of recognition for the campaigns that they have fought. But, simply said: how do you fill the hole that is left in the lives of their family and their friends? It is that hole that makes sure that they are remembered.

That must play hard on our minds because we should never forget their service or their sacrifice in Afghanistan not just fighting for the freedoms and ideals of the people in Australia and to reduce the opportunity for terrorism, but fighting for people they do not know, so that those young boys and girls in Afghanistan can have the freedoms, the democracy and the opportunities that we sometimes take for granted in Australia. This is a war fought in a foreign land against an evil that knows no bounds and no rules, but these diggers step up to the plate.

If they had kids, they were there fighting for their kids' future. What they saw in the kids of Afghanistan was a reflection of their own children. They saw sense, they saw hope and they saw a future. They wanted the children in Afghanistan to grow up with the opportunities and freedoms that they ask for their own children.

They are not forced to go to war; they volunteer to go to war. In fact, some of them fight and train very hard to qualify to go and do what they do. Quite often, people divide up the recognition and the allocation of heroism for people who serve in various positions in the theatres of operation.

We have paid enough of a price but if, indeed, more is to be paid to make sure the job is completed then that is the way it is. All of their families, of course, are devastated and saddened by their loss but the families that I have met with at the various ramp ceremonies and funerals for our diggers that I have attended, each to a T, has said, 'Please don't let their sacrifice be in vain.' They want the job completed because they understand the ideals that these fine Australian men gave their lives for and that must always be remembered. So I simply say as I honour these fine Australian heroes: lest we forget.

His loss is felt across this country but more so, obviously, by his mother and father, Marie and Peter, sister Rachael and two brothers, Ben and Troy. Words alone cannot express the heartfelt sorrow that we feel when one so young and full of life is taken from us. But it is with more than words that we reach out to those closest to Rowan. We also reach out with our thoughts, our prayers, our sympathy and our gratitude. We offer gratitude for the life, the joy, the mateship and the service that Rowan Robinson offered to those around him—to his family, his friends, his colleagues and his country.

They discovered a large stash of weapons, including grenade launchers, ammo, assault rifles and communication equipment, and during that raid the patrol was shot at. The patrol destroyed the stash and moved on to another area where they again came under heavy fire from several directions, and this is where Sapper Rowan Robinson was tragically taken from us. I mention this only to say that Sapper Robinson died while saving lives. Every gun, rifle and grenade launcher in that stash, every bit of ammo and other equipment that was destroyed by Sapper Robinson and the rest of the patrol could very well mean that a coalition soldier or an Afghan national is not killed now and into the future. That is bravery, to lay down one's life for his friend, the friends in this case being his brothers in arms and our friends in Afghanistan who dream of a free and peaceful nation.

Sapper Robinson died fighting with his mates in a mission that will save lives, earning the respect of fellow soldiers, officers and those here at home. Words alone cannot console, but I want to put on record my gratitude and respect for the life of Sapper Rowan Robinson and for his service to this country. I am sure that the entire electorate of Dawson joins with me in expressing sadness at the news of his passing.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Sapper Robinson's family at this time of grieving and also with all the families of our servicemen who have fallen in conflict in Afghanistan. I want to finish with St Ignatius' prayer. It reads:

These were young men who had so much to live for. These young men sacrificed their lives for Australia's cause in Afghanistan. It is our duty to accord them the highest honour.

The news of these deaths has shocked and distressed millions of Australians. As we come to terms with 27 operational deaths in Afghanistan, our thoughts are with the families, friends and fellow soldiers who daily bear the burden of their sacrifice. For them, there will be moments of overwhelming grief and a permanent feeling of emptiness. There is no way for us to comprehend what they are going through. This is the serious price we pay for our involvement in the fight for freedom and security, and we must never forget it.

It is not only natural but important that we continue to view our involvement in Afghanistan with a critical mind. So long as our troops remain overseas there will be moments of great sadness in Australia and in this parliament. It is at times like these that we must look to the objectives of our primary mission to defeat terrorists. To do this we need to train Afghan security forces so that they can provide for their own security. Our mission is also to honour and protect the US alliance, which is in our national interest. Our national security is in our national interest.

Looking to our efforts in Afghanistan, we can be proud of what we have accomplished thus far. We have made it a safer country. We have given opportunity to thousands of men, women and children who lived in fear under the Taliban. Together with the local people, we have put in place governance, security and education structures to ensure that the country will not again be used as a breeding ground for international terrorism.

More than anyone else, our leaders in the Defence Force wish to preserve the lives of our troops in combat. They know the situation that confronts our soldiers every day, and they know best how to respond. We should respect their judgment. We should listen to Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who said:

Australia has played a key role in disrupting terrorist activities and breaking the stranglehold of the religious zealots who have kept the population of Afghanistan in fear for so long. We have helped rebuild a functional society where people have the ultimate say in who leads their country. We have helped put an end to much of the violence and suffering. It has been the efforts of soldiers like Brett Wood, Marcus Case, Andrew Jones and Rowan Robinson that have made Afghanistan a freer place for everyone, and particularly for women. We have forged an important friendship with the people of Afghanistan, who want to be a free people and need us there to help them build a free and democratic nation.

We must bear in mind their great sacrifices and ensure that what they have fought to achieve is protected and fostered. The best way to do that is by growing the substantial gains we have already made in Afghanistan. We should bear in mind that our mission in Afghanistan is a noble one and will succeed if we stay the course. We should, though, be there only for as long as we need to be and not a minute more.

I rise, like all of them, to pay my respects to Sapper Rowan Robinson, another Australian hero who has given his life for his country at the tender age of 23. Sapper Robinson had been in the ADF for some five years, had two tours of duty to Afghanistan and had been awarded six decorations during that time.

As a former Minister for Defence I have been very determined to ensure that I make a contribution on each of these condolence motions, and as I do so this evening I lament the fact that I find myself repeating myself, but I felt it necessary to do so, because the same things need to be said. Many of those things have been said in this chamber this evening. The first is that while I did not know Sapper Robinson—although I must say it is possible that I may have met him; if I did I just do not recall—I am sure that Sapper Robinson knew exactly what he was doing in committing himself to the ADF's operations in Afghanistan and that he fully understood the risks but was as keen as mustard to undertake the task. Likewise, having had the not-always-happy experience of meeting, mixing with and consoling families of fallen soldiers, I am very confident that Sapper Robinson's parents would also have been very supportive of his decision to serve his country in a very, very dangerous theatre of war. It is very tough for the families involved, but I always sense when I meet with them that they draw some comfort from the fact that the person they love so much and who is now no longer with them was doing what he loved and wanted to do and were supportive of that.

Afghanistan does go directly to the security and safety of Australians, both here on our mainland—on our continent—and as we travel around the globe.

We continue to build social and economic capacity and we continue to play a role in building governance in Oruzgan province. In coalition with others we still play a role in building governance across the country. We will not meet with success in Afghanistan by military means alone. It will be a combined effort between military effort, the efforts in governance, the efforts in capacity building and the efforts in training more broadly.

I will say again what I have been saying for two years—and I say this for those who might be concerned about this: there is a big difference between negotiating with extremists and setting up dialogue with moderates. I think the latter can produce real results. Indeed, I think it is absolutely necessary. We cannot meet with ultimate success in Afghanistan without some form of political settlement. Afghanistan has to want to govern itself in a way we would expect them to, and the Afghan people have to have faith and trust in those who govern them. If we cannot achieve that, we will not meet with success. Again, I pay tribute to Sapper Rowan Robinson. He now will be recorded as a great Australian, a heroic Australian. The work of the sapper when out with special forces is of a kind we find difficult to fathom, wondering whether the next step will be your last. It is difficult for us to appreciate that. He was prepared to take those risks for those who were fighting alongside him, his mates. He was prepared to take those risks for the safety and security of his country and his fellow Australians. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to his family, his mum and dad, his mates, his friends and all who loved him.

As many have noted, this is a very dangerous job requiring a high level of skill and the most courageous soldiers. Sapper Robinson fitted into this category perfectly. Sapper Robinson has been described by his officers as a motivated, dedicated and highly professional soldier who recognised the dangerous and important nature of his role and took it extremely seriously. His family have spoken about how proud he was to be an Incident Response Regiment engineer.

You sometimes think about how you would react if you were put into a situation like that. It is only when you are actually faced with situations like that that you find out whether you have the bravery or not. The Army does a lot of training so that it becomes muscle memory and they train over and over and over again. They take their training very, very seriously because if they get it wrong people die. In some cases even when they get it right people die.

He was killed in crossfire but he was able to show the grit in his teeth and the steel in his spine that truly makes our soldiers and the men and women of our ADF the best defence force in the world. Earlier in the day he had been part of a team that removed the largest cache of weapons, ammunition, drugs and bomb components found in Afghanistan this year. The significance of this and the wider role played by Sapper Robinson cannot be overstated. What he did was to take those weapons out of circulation so that they could never be used against anybody else. Sapper Robinson played a crucial role in contributing to a crucial war.

We watch as our death toll from this deployment rises to 27. We must not forget what we are fighting for and how important it is. Afghanistan must become a democratic country where all its citizens are treated equally regardless of their age, sex, religion or ethnicity. Sapper Robinson was a brave soldier who played a role in Afghanistan that has not gone unnoticed, and he will never be forgotten. As I offer my deepest condolences to the Robinson family, I join the chorus of voices which reflect on the bravery and courage of a young soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice for his country and for the international community, and with the promise that he did not die in vain.

Our nation and those that cherish these sacred principles will forever be indebted to Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson.

He had been run over in training by an armoured vehicle, and in another incident he had survived an improvised explosive device which failed to detonate after a colleague who was right beside him trod on the device.

As an Australian community, we can only wonder and marvel at the courage and bravery of these young men who lay their lives down for Australia. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my support to Sapper Robinson's family and friends through this very difficult time and assure them that the sacrifice of this outstanding young Australian soldier will be remembered. They should know that Australia is proud of his courage, his selflessness, his service and the ultimate sacrifice that he has made. He will surely be sorely missed.

May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.
