        I acknowledge the 11th anniversary of the apology to our

        people, but I also stand here with great sorrow. Yesterday I spoke in this place about eight people who had fallen ill due to a deadly bacteria in the soil after the floods in Townsville. Sadly, one of those people has lost her life to the deadly illness, known as flood disease. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends during this difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an incredibly sad and timely reminder that the devastations of the flood are ongoing and the risks are very real. The number of cases of melioidosis infection has skyrocketed since the unprecedented flood event. Two more cases were confirmed today, bringing the total to 10 so far. Townsville residents are at an increased risk of contracting this disease. Melioidosis and the many other infections that stem from flooding can more severely impact people who are unwell or elderly or who have chronic conditions. Flood water is heavily contaminated with dirt, sewage and bacteria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vital public health message is to ensure that people are wearing protective clothing and shoes so that they do not have the floodwater come in contact with their body, particularly if they have cuts or scratches. To all people assisting in the clean-up, I thank you very much, but please stay safe. Please wear protective clothing and shoes, including airway protection, and, importantly, please stay hydrated during this very humid heat.
