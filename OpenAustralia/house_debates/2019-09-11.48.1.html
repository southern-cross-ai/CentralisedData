        of 1990, he was awarded an Order of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Throughout his years of service, he was a mentor to hundreds of soldiers and officers across a wide range of regimental postings. That experience would hold him in good stead for retirement. During his service life, he recognised that soldiers broken in service were looking for help in seeking compensation for injuries sustained during that service. That led to his commitment to help them, and the best way he could do that was to become an advocate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During his time as an advocate he has worked tirelessly helping hundreds of service and ex-service personnel, submitting claims on their behalf, as well as working for those seeking war widow status. He represents them at the Veterans' Review Board and gives advice and assistance to the

        Jeffrey Yates is a worthy recipient of the 2019 Anzac of the Year award. I congratulate him on his well-deserved recognition and I thank him for his service.
