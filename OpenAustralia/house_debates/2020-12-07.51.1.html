        I've spoken in this chamber before about the Epping Scouts. Years ago, they came to me seeking help to renew their boatshed in Meadowbank. Sitting next to the ferry's wharf, the site has been utilised by Scouts from the local area as well as provided a jetty and boat ramp for community use. Unfortunately, it was suffering from overcrowding and, more critically, concrete cancer. Epping Scouts sought government help, and thankfully we were able to provide it: a substantial grant that allowed them to commence building at the beginning of the year.

        This would not have been a simple task under normal circumstancesâ€”building right on the foreshore and managing tides and ferries amid precious mangroves. It would make this normally quite difficult, but when demolition of the old shed started in January, no-one could have foreseen the added difficulties 2020 was going to throw their way. So I was very proud to visit the site on 21 November to officially open the new building with my friend and state colleague Victor Dominello MP. It's a fantastic facility which will finally fit the growing needs of the Scouts and serve the movement and community at large for years to come. I was particularly delighted to see that the shed is named after local legend

        , the brains behind the new shed and the heart behind the local Scouts. Congratulations to Peter, Alan and everyone connected to this most worthwhile project.
