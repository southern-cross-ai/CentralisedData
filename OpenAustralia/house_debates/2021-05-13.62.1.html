       <p>
        Members here would be aware that the recent flooding on the east coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and Queensland caused significant damage and loss of life, property, livestock and other animals. Very tragically, two people lost their lives in that flooding. I want to talk today about the bravery of some people in my electorate who helped save lives in those recent floods. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        Waverley-Woollahra Unit, as well as the Bondi and Bronte lifesaving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRB" rel="nofollow">
         IRB
        </a>
        —inflatable rescue boat—crews, led by the Sydney branch commanders James McLennan and Matt Spooner, were quick to assemble crews and equipment once the flooding started and travelled to Windsor and nearby areas which were facing a dire situation due to the floods. All teams did an amazing job on and off the water in assisting where needed during a flood crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make particular mention of the Bondi IRB crew, especially Courtney Date and Richard Nicholas, and the Waverley-Woollahra SES members, Max Henderson and Michael Horn, whose heroic actions saved the lives of a family who were trapped underneath a marine rescue vessel that capsized on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colo_River" rel="nofollow">
         Colo River
        </a>
        during the family's evacuation. Upon seeing the unfolding emergency, without hesitation Courtney and Max courageously jumped in the cold and rapidly-moving water to rescue the adults and children trapped underneath the overturned boat. The adult evacuees were able to get out and were picked up by another SES crew, while Courtney and Max, in very difficult conditions and with near-zero visibility, ducked under the water and made several attempts, eventually successful, to rescue the children from the upturned boat. The other crew members supported the process by pulling evacuees out of the water and preventing the upturned boat from being washed away. This phenomenal rescue deserves our congratulations.
