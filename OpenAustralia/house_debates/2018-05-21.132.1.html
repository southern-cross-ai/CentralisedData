        I'd like to congratulation Casino's Karri Williams, who has just been named the Indigenous trainee of the year at the 2018 Hunter Valley Training Company Excellence Awards. Karri is 19 years old, a dental assistant trainee with the Northern New South Wales Local Health District Oral Health Services and has completed her traineeship at the Casino Aboriginal Medical Service over the past year. Karri is one of a number of local Indigenous trainees who are supported by a partnership between the Bulgarr Ngaru Medical Aboriginal Corporation and the Northern New South Wales Local Health District Oral Health Services. This partnership has helped Karri to complete her training in her hometown of Casino through the dental assistant trainee program. Again, congratulations to Karri for such a wonderful achievement. We are all very proud of you.

Bob's daughter, Katyana, who is now teaching at the school, was on hand to officially start the run. Well done to Trinity Catholic College.
