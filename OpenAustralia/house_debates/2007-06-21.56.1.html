        I move:

         Committee Act 1969
        </i>
        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision of facilities for Project Single

         LEAP
        </a>
        —Phase 2.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is indeed an expedient project and I would welcome the parliament’s support for this motion today. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        intends to deliver new single residential accommodation, associated facilities, infrastructure and services on 17
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        bases in all states and territories except Tasmania. I am pleased as the local member for Townsville, which has Australia’s largest defence base,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Lavarack Barracks
        </a>
        , home of the 3rd Brigade—which, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, you have visited on many occasions—that there will be several hundred single-soldier accommodation units built to augment the 1,100 already on base.
       </p>
       <p>
        The strategy being proposed by the Department of Defence is to engage a ‘strategic partner’ for the delivery of:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         financing;
        </li>
        <li>
         planning the development;
        </li>
        <li>
         construction;
        </li>
        <li>
         maintenance; and
        </li>
        <li>
         operation.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The government announced funding in the 2004-05 budget for Project Single LEAP—phase 1 and phase 2 inclusive—of $113.2 million over four years and then an annual allocation of approximately $60 million thereafter. The cost of phase 2 will be determined through a competitive tender process, subject to government selection of a preferred tenderer and parliamentary approval. The estimated out-turned cost is $1.2 billion—net present value—and will involve a regular service payment by Defence over 30 years for buildings, infrastructure, facilities management services, maintenance and life cycle costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. I am pleased to advise the House that the Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in early 2009 and be completed in 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government I would like to thank the chair of the committee and member for Pearce,

        Question agreed to.
