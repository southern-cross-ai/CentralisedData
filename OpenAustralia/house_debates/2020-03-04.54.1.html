        My question is to the Minister for Health. Will the minister update the House on global and domestic developments relating to the coronavirus and what action the Morrison government is taking to protect Australians' health from this outbreak?

        <p>
         Thank you very much to the member for Wentworth, who, having served Australia in the most distinguished way on the international stage, is well aware of the importance of global events and the connectedness of Australiaâ€”the fact that we are not immune but we are always prepared, as we are now. In particular, in the latest advice, I can now inform the House that over 92,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed around the world. Particularly with a country like Iran, however, we know that that is likely to be a higher figure because there are unreported and undocumented cases. We also know that there are over 3,100 lives that have been recorded as having been lost and that it has now transmitted to 78 countries and regions around the world, including Argentina, Morocco and Ukraine for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, I mentioned Iran. We moved early on Saturday, ahead of most of the world, indeed the vast majority of the world, in putting in place a travel ban. Events of the last few days have indicated that that was the right decision but that the situation in Iran is likely to be even more comprehensive than had been understood by the world previously. As a consequence of that, following the Prime Minister's request to the chief health and medical officers yesterday, they've been looking at high-risk cases and recommended, and we have implemented the decision, to require all people in Australia who have been in Iran and arrived in Australia since February 19 to self-isolate. This has been taken as an important and precautionary measure, particularly given that the number of cases in Australia that have an Iranian connection has now increased to 10. Domestically, the Australian cases are at 41, including the 10 with an Iranian connection.
        </p>

         Most concerning is that

         Health identified overnight that a worker from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge, an aged-care facility in

         within the electorate of Bennelong, has been confirmed to have coronavirus. Eleven residents have been isolated. Tests are being conducted on one patient who is in hospital and another 95-year-old former resident who very recently passed away. As that material becomes available, it will be provided. What is important to understand is that on identification, both

         and the facility immediately implemented the steps that had been planned, agreed and prepared. As a consequence, the best possible protection for the residents is being put in place. I want to thank all of them, but I indicate that this is a case of planning, preparation and implementation to protect Australians.
