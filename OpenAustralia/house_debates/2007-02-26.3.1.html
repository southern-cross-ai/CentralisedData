       <p>
        On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Vocational Training, I present the committee’s report of the inquiry into teacher education entitled
        <i>
         Top of the class: report of the inquiry into teacher education
        </i>
        , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teacher education is undeniably important to the social and economic wellbeing of Australia. Research has found that the quality of teaching a student receives is the most important factor influencing their achievement. This means that better quality teacher education has the potential to improve the effectiveness of the entire school system. Investment in teacher education can increase the academic performance of students, reduce the need for remedial programs and ease the negative social and economic consequences of educational underachievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to state that the teacher education system is not in crisis—it currently serves Australia well, but it could do better. The committee’s recommendations suggest improvements at every stage of teacher education. Each recommendation is worth while as a stand-alone measure but together the recommendations constitute a powerful reform package.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first two recommendations are aimed at creating a sound research base for teacher education. The committee is concerned that there has been little previous work to establish what is meant by ‘quality’ teacher education and recommends a longitudinal study of teacher education to assess the effectiveness of different models. To assist in putting education on a sound research base, the committee also recommends that a specific educational research fund, modelled on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
         NHMRC
        </a>
        , be established to provide funding for high-quality research into teacher education.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the committee’s key recommendations is that a national system of accreditation of university teacher education courses be established. This system would be based on a national set of professional teaching standards, which would also guide state and territory teacher registration authorities. The accreditation of teacher education courses by a national body would provide for greater consistency and rigour and would facilitate the portability of teaching qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teacher education already attracts many high-achieving students; however, the committee recommends extra funding to increase the diversity of entrants to teacher education. There is also an imbalance between the numbers of students in particular teacher education courses and the number and types of teachers needed—for instance, most states report an oversupply of primary school teachers but an undersupply of secondary maths and science teachers. The committee recommends a more tightly focused allocation of places in teacher education courses to meet demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Practicum is an area which frequently presents problems for universities. While practicum is highly valued by students, it is also frequently criticised because of the weak links between theory and practice and the variable quality of supervision. Length and quality of practicum varies significantly from university to university. The committee recommends the establishment of a national teacher education partnership fund to establish collaborative approaches to practicum, research, induction and professional development. The committee also recommends a rethink of the current funding for practicum. The actual costs of providing practicum need to be accurately determined, and universities should be paid a separate amount which fully covers the practicum component.
       </p>
       <p>
        The transition from university to becoming a teacher is an area that has previously been neglected, with induction of new teachers generally being the responsibility of the employing school. The committee recommends that the Australian government encourage, by partially financing, a year-long, structured induction program for beginning teachers. The program would include an allocated mentor and a 20 per cent reduction in the beginning teacher’s face-to-face teaching load.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teacher education does not end at graduation. Teachers must continue learning throughout their careers. Hence, the committee recommends that all teachers commit to ongoing professional learning and that this be a requirement for renewal of registration. Ongoing professional learning could be rewarded if it were linked with higher levels of registration and pay. Much of the educational research that is being done in Australia does not easily find its way into teaching practice; therefore, the committee supports a feasibility study into the establishment of a national clearing house for educational research by Teaching Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the committee recommends a range of funding measures to put teacher education on a sounder financial footing. While the committee considers that universities should retain the flexibility to determine the distribution of funds allocated to them, there should be greater transparency in the system and they should be required to report on expenditure in greater detail. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth contribution rate for education be increased significantly and that the impact on teacher education of capping the student contribution rate be evaluated. There is widespread concern that the cost of providing teacher education is underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report is by no means the first inquiry into teacher education. During the last two decades, over 80 reports on teacher education have been produced. In seeking to make an original contribution where so many have preceded us, the committee has stepped back to look at the whole system from a national perspective. The committee’s aim was to make a number of practical and achievable recommendations that would address the most pressing and longstanding issues in teacher education. I commend this report to the House.

        <p>
         I am pleased to support the comments of the member for Cowper in the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Vocational Training entitled
         <i>
          Top of the class: report of the inquiry into teacher education
         </i>
         . I acknowledge the excellent work of the chair and the members of the committee. However, I want to particularly highlight the outstanding work of the secretariat, and it is good to see three of them here in the House today. The committee secretary, Jan Holmes, is to be congratulated on her professionalism, enthusiasm, strength and perseverance in putting together a most lucid and professional report. Well done, Janet.
        </p>
        <p>
         The chair’s strength of listening, patience and preparedness to allow the report to evolve on the evidence available proved to be a solid foundation for what could be a watershed report for not only teacher education but also education generally. There is no doubt in my mind that, over the last 30 years, we as a nation have dropped the ball on many aspects of education. Technical and vocational education, literacy and numeracy in our primary schools, mathematics, science and physical education are examples; teacher education is another. Twenty-five reports in 20 years have sent many mixed messages.
        </p>
        <p>
         We should be investing more in the basic foundation for any improvement in education in a very competitive world. There is no doubt that a dollar spent on teacher education provides a return on every other dollar this nation invests in education. If we cannot get teacher education right, we diminish every other initiative and every other expenditure in education. Education is a trinity. Firstly, it is a set of ideas. It is the impact of mind upon mind. Secondly, it is a process that should enhance the quality of relationships between teachers, children and parents. Thirdly, it is a program—and the quality and balance of the educational curriculum and pedagogy are crucial. All three depend on the quality of the teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thirty years ago, Australia was regarded internationally as a beacon for education in the world. We were  ‘top of the class’. It is time we regained that prominence. The implementation of the recommendations contained in this report would be very strong beginning points for not only teacher education but also education generally. The report recommends a national system of teacher accreditation. There is no doubt whatsoever that, with the internationalisation of education, Australia needs a national approach. Education debates in this country are more often than not non-productive. Claims and counterclaims made by so many are simply not substantiated. Teacher education is a case in point. As the chair pointed out, it is not in crisis; however, with wise investment it could be better. One glaring omission is the lack of evidential research and data underpinning education policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Three of the report’s 12 recommendations focus on research. Firstly, a longitudinal study should be commissioned into the effectiveness of different models of teacher education. Secondly, a specific education research fund should be established on a model similar to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research Council
         </a>
         . Thirdly, the proposal by Teaching Australia to conduct a feasibility study into the establishment of a national clearing house for education research ought to be supported. In other words, let’s stop guessing. Let’s get serious about education, and let’s stop burdening teachers with every untested whim, fad or fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Researchers Skillbeck and Connell tell us that selection for teaching should draw upon the wide cultural diversity of Australian society. In practice, this does not occur. Too many selected entrants for teacher education are increasingly middle-class, metropolitan and female. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with any of those attributes. However, it is desirable, as recommendation 4 states, that a teacher education diversity fund of $20 million be established to encourage more diversity in entry to teacher education: people from Indigenous, lower socioeconomic, non-English-speaking, cultural, rural and remote backgrounds, and males in primary education.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have already mentioned that any investment in teacher education will have a return on every other dollar invested in education. The 12 recommendations to increase our investment in teacher education are modest and minimal and are in the national interest to return Australia’s reputation internationally to where it ought to be: ‘top of the class’.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other recommendations tackle practices and partnerships, teacher induction and ongoing professional learning. Overall, the 12 recommendations provide a sensible and common-sense set of pathways to allow teacher education in Australia to be world class. The report is balanced and even and has a pluralistic approach. I commend the report to the House.
