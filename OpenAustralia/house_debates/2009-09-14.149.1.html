        I rise to give my condolences for the life of Matthew John Leonard, who was just 28 years old when he died in a plane crash near Kokoda in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        on 11 August 2008. On Friday, 4 September I attended the funeral of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Leonard" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at the Greenwood Catholic Parish, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints" rel="nofollow">

        church. At that moving service, it was apparent to those of us who did not know him that he was held in the highest regard. A graduate of the

        , he had moved from his home in Western Australia to Melbourne. In Melbourne he embarked on a career with the

        , undertaking training and then graduating to serve at the

        station house. Serving for two years as a fireman, he was also involved in training fire fighters in Asia and was a tour guide for No Roads Expeditions, a responsibility that saw him in Papua New Guinea and sadly onboard the plane that crashed and took the lives of 11 passengers and two crew members on that day.

        At the service for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Leonard" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I report to the House, the church was packed. The family, friends and colleagues—those who knew Matthew Leonard well—were abundant. There is nothing surprising about that. The eulogy and the statements paint a picture of a young man who added great value in everything he did. Nothing was too much trouble for Matt and he was a great friend to all. Clearly Matt Leonard’s family, friends and colleagues will miss him greatly. His loss will forever be felt by all those who knew him. Those of us who did not know him feel a very great regret. Once again, for their loss, I express my condolences to Matthew Leonard’s parents, Bill and Anne, and his brothers, Russ and Mike, and his sister, Bec.
