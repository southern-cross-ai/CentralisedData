       <p>
        I rise to speak about something of incredible importance to my local community, and that is fixing local roads and reducing congestion, and, in particular, a looming threat to those efforts to get local residents home to their families sooner and saferâ€”that is, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Labor Party
        </a>
        . During the federal election I managed to secure $25 million from the Morrison government to upgrade a local congestion hotspot. Working with the lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, we have already got work underway. Just last week, we announced a successful overpass design so that work could get started on this project. How did Queensland Labor respond? Well, the Brisbane City Council Labor lord mayoral candidate responded by calling it a 'wicked, wicked waste'. This is what the Labor Party really thinks about reducing congestion.

       <p>
        I say to the residents of Ryan: when it comes to federal funding to reduce congestion, Labor says it's a waste; when it comes to getting you home to your families sooner and spending less time in the car, Labor says it's a waste; when it comes to making sure that mum and dad make it home to the kids at night, Labor says it's a waste.
       </p>

        This is a very, very dangerous intersection. There have been 32 serious incidents in the last couple of years, 10 requiring serious and ongoing hospitalisation. Apparently that isn't enough for Labor. They still think it is a waste. What a disgrace. Queensland Labor should disown this candidate or prove once and for all, after decades of Labor neglect, that only the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will help reduce congestion in the western suburbs and in the Ryan electorate.
