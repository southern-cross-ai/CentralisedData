          I thank the member for Isaacs for his question and for the opportunity to visit the South East Melbourne Manufacturing Alliance with him in Dandenong, just outside his electorate, before the last federal election, which gave me extra perspectives on the challenges facing small businesses. A high-speed national broadband network will be of particular benefit to small businesses. About 93 per cent of small businesses are connected to the internet. The governmentâ€™s national high-speed broadband network will provide fast broadband services to 98 per cent of Australia. The government broadband rollout will provide real opportunities for small businesses, especially those in the service economy, to expand into new markets while also keeping upfront costs and risks to a minimum.

             High-speed broadband also provides opportunities to reduce the cost of doing business by cutting administrative costs and increasing productivity through the adoption of new technologies. I was asked about alternative policy perspectives. A speech delivered to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Institute" rel="nofollow">
              Sydney Institute
             </a>
             in 1999 provides such perspectives. The speech says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The fusion of computing and communications, especially through the internet, have broken the bounds of time, cost and distance.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was fascinated to see that this is a perspective shared in its entirety with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
              United Nations
             </a>
             <i>
              Human development report
             </i>
             published in that same year, which said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The fusion of computing and communicationsâ€”especially through the internetâ€”has broken the bounds of time, cost and distance â€¦
            </p>
            <p>
             The speech went on to observe:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             In biotechnology, the ability to identify and move genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally new organisms with enormous but unknown implications â€¦
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, the
             <i>
              Human development report
             </i>
             says:

            <p class="italic">
             In biotechnology the ability to identify and move genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally new organisms with enormous but unknown implications.
            </p>
            <p>
             The speech went on to say:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             â€¦ both the communications technologies and the biotechnologies are fuelling globalisation, opening new markets and giving rise to new actors.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought that was familiar, because it says in the

                  Order, I have indicated to the member for Moncrieff that I am listening very carefully to where the minister is going; and I am assuming that he is coming to a conclusion.

                  <p>
                   I am indeed, Mr Speaker. The learned speech to the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Institute" rel="nofollow">
                    Sydney Institute

                   says:

                  <p class="italic">
                   â€¦ but my point is that, compared with most traditional tools for development, information and communication technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost.

                  <p>
                   Well, was it the authorâ€™s point, Mr Speaker? Was it indeed the authorâ€™s point, because in the
                   <i>
                    Human development report
                   </i>
                   it says:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   Compared with most traditional tools for development, information and communications technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost.

                  <p>
                   Who is the author? The shadow Treasurerâ€”the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She has been caught out copying again. She is a serial offender. At that time the now shadow Treasurer was a backbencher, and she delivered that speech at the same forum on the same day with me. We did not have chiefs of staffâ€”we were backbenchers. It was not the fault of a chief of staff this time. The member for Curtin, the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is a serial offender and she has been caught red-handed yet again.
