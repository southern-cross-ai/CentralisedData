        I rise today to ask the Prime Minister to deliver for the community of Dunkley the promises that he has made. On 6 February 2019—not last year but the year before—the Prime Minister came to my electorate, specifically to Skye, to announce $30 million to upgrade intersections at Ballarto Road. As was reported in the
        <i>
         Frankston Times
        </i>
        on 11 February 2019, exactly what those upgrades would be had not been finalised. Well, it has still not been finalised. The government hasn't handed over any money to the state government to upgrade Ballarto Road and commitments made by the state government on Lyrebird Drive can't go ahead until the Prime Minister does more than make promises for my community; he needs to actually deliver. In the dying days of that 2019 election, the Prime Minister and his government announced $38.5 million for three—count them: three—commuter car parks in my electorate: Seaford, Kananook and Frankston. Frankston is to have half state and half federal government funding. The state government is ready to go. Where's the federal government? Where's the money for Kananook and Seaford commuter car parks? There is a lot of work to be done in public transport and car parking across the electorate. We're just asking the Prime Minister to deliver what he promised.
