        Since its election, the Abbott government has systematically dismantled measures established to raise animal welfare standards associated with Australia's live export trade. The commitment by Labor to appoint an inspector-general of animal welfare was rejected by the Abbott government. The existing Animal Welfare Advisory Committee was abolished. So too was the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy, established by the coalition in 2005. Whilst the Export Supply Chain Assurance Scheme is still in place, $2.3 million for funding for the live animal export business assistance program, which assisted importing countries to apply the standards, has also been scrapped.

        In a further measure announced earlier this year, I understand that memoranda of understanding will no longer be required for new overseas export markets before Australian livestock can be exported. Following in the footsteps of the

        </a>
        , we now even seen moves in Australia to prosecute animal welfare advocates and brand them as terrorists if they in any way infringe a law whilst exposing animal cruelty.

        will be resumed and he accuses Labor of destroying the beef cattle industry. He conveniently forgets that it was the Howard government that stopped live exports to Egypt in 2006 and it was under the Abbott government's watch in April this year that $170 million of beef trade to Russia, the equivalent of the live trade to Indonesia, was suspended. And it is the Abbott government that is now jeopardising trade with Arab nations over the Attorney-General's declaration that Australia would no longer refer to

        as 'occupied'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact is that in the last four years of Labor, during a time of drought and falling production, total beef and veal exports rose from $4 billion in 2009-10 to $5 billion in 2012-13. In particular, exports to China increased from 7,736 tonnes to 92,278 tonnes in 2012-13, and currently are much higher than that, while exports to the Middle East were also 51 per cent higher for the year. Around $7.5 billion of exports are processed in Australia annually, and the opportunities to increase exports of Australian processed meats are upwardly growing. The real challenge to Australia's beef growers will be their ability to meet the demand. Local processing makes more sense. An increase in processed meats exports means more jobs are created in Australia and animal welfare standards can be maintained. Furthermore, animals are not subjected to long and often torturous sea transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, while the government encourages live exports, it has a responsibility to ensure that the Australian welfare standards are monitored and enforced. That includes the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme conditions. Yes, the cattle and sheep are destined to die. But they do not have to die a cruel, terrifying and barbaric death. Surely we are more civilised than that?
