        Australia is going through some of the toughest times on record: fire, flood, ash clouds, hailstorms and, underlying it all, a deep and crippling drought. People across Australia are doing it tough. In Bennelong, we have been fortunate. Our only direct impact from any of this weather chaos has been a spot fire in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Epping" rel="nofollow">

        and the impermeable smoke that all of Sydney has had to deal with. This is a pittance compared with the daily struggles many in the west of

        are facing every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to this devastation we have seen Australians come forward in droves to support those in need. Millions of dollars have been donated to numerous causes, and Australians far and wide have opened their hearts and their wallets to help those in desperate need. We may not have seen the devastation in our area, but we have seen the generosity. There are thousands I could single out from Bennelong who have given their all and more, but I will be singing the praises of just one today: the great Leigh Smart.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leigh is a stalwart of the community. Founder and manager of Formula Chemicals, his family business, he now runs a team of dozens of committed people. From pool chemicals to industrial ones, Leigh and his team ensure that the chemicals we rely on in our everyday lives are provided as safely and sustainably as possible. Success in business has allowed Leigh to become a philanthropist, spreading his generosity around the community and the greater region. After hiring a number of Fijian workers and hearing their stories, he created the

        Foundation to provide education and healthcare needs for people on the outlying islands of Fiji who don't have access to the services we take for granted.

        With a history like this it's no surprise that he has been at the forefront of the charity efforts in Bennelong, but the efforts he has gone to are amazing. He has taken part in the Caring for our Farmers convoy since November and just last weekend was part of the smart drought relief water run out to Baradine. As part of his business Leigh has access to large tanks and several trucks, and, recognising their potential in this crippling drought, signed up to take approximately 150,000 litres of water out to the bush for the first Caring for our Farmers convoy in November, using his vehicles to transport the water. When this became known in his company, he was swamped with volunteers to take the run, eventually settling on a team of six, which included some of his team who had never been out west before. News also leaked to the community, and an incredible three tonnes of food, drinks and presents were donated, which went to the Baradine

        food pantry. Melrose Park Public School was incredibly generous, as were dozens of local companies and even

        , which stepped up to provide 400 kilograms of

        , thus saving Christmas for many. Leigh also donated 1,000 litres of chlorine for the local swimming pool, to give the local kids a place to play out of the sun during the heat and the long summer holidays.

        The convoy was a huge success, and Leigh tells of all that he witnessed: not only heartbreaking suffering but also the gratefulness, community strength and resilience. By all accounts, the need for the actions of Leigh, his team and the other convoy members was acute, and the response to the convoy was immense. There is always more to do, which is why Leigh set out again over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        weekend. In the weeks between convoys Leigh purchased a 30,000 litre water tank from Queensland, as none were available in New South Wales. This was filled with potable water, and it joined the convoy alongside four other trucks carrying 10,000 litres of cattle water, 680 fifteen-litre drums of drinking water, 8,000 kilograms of fruit and vegetables and, critically, a pallet of beerâ€”or maybe two. Leigh has described this as a life-changing event for everyone in his team. In his own words: 'We really don't know how lucky we are here in the city. Don't ever complain again about the trivial matters in your life when you understand that these poor farmers are doing it so tough.' Leigh, you and your team are champions. You are a tribute to your community. Your compassion, as well as your can-do spirit, has made a real difference to Australians doing it tough. We are in your debt. I might say that Leigh is much older than I am, and he works seven days a week.
