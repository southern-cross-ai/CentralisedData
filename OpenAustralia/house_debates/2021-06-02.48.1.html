         Westminster School
        </a>
        recently celebrated the official opening of its new Inquiry and Innovation Hub, named the Carter Wing, and I was delighted to be in attendance. Westminster School is located in the heart of my electorate of Boothby and has educated many generations of locals, including my father, Evan, and my Uncle Tim. The new Inquiry and Innovation Hub is a fantastic facility with new learning spaces and laboratories in which students will gain knowledge of the sciences, psychology, engineering, information technology, digital technology, fashion design, materials and food technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        This investment by Westminster is the first stage of a $40 million upgrade to the school, the largest re-investment in the school since it was opened by Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies in 1961. Our current Prime Minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison MP, recorded a special video message in acknowledgement of the opening, and the South Australian Governor, His Excellency the Hon. Hiew Van Le, officially opened the new building.

        I again offer my heartfelt congratulations to Westminster School; their principal,

        ; school council chairman Phillip Styles; and the entire Westminster School community on the opening of the Carter Wing. I was particularly delighted to see former teachers Brian Ferris, Ray Trenowden and David Jarman and his wife Jeanette there at the celebration. Not only were they teachers for many years at this wonderful school but they are all incredible, very active local volunteers in our Boothby community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Westminster School has been one of the pillars of primary and secondary education in Boothby. I congratulate it on this exciting new development.
