        We've all had a fantastic couple of weeks watching the Olympics. Where do these athletes come from? They come from places like Maitland, home to the Maitland Basketball Association and the Maitland Mustangs. I'd like to thank Amy McGregor,

        , coach Luke Boyle and team manager Michelle. I want to send a special shout-out to the development manager, Dan Howard. Dan, you are doing an incredible job. You have created opportunities for students in regional schools to access, learn and play basketball for free, often for the very first time, without having to travel long distances to sporting centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dan recognised that regional schools needed a basketball program, and he decided to make a difference. Together with the Maitland Mustangs senior teams—who recently became the champions of

        1; go mighty Maitland Mustangs—he travelled to regional schools, providing fund-free basketball classes in those schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 500 children have been granted these opportunities, all thanks to Dan, whose commitment to growing the next generation of basketball players and fans is really remarkable. Programs like these are so important to delivering healthy outcomes and opportunities for everyone, not just for those who can afford it. Who knows? We may see these kids at the Brisbane 2032 Olympics, playing for the Opals or the Boomers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the privilege of catching up with Dan and the Maitland Mustangs to check out the new

        equipment they purchased through volunteer grant funding that I was able to help them secure. Dan is humble, kind and generous. He is such a great guy. He goes the extra mile for our young people to advocate for his beloved sport and to coach for Basketball
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        . I want to thank you, Dan, for your tireless commitment, not only to your beloved basketball but also to those kids who are going to get so much out of it.

        I'd also like to congratulate Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council and their

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for winning the visitor attraction award at the Inavate Asia-Pacific Awards 2024 in Bangkok. This is an international award. It's an extraordinary achievement for Worimi. If you haven't had a chance to go to Murrook Culture Centre, it is a place not only of learning but of intentional spirituality. It is just remarkable. Do yourself a favour and go visit. They extend 60,000 years of knowledge and hospitality to us all, and I congratulate them and thank them for that deeply.
