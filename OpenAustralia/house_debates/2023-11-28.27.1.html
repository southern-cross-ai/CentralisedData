        The Raise Our Voice Australia campaign allows our young people to express their vision for our nation's parliament. Today I'm thrilled to speak on behalf of 12-year-old Grace McMahon, from my electorate of Maranoa. Grace poses a serious question: how many people in Australia are struggling with the cost of living? Showing wisdom beyond her years, Grace knows the answer is: a lot. She writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We all know that cost of living is getting expensive, but did you know that according to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAB" rel="nofollow">
         NAB
        </a>
        's Consumer Insights Survey, this year, 43 per cent of Australians experienced some form of financial hardship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One in five of those surveyed also reported not having enough money for food and basic necessities or being unable to pay a bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        How many

         Members of Parliament
        </a>
        , have ever had to choose between paying a bill and feeding your family?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Interest rates have risen by four percentage points since May last year because of inflation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result, a potential 1.6 million people are at risk of losing their home, my family included.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My solution is a simple one - make the banks keep interest rates at a fixed rate permanently.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will mean that when people borrow money, they know exactly what they will need to repay - no unexpected changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians will be able to manage their money better, resulting in lower stress rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I might not understand inflation, but I know that costs will keep rising, and this might just be one way to help our people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need to think about Australia's future if we want to make Australia a better place.
