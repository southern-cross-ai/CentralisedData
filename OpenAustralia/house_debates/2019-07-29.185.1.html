       <p>
        I hope the member for Moreton invited some Anglicans along to that function! On Saturday I was asked a question about the wellbeing of Bill Jeffs. Now, Bill Jeffs is one of the most amazing advocates for public education I've ever met. He was a primary school teacher at Korumburra Primary School, and he really gave it to me about public education. The last time I saw Bill Jeffs was actually at a function around education in Korumburra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill Jeffs was one of 80 primary school principals in my electorate. And as it's getting far more difficult for principals of schools to deal with the issues of the day, not only their administration but also their interaction with parents, their need to educate their children and the responsibilities we're putting on them, I just want to give a great shout-out to primary school principals not just across my electorate but also across Australia, to say: this parliament really is generously appreciative of what you do every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        We'd like to say to the Bill Jeffs of this world, and even all the retired principals: you've made a huge contribution. We thank you for that, but we mostly recognise those school principals that are doing it hard every day. Don't think you're on your own. Actually, there are lots of people, like myself and many members of this House—I'd say all members of this House—who keep you in mind in the decisions that we take and wish you every goodwill in the job that you do, and we do so on behalf of our kids.
