        My question goes to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Will the minister please update the House on how Australia's national security remains under threat of foreign interference and espionage? What action is the Morrison government taking to ensure that we stay vigilant to this pervasive threat in order to keep all Australians safe and protect our national interest?

         I thank the member for his question and I acknowledge and thank him for his longstanding interest in defence and national security matters. Our government has never lost sight of the fact that there are many challenges to our safety and security in a changing world. It's without doubt that the threat environment is changing, and it's changing very rapidly. I think it would shock most Australians to know that levels of espionage and foreign interference are higher now than during the Cold War. We know that there are foreign agents working with intent to damage our society and to undermine our security. We face threats from multiple countries. Their purpose is to influence the work of our democratic government to further their own interests and world view.

         's annual report, which was tabled this week, director-general
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
          Mike Burgess
         </a>
         said that espionage could well overtake terrorism as the principal security concern over the next five years. And that is not to downplay the serious terrorist threat that we face here. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Foreign spies are attempting to obtain classified information about Australia's trade relationships, defence and intelligence capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They are seeking to develop targeted relationships with current and former politicians, and current and former security clearance holders.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They are monitoring diaspora communities in Australia and, in some cases, threatening to physically harm members of these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         We cannot let this pervasive activity undermine the social cohesion and unity that keeps our Australian community safe. Every one of us in this parliament, in our daily activities, must remain aware of and alert to this threat, and we should be very careful not to underplay the danger. We cannot afford to be cavalier about the intentions of these characters should our paths cross with them as we go about our duties.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is certainly taking these threats very seriously. That's why we are boosting ASIO's capability with record funding of $1.3 billion to enhance its operations into the future and to help keep us safe. We've legislated a range of new powers to help our law enforcement agencies to detect and act on foreign interference threats, and we're working with the University Foreign Interference Taskforce to ensure that Australian universities have robust mechanisms to safeguard them against foreign interference. Australians can be assured that the Morrison government takes very seriously issues of national security.
