       <p>
        On Saturday I attend the Hobartians Facing Homelessness rally, where again I was outraged to hear stories from people about the great difficulties they face sleeping rough or finding and keeping a safe and affordable roof over their heads. This dire situation is getting worse, as evidenced by Tasmania's social housing waiting list doubling over the last eight years, with 4,453 applicants now queued up, and priority applicants waiting an average of 67 weeks to be accommodated. But, of course, averages don't tell the whole story. I can think of a particular family who've been on the priority waiting list for almost seven years, despite currently living in a private rental plagued with black mould, holes in the ceiling and cracked windows.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make matters worse, private rentals are no longer an option for many, as they are so scarce and unaffordable, with Hobart's vacancy rate sitting currently at 0.6 per cent. And, for many of the lucky home hunters who are successful and do secure a property, the rent is so high that they face the very real decision of whether to forgo medical appointments, heating, fuel or even food to afford the rent. Indeed, the Rental Affordability Index continues to rate Greater Hobart as the country's least affordable metropolitan area, with the median rent having increased by 50 per cent since 2016. With interest rising, we can expect rents to increase further as rises are handballed on to tenants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The situation really is grim, and we need a hell of a lot more than bandaid solutions if we are to turn things around. For instance, at the local government level, we need to free up land, facilitate sensible developments and applications more efficiently, and rein in the conversion of long-term rentals for short-stay holiday accommodation. At the state level, we need more crisis accommodation, more social housing, more supported accommodation for people with special needs, and rent-to-buy public housing. Of course, at the federal level we need an extension of the

        , an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance and deep investment property tax reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a positive note, though, good on

        , which just last night decided to investigate higher rates for homes used as short-stay accommodation. This is a smart move, especially seeing that Hobart has, proportionally, seven times more Airbnbs than Sydney, which is patently unsustainable and unacceptable when locals are being forced into the cold.
       </p>
       <p>
        The housing crisis is the result of years of flawed policymaking at all levels of government. But it can be remedied and sure needs to be, because access to safe, secure and affordable housing is a fundamental human right.
