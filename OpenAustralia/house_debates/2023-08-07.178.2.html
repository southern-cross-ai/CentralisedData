        Recently I visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU" rel="nofollow">
         KU
        </a>
        preschool in Castlecrag and spent time with Director Ainslie Quinn, Education and Quality Manager Kylie Anderson and the wonderful lilly pilly group of children. While the grown-ups discussed the importance of accessible and respectful early childhood learning facilities the kids literally wove in and out of our conversation, throwing questions and ideas to me. The incredible team there guides the learning of the children in their care through play based techniques, developing not just their social and emotional wellbeing but ultimately their life skills. Yet this is not easily done under current conditions. The director appealed to me to make the following case.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to rethink the terminology used around this profession and ensure that people working in it are recognised for the role they play as educators. Those working in this sector deserve to be paid fairly and compensated for the hours they spend not just face to face but also preparing for school. Play based learning is about listening and gathering the children's ideas and presenting opportunities for these to be unpacked in a way that excites, engages and delights the childâ€”be it learning to care and empathy through role-play in the family space, building skills to tie shoelaces or type on the computer, exploring mathematical concepts by sorting blocks, or learning about colours and textures when they gather leaves outside. It's about trying, failing and celebrating.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we want to heed these words, it's clear that 600 hours is nowhere near enough to get this done. Early childhood educators are the voice of our children.
