        I'd like to read a speech from Milli McDonald, from Kardinia college in my electorate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When my grandfather landed in this country, he had nothing but the clothes on his back and eight dollars in his pocket. He had fled Yugoslavia's communist regime. For him, freshly 18, Australia was a welcoming, kind "golden country," full of promise, hopes and dreams for his future family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am now two months away from turning 18, and 53 years after my grandfather landed, have my own dreams for Australia. In 20 years, I envision a country that presents everyone with the opportunities of the "golden country."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I see equitable access to education, healthcare and careers that spans gender, race and sexual orientation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I see us upholding our international responsibilities: Doing our fair share on climate change. Treating those fleeing their homes with kindness and respect. To remember we have "boundless planes to share."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our generation's call to action is on climate. We must not see net zero as a threat, but an opportunity. We have an abundance of natural resources. 20 years gives us the chance to become a green energy powerhouse, to create jobs in green energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We must "maintain [our] rage and enthusiasm," for gender equality. For racial equality. For climate justice. For refugees. For our "golden country."
       </p>
       <p>
        Milli McDonald is 17 years old. I met her a few weeks ago. She is about to complete year 12, in just a few weeks time, and she hopes to study politics next year at the University of Canberra, and she is very excited about her future. When I met her, she was very keen to talk to me about the misogyny speech made by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, a speech I was in the House for on that day, which I shared with her.
       </p>
       <p>
        The speech I read is part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week project, which is run by Raise Our Voice Australia. It has encouraged a number of young people to write speeches to be read in parliament, and I'm one of 40 MPs participating in this project. It holds a particular resonance for me, because a long time ago—in the last century—I did my work experience with Senator Olive Zakharov of the other place. Indeed, in that week Senator Zakharov asked me to write a speech for her to deliver in the Senate, which she did. I have to say it was heavily edited and not many of my words made it, but I was still really excited about it! It was something of an inspiration for me.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project allows us to hear Milli's voice, as we did, and the fine words—much finer than mine, I might say—that she has been able to give us access to today. It's also something of an inspiration for her.
