        Prime Minister, it is 114 years since women received the vote—a long time ago. It took them 41 years to get a member in parliament, yet in your ministry you have got a significantly lower proportion of women than voted at the elections. Does the government think Liberal women members are less worthy or of lower merit—

         <p>
          Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. It is 114 years since women received the vote—a long time ago. It took them 41 years to get a member in parliament, yet in your ministry you have got a significantly lower proportion of women than voted at the elections. Does the government think Liberal women or members are less worthy or of lower merit than their Liberal male colleagues, or do you just say you believe in gender equality and fail to do anything about it?

           Mr Speaker, on a point of order. There are 237 people who have lost their jobs in Queensland Nickel, and a fair few of them are women and they are still wanting their things.

              <p>
               Let me say, Mr Speaker, there are nine women in the executive government—five in the cabinet. Looking around our party rooms, we have a lot of talent from a lot of women. We have women who have been journalists, women who have been teachers, university lecturers and an army officer. Many of our women members have had experience in small business; there are lawyers and there are number of farmers. We have a pilot—the Minister for Health is a very distinguished pilot and shearers cook, no less. We do not have to confess—it is not a comprehensive list—that we have any former trade union officials, but I gather there are plenty of those on the other side.

                 I can say that we are committed as parties to see more women in parliament and more women in the executive, and that is something that we will always work towards. Do you know that last year 60,000 more women joined the workforce than men? In the December quarter the highest level of female participation in full-time work was recorded in our history. That is a very good thing.

                 I have to remind honourable members opposite that they are presently standing in the way of the government's very significant reforms on child care, which, if enacted, will have the effect of enabling more women, particularly those on lower incomes, to join the workforce and have access to the continuity of the workforce that is so important for every aspect of their lives—economic, social and right across the board. So we have targeted the highest rates of subsidies to those on the lowest incomes and more hours of subsidised care for the families who work the most hours. It is a very good reform. I am not sure where the honourable member for Fairfax stands on it but, if he can use his influence with the opposition to supported, that would be a very useful piece of work for him to undertake.
