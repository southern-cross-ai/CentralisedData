        </a>
        are proposing to replace their existing air traffic control systems with the new civil-military air traffic management system being delivered under the OneSKY project to provide a common platform for provision of air traffic control in both civilian- and military-controlled airspace. Australia's OneSKY initiative will bring civilian and military air traffic control together under one air traffic management system for the first time, improving aviation efficiency and safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence air traffic control services are for the purpose of preventing collisions between aircraft, between aircraft and obstructions, between aircraft and vehicles in the ground manoeuvring area, and expediting and maintaining an orderly flow of air traffic within military-controlled airspace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. In its report, the committee has made a number of recommendations in relation to environmental and contamination matters and has requested that Defence work closely with the Hunter Water Corporation and the

       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely and vigorous inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in early 2016 at

        AIR 5428 Phase 1â€”Pilot Training System Facilities Project.

        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct new and refurbished facilities and infrastructure to support the new pilot training system at five RAAF bases across Australia. AIR 5428 Phase 1 is a high priority major capital equipment project that will acquire a new capability for pilot training for all

The proposed works include new and refurbished working and training facilities, including: simulator facilities, flight line shelters, maintenance and storage hangars, aprons and taxiways, live-in accommodation, base infrastructure and amenities in support of the new pilot training system at RAAF Bases East Sale, Pearce, Gingin, Edinburgh and Williamtown.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost to deliver the project is $329.8 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        . This includes: construction costs; escalation allowances; professional service fees; design, construction and defence contingencies; and information technology equipment. This investment will bring economic benefits for the local industries in the impacted regions over the next two to three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is planned to begin in the second half of 2016, with construction completion planned at RAAF Bases East Sale, Pearce and Gingin by mid-2018, and at RAAF Bases Edinburgh and Williamtown in 2019. I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        The Australian Federal Police proposes to undertake a fit-out of its new leased premises at 45 Commercial Road, Newstead, Queensland. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        requires suitable office accommodation to ensure that the AFP is adequately positioned and appropriately resourced to deal with a complex and shifting law enforcement environment. This fit-out is consistent with the objective of the AFP's property plan to provide quality and cost-sustainable buildings and accommodation as a fundamental enabler to the AFP's capabilities and enhancing the AFP's readiness and capacity to carry out organisational responsibilities for law enforcement, investigations and national security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new fit-out will provide the AFP with considerable advantages in terms of design and operating efficiencies. The proposed works include new workstations, offices and meeting areas, laboratories, workshops, a new security system, conference and training facilities, a new communications room and dedicated first aid and interview rooms and amenity areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the fit-out is $25 million, excluding GST, and includes all costs associated with the fit-out such as builders' costs, consultant fees, furniture, fittings and equipment and workstations. This budget includes provisions for contingencies, cost escalation and associated professional fees. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project fit-out is expected to commence in July 2016 and be completed by February 2017. I commend the motion to the House.
