        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Department of Education has written to the principal of every public school in New South Wales stating the Commonwealth budget leaves 'a shortfall from our existing agreement of $1.8 billion'? Is the Prime Minister aware that the email also refers to information sent out by the Commonwealth education minister saying, 'You should not rely on these figures for future planning or budgeting purposes'?

          The honourable member will be aware that, under the Quality Schools package that is part of this budget, government schools in

          will have total funding over 10 years of $31 billion, an 83 per cent increase in funding over 10 years. The question for the honourable member and her colleagues is: do they actually have a schools policy at all? She says she has 27 contradictory and secret deals.

                 We are delivering over the decade a 75 per cent increase in funding. We are delivering for government schools 20 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard right across the nation, because of course for these government schools the primary funder is the state or territory government. For non-government schools, we are delivering 80 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard, adjusted in accordance with their

                 and, of course, added to with loadings for various matters: disabilities, low-socioeconomic background, English as a second language, Indigeneity and so forth. So it is a very thorough model.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The question for the Labor Party is this: if they say more money needs to be expended, are they saying that the federal government should pay a larger share of government schools' costs or of non-government schools' costs?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Are they saying the Schooling Resource Standard is not high enough or the loadings are not high enough? It has got to be one of those.

                    <p>
                     I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that, in his electorate of Banks and in the electorates of all honourable members, there are many parents with children who are disabled who are grateful that at long last the parliament appears to be on the point of honouring the commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and fully funding it. That is what we are doing. The Labor government left the National Disability Insurance Scheme unfunded. We are rising to the challenge and ensuring it is funded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I ask one question for the opposition leader: will Labor support the increase in the Medicare levy to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme? It was only a few years ago, when Labor increased the Medicare levy to partially fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, that the Leader of the Opposition, in a passionate call for bipartisanship, said, 'No-one could be that dumb to put politics before this critical reform.' The question is: will he play politics on this reform? The member for Warringah, at the time the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                      NDIS
                     </a>
                     was announced, as leader of the coalition said, 'This is a reform whose time has come,' and now the time has come to pay for it. The time has come to fund it. The time has come to be fair and honest to all Australians and recognise that we should put the money back in that important policy—that important insurance scheme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It is fair, vitally fair, to be able to say to all Australian school students, 'You will receive Commonwealth funding consistently, fairly and based on needs, totally transparently, with everything disclosed—not with 27 secret deals conflicting with schoolchildren in one part of the country receiving less than children in another but totally transparent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Again, it is fair and honest to fully fund and guarantee Medicare to restore indexation and to create a Medicare Guarantee Fund so that every year from 1 July all Australians will see, in priority, the moneys are placed in that fund to fund Medicare and the PBS. Again, we ask whether the Leader of the Opposition will support that measure. Will he do that? After all, he talks a lot about Medicare. Will he back our fairness, our support, for the NDIS, for a fair schools policy and for the guarantee of Medicare?
