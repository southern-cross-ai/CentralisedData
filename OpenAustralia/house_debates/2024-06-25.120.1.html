        Over the next 20 years, strong housing demand will drive a construction boom in Perth's northern metropolitan coastal corridor, extending north to Yanchep, projected to bring in over 10,000 new residents annually each and every year. By 2046, it is forecasted that 210,000 additional residents will move into our region, placing demands on services including health care, aged care, schools and sporting facilities. I'm committed to working cooperatively with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        and the state government to ensure that all levels of government are working together to plan ahead and implement strategies to meet this projected demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        My focus is on achieving forward-thinking development to support our growing community and enhance our quality of life. I'm working to promote the exciting next phase of the development of Joondalup City Centre, known for its innovation in technology, education and health industries. My priorities include promoting high-quality sustainable, commercial and residential developments, developing a vibrant cultural and entertainment precinct by progressing the Joondalup performing arts convention and exhibition centre and advancing the Joondalup innovation precinct to create highly skilled jobs. I have seen the Joondalup city skyline evolve over the past three decades, and the site of tower cranes in the Joondalup skyline is a most welcome sign of a thriving construction industry backed by private sector investment, economic development and local employment in our regional city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joondalup City Centre is home to a number of development-ready vacant sites which, when developed, will bring much-needed amenity and vibrancy to our central business district. Currently, many businesses in central Joondalup are struggling from a lack of trade and pedestrian traffic due to low population density and sprawling urban development. We must think creatively and plan to get our city moving. Our economic recovery begins locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the many opportunities for development within Joondalup City Centre are several vacant undeveloped lots, some with planning approval, ready to be developed, which offer opportunities for high-quality, environmentally sustainable development of high-rise commercial office space and medium- to high-density residential buildings. For instance, the City of Joondalup is seeking to develop Boas Place, located next to the civic centre in the heart of Joondalup City. The proposed Boas Place development will connect the city's existing civic, cultural, retail, transport, recreation and education elements, transforming these assets into a new precinct containing a vibrant mix of commercial, retail, residential and public spaces and acting as a catalyst to transform Joondalup City Centre. The aim is to activate our city into a livable and vibrant place with amenity.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the north of Joondalup CBD is a significant nine-hectare super lot, at Lot 9000 Mclarty Avenue, which is due for development. It is critical that this site is developed according to the best urban planning principles, as it will influence the vibrancy and livability of the northern part of our city for decades to come. To accelerate the development of Joondalup City North and future growth of the medical precinct surrounding Joondalup hospital, infrastructure funding is urgently needed to upgrade the road network around

        , Moore Drive, Lakeside Drive and

        </a>
        to accommodate the increase in traffic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly make the case in support of the City of Joondalup's submission for increased federal funding towards providing essential infrastructure to facilitate the growth of Joondalup City North. Next week, as part of Local Government Week, I look forward to welcoming a delegation from the City of Joondalup to Canberra, led by Mayor Albert Jacob and the chief executive officer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pearson" rel="nofollow">
         James Pearson
        </a>
        , to build a business case for federal funding. I call upon the minister for infrastructure to favourably consider the City of Joondalup's submissions for federal funding ahead of the upcoming election budget.
