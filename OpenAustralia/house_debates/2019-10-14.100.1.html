         I thank the member for Page for his question, but more importantly for his leadership through some of the darkest hours and days of his region. Tragically, we have seen two lives lost in the recent fires last week. It's a community that has been tormented by fires for some time now, and, with two lives taken, 61 homes destroyed and another 19 damaged, we will have to work with that community in the healing process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and I, along with the Premier and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Deputy Premier

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , visited that community. We put our arms around those brave men and women—those first responders who were there to protect lives and to protect properties and, sadly, the ones who found the fatalities. We need to make sure that those brave Australians heal with us. We will work with the New South Wales government in making sure that our response to the recovery is done as quickly as we possibly can. We've already undertaken initial measures, and, as the fires abate, the New South Wales fire authorities will get additional staff in to make further assessments around what recovery measures we need to make.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal government's already taken steps, particularly around the fact that a sawmill was lost. Thirty to 50 people are now out of a job, because that sawmill was totally destroyed. We immediately put a disaster recovery allowance in place for 13 weeks, but we'll continue to be agile with respect to the response of that community and that business in making sure that their income, their livelihood, is protected for the coming future, until that business is able to recover.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's important to understand that we all have a responsibility to play in this as Australians—at a local level, at a community level and at a national level. It's important we all have a plan around bushfires. No-one is safe from this, particularly those in regional Australia who live in the bush. Out of respect for those brave men and women who are prepared to put their lives on the line for us, it's important that you have an exit for them. You owe it to those brave men and women, many of whom are volunteers, who are prepared to put their lives on the line. Many of those men and women we met yesterday, who we put our arms around yesterday, are shattered not only because of the loss of infrastructure but also because of the loss of life. Let me say to those brave men and women: you have done everything humanly possible in your role; you should be so proud, and this nation owes you a debt of gratitude.

          on indulgence—I join the minister in mourning the death of Gwen Hyde and Bob Lindsey, who lost their lives at their property at Coongbar, just south-west of Casino. Our hearts break for their families, their relatives and their friends. We know that this has had a devastating impact on the community. The

          Over the last few days we've seen some of the worst nature can offer—but also some of the best in human nature.
         </p>
         <p>
          I join with the government in offering whatever support we can provide to assist these families and communities at this quite devastating time.
         </p>
         <p>
          I point out that the Rural Fire Service have also urged those affected to make use of mental health services—and I know that the minister would support this as well—through the Mental Health Line, Lifeline Australia, MensLine Australia, Kids Helpline and

          . As Australians, we are very privileged to live in this country, but it's a difficult country. I pay tribute to all those, particularly those volunteers, who do such an amazing job in times of trauma.
