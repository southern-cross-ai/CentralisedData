       <p>
        I'd like to update the House on a significant business that's in my electorate of Parkes, at Narrabri. The business is called Australian Recycled Plastics, and it was started by Dale and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Helen Smith
        </a>
        back in 2013. Dale and Helen are very successful farmers in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Waa" rel="nofollow">
         Wee Waa
        </a>
        area. They also have a significant trucking company that largely carts cotton to port on behalf of the growers of the Namoi Valley. Dale and Helen recognised that there was a need to establish a new industry, not only for the security of their own family and their own business but also to take advantage of the significant opportunities of recycling.
       </p>
       <p>
        I happened to be there last week to talk to them about a grant that they received through the Recycling Modernisation Fund, a bit over $2 million, to go towards an update of their plant that will enable them to simultaneously separate PET and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDPE" rel="nofollow">
         HDPE
        </a>
        , which will help that facility to actually reach its potential of 9,300 tonnes per annum.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Dale Smith
        </a>
        was telling me that the emphasis on recycling and return and earn in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in particular have improved the quality of the plastics coming through to their plant, but there is still an issue with having to compete with an overseas market. They are struggling at the moment with COVID and the fact that some of this material is making its way overseas. Now, legislation will change that, I think, following the decision that was made that Australia will recycle all its own product.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's significant about where the Smiths are at Narrabri is that their factory is adjacent to the proposed Inland Rail, quite near where the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrabri_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Narrabri Shire Council
        </a>
        intends to build their inland port. Also, probably more importantly, the proposed Santos gas field, which is right on the edge of Narrabri, would provide a source of energy into that plant. What they are doing now, after breaking down the recyclable material, is selling that shredded material or chip material to others to configure. With the advent of gas, they would be able to do a lot of that themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the expenses of recycling is freight. It's bulky but not particularly heavy. So the Inland Rail, which for the first time connects every capital in this country by rail, has the potential not only to help grow their business but also to make Narrabri probably the largest plastic-recycling area in the country. So it is a very, very exciting time. I've got great admiration for people like the Smiths, who see an opportunity, take a risk, invest, work hard, employ local people and actually succeed. I was pleased that Minister Ley was able to support them, through that modernisation fund, so that they can reach their full potential. It wasn't long ago—people in this House would remember—that pretty well all our recyclable materials were sent overseas. Not only was that an expense; it was an opportunity lost for this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that we are becoming more conscious of reusing materials. The recycling industry is an important one. I believe that the drive and innovation shown by Dale and Helen Smith at Narrabri is leading the way in what can be achieved in a regional centre. You don't have to be in a capital city to run a nationally important business. They've shown that. I'm pleased that this government is able to support them to grow their business for the future.
