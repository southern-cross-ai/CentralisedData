        I had the privilege of attending Falls Road Primary Schoolâ€”runner-up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        primary school category for the Anzac Day Schools' Awards. I presented the school with a cheque for $500, a plaque and a certificate at the assembly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Falls Road Primary School has a long-standing tradition of empowering their year 6 students with the honour of hosting the school's Anzac Day service. This year, the students included an Anzac inspired choral reading of Anzac Day and a reflective video of what Anzac Day means to them, as well as a rendition of
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Flanders_Fields" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        During the service, representatives from each year level laid flowers, wreaths or a cross. Every student in the school created a hand print with an Anzac Day message on it, and poppies made by students in year 1 were displayed at the service.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the classroom, year 6 students researched the local servicemen or women, or members of their own family and completed a learning activity 'Who are the ANZACS?' These were displayed during the service, along with artwork, letters home and diary entries written by students. The judges were impressed with the high quality of resources, the variety of activities and the obvious involvement of the whole school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal, Mr David Ingle, and deputy principal, Simon Docherty, along with staff have created a dynamic learning environment for children who attend the Falls Road Primary School. That day I saw a re-enactment of stories and ideas that students had from reading the numerous books that they had available to them. What a wonderful government school.
