        that are storming home to glory this year. Spring has arrived, and many Goldstein sporting clubs have been buzzing with the opening of their seasons. I had the honour of rolling the jack at the Bentleigh Bowling Club season opening only last week. It will be the third season since the completion of the surface upgrade that was done in 2016. When I went to the club only last week, I thought I was the only person who remembered my insufficient bowl of the jack at the opening of the year before. I trained and went to the gym at every opportunity to be able to get a better bowl. Sadly, when I arrived at the club many others remembered that I was short on distance as well. But I'm proud to say that we bowled that jack and started that season with the gusto and thrust that would excite any bowling enthusiast. So I would like to thank those people who organised the opening of the season: president, Ron Gleeson; vice-president,

        I also had the privilege of opening the Brighton Croquet Club and kicked off their season. For 108 years the club has welcomed croquet enthusiasts on its incredible lawns in the middle of Brighton. If you're a beginner looking to get involved, croquet coaching classes will be underway in October—and it's not as easy as it looks, I can tell you. I started with an insufficient and inadequate knock through the first hoops but we got there in the end. I would like to acknowledge: president, Marguerite Russell, who did a wonderful job opening the season and raising the flag; Pam White, club secretary; Juerg Stolz, club treasurer; and Lesley Cavalier, croquet coach. But let's not forget that there is a group of people at any croquet club that deserve particular commendation and that is of course the caterers. The afternoon tea that followed the opening of the season was truly magical, particularly the mushroom soup.

        The Sandringham Bowls Club also started their season, and I'm very honoured to be their patron. Sandy Bowls Club has offered healthy recreation, a social environment and companionship to the community for over a hundred years. So thank you to all the office bearers for their ongoing efforts as part of the opening of the season. I was joined by the Liberal candidate for Sandringham, Brad Rowswell, and of course the retiring member,

        . They joined so many club members who had a wonderful day and incredible weather as well. I want to thank: president, Cathy Spencer; vice-president,

        I would also like to acknowledge Ted Monford, the secretary of the Sandbelt Bowls Region, who was also there for the opening, as was Graeme Ludecke and Matthew Gallop from the Sandringham Community Bank, who do an incredible job in the Goldstein community, supporting so many community projects—and the major sponsor of the club as well as of course Murray Thompson.

        It wasn't just bowls; it's not just croquet; we are coming to the end of the footy season and as the proud co-No. 1 ticket holder of the Old Brighton Grammarians Football Club, we had plenty of success to celebrate yesterday at the victory premiership of the under-19s for the flag for 2018. With the co-No. 1 ticket holder, Felicity Frederico, we presented the cup. So congratulations to the premiership players, Tom Wallace and Max Burtfor, polling highly in the league's best and fairest.

        Last Friday we had a Goldstein community morning tea where we honoured many people who have given wonderful service to our community and people who got Queens birthday honours: Clair Seoud, who hosted a one-hour radio program on local community station Southern
