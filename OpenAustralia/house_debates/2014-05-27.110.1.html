        Gilmore is filled with generous and compassionate people, where individuals and community groups create all manner of opportunities to build up funds for special causes or families impacted by tragedy or illness. It is my belief that when times are tough we should all work together to help one another, to be positive about events. Our local media does not always have that philosophy, focusing on the negative rather than the positive. It is time to challenge the local media to look at community achievement as a glass half-full situation rather than a glass half-empty situation.

        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        Society is celebrating 100 years of service in the area. The challenge is to have 100 days of good news about the community. At the end of that time a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine will be auctioned for the local Red Cross. The aim is to add funds to their learn-to-drive scheme for youth. It will not be hard for editors and journalists; they actually miss dozens of opportunities to recognize great work done in the Gilmore community.

        Some recent examples include the evening of 17 May at the St Georges Basin Country Club, well known for fundraisers, where I attended their Staff and Friends Charity Night. The original concept was a creative plan developed back in 2003. Lorraine Robertson and June Woods came up with the idea of staff at their place of employment raising funds for local charities. The performers are a blend of enthusiastic staff members mixing with local professionals donating their time to present a night of fun and high-quality entertainment. So far they have hosted seven shows.

        At least a dozen amateurs from the staff work under the guidance of Lorraine and June, with the expertise of Simon and Serenity Pavitt, professional singers who entertain for a living. After three months rehearsing, the resulting show is four hours on stage. Over the years they have raised funds for Barnardos,

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Starlight Foundation
        </a>
        , but always for children's charities. This year the Illawarra based Shepherd Centre is the recipient. The centre has been set up to assist children who are deaf or hearing-impaired. Its aim is to help parents discover more about learning for their children. Hayley, 22 months old, is a local girl selected as the face of the Shepherd Centre. She is profoundly deaf, but her sparkling shoes tapped cross the dance floor as she felt the rhythm of the music. About 350 people gathered in the auditorium and, after the local taekwondo club completed a musical demonstration of their craft, the audience was asked to assist their efforts. They hope to attend the world championships in Italy, representing Australia. Everyone opened purses and wallets to help. The media was missing.

        Another was the National Motoring Heritage Day in Berry, with the organisers giving out medals to car enthusiasts who had lovingly restored their vehicles. The media was absent. Yet one of the local miracle workers, Michael, a former limousine maker, had produced a replica

        Then, last Friday night, Melissa Tierney presented her fifth Creative Performance Evening by Those With a Disability. Melissa is a wonderful advocate for these young people. You cannot imagine the smiles and looks of joy on the faces of these wonderful performers, following along with the dance team instructors. The performance from

        brought tears to your eyes, and almost all this work is done with the support of parents and friends. Dexter Heffernan, just three years of age, in the arms of his amazing mother, was featured in one of the musical acts. Dexter is extraordinary. Born nine weeks too early, his life has been a series of challenges, and his mother is an absolute angel. During his initial hospital stay, he was diagnosed with brain damage caused by periventricular leukomalacia. He was later diagnosed with vision impairment and, shortly after that, the specialist found a form of liver cancer, requiring chemotherapy. It was clear that he enjoyed every minute of his time on stage.

        Finally, on Saturday, 24 May, the Berry Celtic Festival again celebrated many different Celtic clans. This year, the festival featured the Welsh Celts, especially relevant as this is the 100th year of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         Dylan Thomas
        </a>
        . The funds raised were for Can Assist. The festival is coordinated by the Gerringong and Berry Rotary clubs with assistance from other clubs, such as South Nowra, helping on the gate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following this was the culmination of yet another great community project. A local landowner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce McDonald
        </a>
        , donated a block of land; a local building company,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJ" rel="nofollow">
         GJ
        </a>
        Gardner, built a house; and, on Saturday, the GJ Variety Freedom House was auctioned by Brian Muller, raising well over $200,000 towards the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Not all of these special events were ignored by the media, but it is time for them to look beyond the large projects and acknowledge the work of small community groups and individuals. Let us help everyone to shine, to do their best, and acknowledge them. It is about building a community and working together. In 100 days, the Gilmore community will be the richer for a more positive slant in reporting. The community groups are looking forward to a change. They know that communities need building of recognition, rather than continuous reporting or features on depressing or tragic stories, with negative commentary. Is the local media up to the challenge, and will the auction eventuate? I just wonder.
