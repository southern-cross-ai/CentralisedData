        My question is also to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on action the government is taking to ensure that energy is affordable and reliable for households and businesses, including in my electorate of

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is delivering on the issues that matter most to the Australian people: energy prices, jobs, economic growth and national security. So, while the opposition have spent the past fortnight talking up their plans to try to make the House of Representatives appear chaotic, what we have done is stayed focused squarely on the issues that matter to Australian families and businesses. And we're delivering measure after measure that is putting downward pressure on energy prices. Our commitment, our focus, is on affordable and reliable energy—and we know because our policies are driven by engineering and economics. That is why we can be sure, and Australians can be sure, with a practical, commonsense approach to energy policy, that prices will be lower.

        <p>
         Now, regrettably, we've seen today another report highlighting the failure of Labor's experiments with energy. The

          Australian Energy Market Operator

         has released its
         <i>
          Electricity Statement of Opportunities
         </i>
         , its annual stocktake of what is needed to ensure that Australians get the electricity they need affordably and reliably. What it shows is a sorry tale of Labor mismanagement, particularly in

          South Australia
         </a>
         and in Victoria. It's left our national electricity market vulnerable. It confirms that, in those states, they'll need to put in costly backup arrangements—

           including diesel generators, to secure supply. The likelihood of a shortfall and load shedding to keep the power on is between 39 per cent and 43 per cent in Victoria and 26 per cent and 33 per cent in

           has had to put in place its own emergency measures to stop this from happening.
          </p>
          <p>
           AEMO has measures in place to cover the immediate gap, but it once again highlights that we cannot risk another one of Labor's big energy experiments; the Australian people, families and businesses, simply can't afford it. The report also warns that, on top of the immediate risk, there will be more pressure in 2022, when the Liddell power station is due to close. The energy minister and I are already in discussions with the owner of Liddell,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGL" rel="nofollow">
            AGL
           </a>
           , about how we can ensure that that power station stays in operation for at least another five years after 2022. How has the Labor Victorian government responded to this crisis? More of the same mistakes, calling for more renewables with no backup. It's not just ideology and politics on their side; it's ideology and idiocy.
