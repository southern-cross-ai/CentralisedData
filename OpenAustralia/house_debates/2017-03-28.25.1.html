       <p>
        I want to acknowledge and thank Colin and Teresa Brand, the principal and deputy principal of Harvey Primary School, for the last 12 years of their work. Colin's motto throughout his time has always been, 'Kids come first: if it's good for kids, it's worthwhile doing.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The school received from the director-general the excellence in education award after completing an educational review of the school. Mr Brand said very few schools receive this award. The school also received: the WA Primary School of the Year runner-up; the

        Award for indigenous attendance in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other achievements include: the development and establishment of the digital technologies program throughout the school; the strong emphasis on bringing the school community together in establishing the outdoor classroom and quiet garden area; the building and maintenance of the earth cage facility at the school; developing strong winds with Alcoa, the

        and service groups; the organisation and coordination of four Canberra tours since 2009, providing an opportunity for over 240 students from Harvey. There has been enormous support and guidance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deputy Principal Teresa Brand has driven the virtues program at the school, driving a strong culture. She has had a strong role in establishing attendance processes that have been recognised throughout the state. Her role in guiding the student leaders in a tireless approach to the management of student services cannot be undervalued.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank them both and wish them all the best in their new school in Esperance. Twelve years of great work!
