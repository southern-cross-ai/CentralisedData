        The days between sitting weeks are extraordinary. There is a complete whirlwind of events to attend, to catch up on community connections, and last weekend the youth of Gilmore showed their true colours. On Friday morning, I met about 90 young ladies in the hall of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">
         St John
        </a>
        the Evangelist Catholic High School. Some had to be encouraged to find a place in the front seats. Most had come completely unaware of the theme of the presentation. I introduced the idea of leadership using a 'guess the leader' form and trigger words about leadership styles. At the end, I asked each one to look at the reflective square they had been given. What did they see? They saw themselves, but more than that: I suggested to them that they were looking at potential leaders, whatever life choice they were about to take. After this, I had a quick coffee and meeting with one of the Work for the Dole coordinators, Trudy Commins, an enthusiastic and dedicated young worker, discussing their effective program transitioning young people into work. Following that, I attended the Milton-Ulladulla women's conference where Petrea King outlined the need for balance, wellness, openness and happiness, and the need to not wait for any of these but to jump in right now, boots and all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saturday morning I returned to Ulladulla to speak at the Celebrating Cultural Diversity Festival. Noel Butler and his group did a fabulous welcome to country; then the young and the young at heart trailed two sets of international flags I had brought. It was great to see children from Ethiopia and the Philippines and our local children all carrying the flags together.
       </p>

        Later was the Kidzfix pasta, plonk and poetry fundraiserâ€”although not necessarily in that order! Congratulations to the committee, particularly Penny and Cam Stevens, Leanne and Kevin Stuart, and Tony and Ria Emery. They work tirelessly, with absolutely nothing but great intentions, to help sick children get better. After that was the Nowra-Culburra Surf Lifesaving Club presentation night, which was, as always, great fun. Mitch Paykes and Col Lawrence are great, encouraging a terrific group of young surf-lifesavers.

        Sunday found me collecting for the Salvos outside one of our local

        . I met Mick, sitting in a wheelchair, a beautiful soul: intelligent, compassionate and very special. There were many generous people that day, some who clearly did not have a great deal of money but gave whatever they could. It was very heart warming.
       </p>
       <p>
        After that there was a great, positive meeting with some inspiring young members of the Culburra community. I initially spoke with Tom, Tyson and Josh about their ideas; and then I met the dynamic group of skaters Daniel, Leon, Matt, Ryan, Luke, Max, Hamish and Tenaya, along with parents Lisa and John, who discussed how we could galvanise other young people and the community at large to support them in their quest to build a skate park. They are ready for petitioning, presenting to the community progress association and getting a fundraiser happening. Their energy is great to see, and we will all work together to achieve the skate park.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to all these wonderful young people I met over the weekend, showing Gilmore has gutsy, gold-quality youth working and volunteering to make our region better.
