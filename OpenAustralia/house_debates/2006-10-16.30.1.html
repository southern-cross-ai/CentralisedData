        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister outline to the House how freedom of choice has been embraced by Australian workers? Is he aware of plans to roll back freedom of choice in the workplace?

         I think it is fair to say that freedom of choice is a golden thread that runs through the policies of the coalition. Of all the freedoms to which this side of politics is strongly committed, none is more important than the freedom of a man or a woman in this country to join or not to join a trade union. We believe that if you want to join a union you should be able to do so without penalty, but if you do not want to join a union you should be able to stay out of the union without penalty.

         Not only was the Leader of the Opposition forced into the humiliation of having a news conference in a park because he could not have the news conference in the conference hall but then some of the delegates got up and tried to reverse the policy, and the motion to reverse the policy was defeated on the floor of the conference. The image of the Leader of the Opposition in that park gave me a smidgen of a reminder of one of the most famous photographs in Australian political history, and that was

         The Leader of the Opposition pathetically bowed to a ban on the right of people to join or not to join a union. Instead of saying to the ALP conference in South Australia, ‘You change this stupid rule in the name of freedom of choice,’ he pathetically went along with it. When he was asked about it, he said, ‘It’s really got nothing to do with me; it’s got everything to do with the state conference.’ Here is a man who wants to be the Prime Minister of Australia but who cannot say boo to the South Australian ALP. I think it is a pathetic example of exactly what life would be like under a future Labor government. Greg Combet said it all when he said, ‘The unions used to run Australia and it wouldn’t be a bad idea if they did again.’ It is pretty clear that the unions run the Leader of the Opposition. It is our job to make sure they do not end up running Australia.
