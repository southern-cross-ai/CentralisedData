        I rise today to pay tribute to one of Camden's oldest and most loved residents, Ina Cameron, who passed away on 13 November after a short illness, aged 105â€”yes, 105. Mrs Cameron was well known in my community. She and her husband, Gordon, ran menswear stores in Camden and Campbelltown after moving to Camden in 1946. Since then, she has worked in the canteen at the Inglis saleyards, raising money for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the hospital auxiliary. She was a member of the Torchbearers for Legacy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        and the Church of England Women's Guild at

         St Mark's Church
        </a>
        . Mrs Cameron also worked as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Lady" rel="nofollow">
         Pink Lady
        </a>
        at Carrington for many years. She was an enthusiastic volunteer and a member of a huge number of community groups and organisations, who will sorely miss her.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community farewelled Mrs Cameron with a service at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Church" rel="nofollow">
         St Paul's Church
        </a>
        in Cobbitty. Her niece, Camden councillor Eva Campbell, has remembered her aunt as a woman of 'quiet understated elegance'. She said Mrs Cameron was friendly and her whole life revolved around her family and friends and the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met Mrs Cameron a couple of years ago when I was volunteering for the day with Camden Meals on Wheels. Mrs Cameron was a delight to spend time with. She was very kind and witty and had many stories to tell of years gone by in the Camden area. She was very politically astute and was known as Australia's oldest swinging voter, who had selected the winner of every state and federal election she had voted in. She was a great asset to our community and will be dearly missed by all those who knew her. She was truly a wonderful woman, loved and cherished by all. Rest in peace, Ina. You will be missed.
