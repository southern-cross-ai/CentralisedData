       <p>
        Today I speak about a petition I have received from the Edmund Rice Centre for justice and community education. The Edmund Rice Centre is a non-government organisation located in Homebush, in my electorate of Lowe. Under the directorship of Mr Phil Glendenning, the centre has championed a number of noble and worthy causes including the pursuit of reconciliation with our Indigenous brothers and sisters, the promotion of business ethics and more compassionate policies towards asylum seekers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I wish to draw to the attention of the House the work currently being undertaken by the Edmund Rice Centre in relation to climate change. In a recent meeting with representatives of the centre I was presented with a petition calling for very strong and effective climate change action. The centre collected over 800 signatures in just four weeks. Organiser Leonie Cornell notes that the high number of signatures collected in such a short period of time from local families, businesses and churchgoers reflects the views of many of my constituents and those from neighbouring electorates. It is clear that the men and women who have signed this petition want the government to show leadership and take action to address the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Further, the hardworking staff and volunteers of the Edmund Rice Centre firmly reject the defeatist and negligent attitude espoused by many members of the opposition that Australia needs to wait and see what the rest of the world does.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre calls on the Australian government to take a leadership role at the negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen. The centre has reported that without strong, effective global action our planet is in dire straits. It notes that a rise in global temperatures will be catastrophic for the lifestyles and welfare of many millions of people. This in turn, it notes, will be catastrophic for the world economy. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on

        , Environment, Water and the Arts, which released the report
        <i>
         Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate
        </i>
        in October, I clearly understand the damaging impacts that rising sea levels and storm surges could have on low-lying coastal zones in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Edmund Rice Centre is a member of the Pacific Calling Partnership. The Pacific Calling Partnership was formed in 2006 as a response to calls from communities in low-lying Pacific islands such as Kiribati. The partnership draws together a number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s, community organisations, school groups and individuals and aims to raise awareness about the impacts of high greenhouse gas emissions on their island nations. Members of the Pacific Calling Partnership will form a delegation attending the Copenhagen summit next month. Mr Glendenning will be part of this delegation. I am very pleased to note that the director of a non-government organisation located within my electorate will play a role alongside world leaders at the Copenhagen conference. Some international leaders would do very well to listen to the views and concerns of Mr Glendenning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian community want action on climate change. Our island neighbours want action on climate change. Let us show some national leadership and take action. I seek leave to table this petition on behalf of the Edmund Rice Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
