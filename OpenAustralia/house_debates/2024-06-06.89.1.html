        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, it's obvious the government doesn't want a gambling advertising ban because it's scared of a backlash from the media and big sporting codes and doesn't want to lose donations from the gambling companies. But this is at entirely at odds with community expectations and what a parliamentary inquiry unanimously recommended a year ago. So why don't you do your job and ban the advertising? Why don't you get it done?

         I thank the member for Clark for his question. What we are doing is taking action. We've launched BetStop, the national self-exclusion register, we've mandated customary preverification for all new online wagering accounts to prevent kids from gambling, and we've strengthened protections for Australians who've registered for BetStop. We've agreed with states and territories on new minimum classification for video games with gambling-like content. We've introduced nationally consistent staff training. We've implemented new evidence based taglines to replace the former 'Gamble responsibly'.

          Order! Member for Clark, the Prime Minister was asked about the issue and what he is doing about the issue. He is specifically reading into the
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          and to the House exactly what he was asked about. You may not like the answer or be happy about what's in the answer, and it may not be addressing what you'd like to be in the answer, but, if you're going to get up and raise a point on relevance just because of that, that's not how the standing orders work. The member's been here long enough to understand that. But, out of respect to him, I will take the point of order.

           Thank you, Speaker. On relevance: the question was very specific. It only went to the issue of gambling advertising.

            The Prime Minister is addressing exactly the topic and the committee report involving the issue. So we've got to get everyone understanding that, when an answer is directly relevant about the topic that a minister, including the Prime Minister, was asked about, and it's not answered in exactly the way you want, that is not an excuse to simply rise to your feet and say, 'I don't like the answer; I want it to be more specific.' It is happening more and more all the time. Under the standing orders, I simply don't have that, and it is disorderly. So, if it continues, I will have to take action in relation to all members. The Prime Minister has the call.

            <p>
             Thanks, Mr Speaker. I'm going through the actions that we are taking.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_advertising" rel="nofollow">
              Gambling advertising
             </a>
             is about getting people to gamble. That's what it's about, and I'm going through the measures that we have put in place already. We have legislated a ban on the use of credit cards for gambling, which is a major issue and a source of grief out there in the community. That certainly was something that was considered by the committee when it was developing its report. We've also required online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements outlining wins and losses.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government is continuing to examine further issues and what more can be done, including further restrictions on gambling advertising, but it's not much good if you're shutting down an ad in one place only for it to pop up somewhere else. The truth is that these issues are complex because people in 2024 don't just have televisions or radios; they carry with them devices where ads can pop up and appear and where people can get access not just from Australia but from overseas as well without any controls whatsoever because of the nature of the accounts, the nature of those devices and the nature of the way that the internet operates with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPN" rel="nofollow">
              VPN
             </a>
             s. So we want to make sure that any measures that are taken actually can deliver on the outcome that we want. We want people to not engage in gambling in a way that damages families and causes harm and addiction, because we know that that can have a devastating impact on the community. But we do want to make sure that any measures are got right, and that's why I would encourage the member to continue to work with the government on these issues to make sure that indeed we do get it right.
