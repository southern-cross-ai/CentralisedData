        Last week I met with Ron Trigwell, Secretary of the

        n Pilots and Escort Drivers Association, where I was made aware of a number of issues confronting that industry. There are around 800 pilot drivers in Western Australia and an average of 600 in each state and territory in this country. Each driver travels an average of 180,000 kilometres a year, escorting oversized loads along the national highways in built-up areas for the safety of other motorists and the general public. These drivers are self-employed and many of them are retirees. They provide a great community service and, should they not exist, escorts would have to come from the already underresourced police departments of states and territories.

       <p>
        Pilot drivers are not entitled to fuel rebates. While heavy vehicle owners and drivers receive a rebate, the people who are escorting these vehicles on exactly the same journey, for exactly the same time, receive no rebate or incentive, whilst providing a public safety service. They are ineligible for the rebate because their vehicles weigh less than 4Â½ tonnes. Additionally, pilot drivers are exempt from the rebates for conversion to

        , as their vehicles are being used for commercial purposes. With the cost of fuel at record highs, that is an expensive operation. It becomes even more difficult if the driver travels, for instance, from Perth to Brisbane and there is no return job, because they have to pay for the journey at their own expense. The inconsistency in laws regulating the industry throughout the states and territories is another hurdle that needs to be overcome. (
