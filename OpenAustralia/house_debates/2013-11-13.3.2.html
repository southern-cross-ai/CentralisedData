       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that the Prime Minister committed to lead a Government which is transparent and open and the Coalition's Real Solutions platform stated that the Coalition would "restore accountability and improve transparency measures";
       </p>

        (b) the Leader of the House on 30 January 2013 committed himself to a parliamentary practice in Government to "allow any Member of any political party who has serious questions to answer, time to explain themselves through the Parliament to the Australian people"; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration have adopted a new culture of secrecy and are hiding information from the Australian people. The Minister has repeatedly refused to answer questions at weekly Operation Sovereign Borders briefings. That failure to answer questions has led the Australian people to rely on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Post" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for information about their own Government. Questions remain relating to attempted so-called turn backs of boats, buy back of boats and to the state of negotiations between Australia and Indonesia about a people swap arrangement with Indonesia; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) calls on the Minister for Immigration to attend the House immediately and explain for a period not exceeding thirty minutes:

        (b) how the Government intends to pursue its election commitment to turn back boats to Indonesia and buy back boats in fishing villages; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) whether any of the measures which have been effective in reducing the flow of asylum seeker vessels to Australia are now in jeopardy as a result of the Minister's chaotic handling of his portfolio including the Regional Resettlement Arrangements with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

        The minister who was the star of the Liberal Party in opposition has become the embarrassment of the government. We are about to see where secrecy and transparency lead us when they come to power.

                    The reason standing orders should not be suspended on this occasion is that the coalition won the election two months ago and today we want to introduce the carbon tax repeal bills. On the draft daily program, the carbon tax repeal bills are listed for debate. Labor has demonstrated for the last 20 minutes that they will do anything to stand in the way of lowering electricity prices in this country. 'Electricity Bill' Shorten, as his first political act in the parliament, has desired to get his Manager of Opposition Business to block the repeal of the carbon tax.

                           The reason standing orders should not be suspended is that the Australian public expects this government to get on with its program. That is why the Australian public elected 90 members of the coalition on 7 September—to repeal the carbon tax. The draft daily program lists the carbon tax repeal bills as the first item of business, not parliamentary stunts.

                                It is very clear that the Manager of Opposition Business does not know his standing orders. While slightly irrelevant to the debate, the Leader of the Opposition should have stuck with the member for Grayndler, who is now trying to help him in this rather embarrassing display of ineptitude on the part of the Opposition. He now has the answer; he now has the standing order number.
