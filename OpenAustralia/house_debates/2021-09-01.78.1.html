        My question is to the Prime Minister. Rachel, in my electorate, is 24-weeks pregnant. She cannot get an appointment for the vaccine recommended for her until 2 November. She's on the waitlist at five
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        clinics and was turned away when she tried to get a vaccination at a walk-in clinic. In Newcastle another pregnant woman, just like Rachel, is in intensive care with COVID. How could the Prime Minister leave pregnant women so vulnerable?

         Whilst I don't have Rachel's details, I'd be very happy to receive them and to see if we could assist in some way, shape or form. We are aware of the other case to which the member refers, and we are seeking details from New South Wales Health at this stage. I've not received them, but I have requested them.

         In terms of vaccination for women who are pregnant, on 9 June 2021 the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation—ATAGI, as it's well known—in conjunction with the Royal Australian and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_College" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand College
         </a>
         of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RANZCOG, issued a joint statement recommending that pregnant women are routinely offered Pfizer mRNA vaccine at any stage of pregnancy. From a Commonwealth perspective they have been prioritised through that period, and we have been encouraging general practices, Commonwealth vaccination clinics and state clinics in order to provide that support.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know there are over 8½ thousand primary care vaccination sites across the country, and approximately 200 are in the Hunter region, as the member would be aware. This includes 110 general practices, two Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         community controlled health services and over 70 community pharmacies. In particular, 50 of those general practices have had early access to Pfizer in the Hunter region, and we would be happy to assist in either of those cases. We continue to encourage all practices to provide priority to pregnant women, in line with the advice of ATAGI as issued on 9 June.
