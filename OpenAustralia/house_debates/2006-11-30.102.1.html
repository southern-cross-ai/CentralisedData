        I commend the previous speaker, the member for Scullin, for his strong support of the Howard government’s Community Water Grants program. I am glad that the member for Scullin recognises the importance of the Howard government’s Community Water Grants program. This program was introduced by this government—for the first time by any government—to provide grants at the community level to organisations so they can save and reuse water. It was only two weeks ago that I spoke in the adjournment debate about the wonderful work that was being done at the Croydon Hills Primary School in my electorate, where they have received a community water grant to install rainwater tanks and a number of other water-saving devices which will save the school two million litres of water. Of course, the reason that program has been able to be introduced by the Howard government—and the electors of Scullin for the very first time can have community water grants, which did not occur under the Keating or Hawke governments—is that we have the resources and the financial ability to fund such programs. Having paid off $96 billion worth of Labor’s debt, we now have the opportunity through the interest saving on that debt—around $8 billion every year—to increase funding for all sorts of important community priorities, be they health, education or important grants programs such as this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another grants program I would like to commend today is the Volunteer Small Equipment Grants Program. It is a vital program that provides small grants of up to a few thousand dollars to help communities do their job for the benefit of our local society. In my electorate, numerous environmental groups have received community grants that have recognised the important role they play on the ground. Of course, in a partnership between government and community groups, we very much rely on the work that they do. In the recent allocation round, there were a number of successful applicants. I would like to mention them, what they received the grants for and the great work they do.

        The Croydon North Cricket Club received a grant for some sunshades, a marquee and an umbrella. That cricket club engages in a number of charitable activities, most notably an

        s. I also recognise the Joy Avenue Preschool in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which received a grant for all sorts of equipment, particularly garden equipment. I recognise the Help for Wildlife group in Gruyere, which does so much good work for the local community there. They have received funding for a camera and video projection equipment. The Lilydale softball club received funding of $2,700 for computer software. The Mount Evelyn Primary School Parents Association also received funding for sunshades, umbrellas and other equipment for the primary school. The Patch Early Learning Centre also received funding for computer software.

        These are just some of the grants that have been successful. I pay tribute to all of those community groups. We can, as a federal government, assist them with a small grant, but of course the hours of work that volunteers put into those organisations make all of our local electorates much better places. I pay tribute to them and commend the program.
