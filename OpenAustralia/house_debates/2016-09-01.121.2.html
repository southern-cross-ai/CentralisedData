       <p>
        I just want to make a quick statement, which I had anticipated making just before the adjournment—before other events intervened—to recognise the renowned contribution to architecture in Australia and internationally of the esteemed architect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaldo_Giurgola" rel="nofollow">
         Romaldo Giurgola
        </a>
        , who died earlier this year in here in Canberra on 16 May 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Giurgola was the principal design architect of Australia's Parliament House from its inception in 1983 to its opening in 1988. The firm of Mitchell, Giurgola &amp; Thorp won the international design competition from 329 entries. In recognition of his work on Parliament House, Mr Giurgola received the Royal Australian Institute of Architects' gold medal in 1988 and was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in 1989. He also received numerous other honours and awards throughout his life in Australia and internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, together with the President of the Senate and Mr Giurgola's international and national colleagues and friends, I attended a gathering in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        of Parliament House to celebrate his life and his contribution to architecture. The gathering included numerous presentations about his work in Australia and internationally and was a fitting tribute to a truly great man and architect.
       </p>
       <p>
        I—along with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_President" rel="nofollow">
         Senate President
        </a>
        —was pleased to meet with Mr Giurgola when he came to Parliament House late last year for a morning tea to honour his 95th birthday. I acknowledge Mr Giurgola as not only an exceptional architect of Parliament House but one who, along with a great team of architects, helped to make the
