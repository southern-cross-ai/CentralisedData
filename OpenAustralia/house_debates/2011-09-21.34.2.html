        It has been many months since the devastating floods which caused so much heartache in the electorate of Ryan, and we have worked very hard to bring some semblance of normality back to our community. We have watched the vegetation regrow, we have watched the council repair the roads and we have watched the rubbish cleared away. We have delighted as our neighbours have begun to rejoin communities and move back into their homes. Sadly, not all of our neighbours are doing so well, and the coming of the new season seems a good time to remind ourselves that there are still friends in need and work to be done.

        I commend the efforts of the volunteers and businesses, including Westpac, who donated money, time and resources to support our community for a successful and happy event.
