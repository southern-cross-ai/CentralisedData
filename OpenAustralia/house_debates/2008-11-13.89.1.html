       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge Dripstone Middle School in my electorate of Solomon for the fantastic efforts it makes on an annual basis in raising money for cancer research. My niece, Christina Francis, is a year 9 student at the school and I asked her to make a contribution to this speech, so it would be remiss of me to claim credit for what she has put on paper. I will read out what she sent me:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Dripstone Middle School’s motto is ‘A Community of Achievers’ they live up to their motto in academic, sporting and cultural achievement, as well as being very active in the community.
        </li>
        <li>
         Dripstone staff and students believe that it is important to raise much needed funds for various charities.
        </li>
        <li>
         This fundraising has been part of Dripstone life for at least twenty years.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In 2007 the students of this middle school raised over $3,000.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         $200 for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_International" rel="nofollow">
          Humane Society International
         </a>
         ,
        </li>
        <li>
         $2 629 for the Bone Marrow Donor Institute and
        </li>
        <li>
         $243 for the Starlight Children’s Foundation—
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        as well as taking part in the ‘Relay for Life’, where they raised over $4,000. She continued:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Over the years they have been sponsoring a little boy named Connor who has eye cancer and have raised thousands of dollars for him.
        </li>
        <li>
         Every year on Dripstone Day they have a ‘Crop and Colour’ activity and the money raised goes to the Bone Marrow Donor Institute.
        </li>
        <li>
         Since its inception, ‘Crop and Colour’ has raised around $30,000 for various charities.
        </li>
        <li>
         In 2008 Dripstone has again taken part in ‘Relay for Life’ and expanded their range of charities, to include the ‘
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPCA" rel="nofollow">
          RSPCA
         </a>
         ’.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Relay for Life was once again held at Gardens Oval recently and it was again a huge success.
        </li>
        <li>
         43 teams raised $182,000 with more cash expected to roll in over the coming weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
         This is a record amount of money raised and was very welcomed by the organisers and the

         Helen Smith.

        <li>
         ‘We had more cancer survivors’ walk than we’ve ever had’ Ms Smith said. ‘And that’s what it is all about ‘She added.
        </li>
        <li>
         Dripstone has a strong sense of community and enjoys taking part in community activities.
        </li>
        <li>
         The students are enthusiastic and keen to make a difference in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
         Students are encouraged to take part in Wednesday Afternoon Activities.
        </li>
        <li>
         These activities include The Dukes Mob where participants have the opportunity to interact with elderly members of the Darwin community.
        </li>
        <li>
         The students also partake in a leadership program that helps them to be more active in their community.
        </li>
        <li>
         I believe that Dripstone Middle School is committed to keeping up their community achievements and will be a valuable asset to the community for years to come.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        I thank Christina for her contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the many fabulous people who perform as carers in our community. A couple of weeks back we as a nation celebrated Carers Week. Carers make a fantastic contribution to our community; they are the unsung heroes of Australia. Carers are selfless givers to us, selfless givers to our community and selfless givers to the people they provide care to. I encourage all Australians: whenever you see a person with a disability, go and introduce yourself to them. Then turn to the person who is with them and ask if they are their carer. If they are, thank them. Tell them that we appreciate what they do and that they do a fantastic job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the comments of our Prime Minister, who while opening National Carers Week said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The great thing about what you are doing here is giving a truly personal dimension to what is an extraordinary national story.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The story of carers in our country is a narrative about Australia itself, it’s a narrative also about those who provide that care individually and each story is different.
       </p>
       <p>
        One statistic I found amazing is that around five per cent of Australians under the age of 25—that is, 350,000 young people—provide care for another person. Furthermore, 170,000 young carers are under the age of 18 and among these the average age is 12 to 13. These are great young kids who are trying to juggle their study, their work and their caring responsibilities every single day—outstanding. On 8 December carers will be rewarded for their tireless efforts when they receive a one-off payment of $1,000. This will be a welcome payment for the some 400,000 Australians who receive the carers allowance.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, congratulations to everyone in our community who works tirelessly to help others. Whether you are a carer, a fundraiser for research into illnesses or someone who always kicks the tin and donates, your efforts are appreciated. It is this community engagement, this willingness to lend a helping hand and this compassion and care that unite communities and build a better society.
