        I rise in the House today to speak about the success of Tasmanian cyclist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Porte" rel="nofollow">
         Richie Porte
        </a>
        . The former Launcestonian and Sky team rider will on Saturday embark on the world's biggest sporting event: the 2013 Tour de France. This exciting event proves beneficial to the advancement of Porte's career as it has been identified as a doorway to greater opportunities with his team. Although he will play a supporting role in the event, Porte's continued success and excellent performances in his professional career so far have cemented his place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Sky" rel="nofollow">
         Team Sky
        </a>
        . This is highlighted by an impressive confirmation that Porte is to lead his team in the Giro d'Italia next year, emphasising the strong future his team envisages for him in fulfilling his aspirations to take on a leadership role.
       </p>
       <p>
        Embracing each and every opportunity to lead his team, Porte has shown his dedication and commitment to the sport and his team by utilising his lead rider status to the best of his abilities in the shorter races last year. In doing so, he was able to deliver an overall win in France and a second place in Spain. Taking up road cycling at 21, Porte has quickly become an accomplished world-class athlete. We wish him all the best for his future. This is a great Tasmanian from the great electorate of Bass.
