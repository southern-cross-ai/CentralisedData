        Last weekend I attended the Darwin Malayalee Association fundraiser, raising money for the victims of the devastating floods in Kerala in southern India. My family proudly donated to this important cause. I want to acknowledge the great work of the Darwin Malayalee Association, along with the Darwin Malayalee Forum, Tatvamasi,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro_Malabar" rel="nofollow">

        community, the Jacobite orthodox community, the Darwin Strikers Soccer Club and others, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS" rel="nofollow">

        Spices in Nakara and many others, who collected or donated money for the victims of the floods.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would especially like to acknowledge the contributions of the president, Rajeev Thayil, and Salas Abraham from the Darwin Malayalee Association and thank all the performers and volunteers who made the night such a great success. I want to thank Shyju, Jomon, Binu Paikadan, Matthew Mattam, Monsi Thomas, Robin Mathew, Sanju, Shajahan, Baby Abraham,

        and all the families who prepared such delicious food for the evening. I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the Malayalee community to Darwin and Palmerston in my electorate. Many members here probably don't realise that in

        about 50 per cent of the nurses are from the Malayalee community.

        The flooding in Kerala, the worst in the area since 1924, has claimed close to 500 lives, with another 50 missing, while close to one million persons have been displaced. Kerala is a state with a population of around 35 million people, and its state government estimates that at least one-sixth of the total population of Kerala has been directly affected by the flooding and related incidents. The heartbreak suffered by the people of Kerala is exacerbated by the fact that this tragedy occurred at a time when they normally come together to celebrate the Hindu festival of Onam, an important celebration offering thanks for a great harvest. It's a situation that I know many of us have been monitoring closely. Many people in Darwin and Palmerston have been personally affected by the tragedy. I want to thank Dr Edwin Joseph and acknowledge his work with the Indian community and many organisations and committees in Darwin. He is a tireless community worker.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to remind everyone back in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        that if you've been affected by the flooding in Kerala—I know of someone who has been—my office is available to help in any way we can. God bless all those affected. You are not only in our thoughts and prayers; you are backed by our actions.
