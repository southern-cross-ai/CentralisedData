            <p>
             We were left, of course, with a massive skills deficit. Wherever you looked across the economy, whether it was the care sector,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
              IT
             </a>
             or traditional trades, there were skills shortages across the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
             For that reason, it was critical that we moved very quickly and struck agreements with all state and territory governments to deliver, for this year, 180,000 fee-free
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
              TAFE
             </a>
             and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
              VET
             </a>
             places. And that's what we've done. We've reached agreement with all governments—something that the previous government could not do—to supply the skills to the economy that are in demand.
            </p>
            <p>
             That has been, of course, an absolutely vital thing for businesses that are crying out for skills they are in need of and for workers that need the skills that are in demand so that they can have secure employment, a decent career progression and decent wages. That's why it's so important that we supply the skills that are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Enrolment for TAFEs and VET providers is still open. I call upon those people that are interested in entering into courses for skills that are in demand to do so, providing opportunities for their employment and providing skills that businesses need. I think it would be a wonderful thing for them to consider doing. There is no doubt that it is important to get qualifications past secondary school. Nine out of every 10 jobs that are created are indeed created with these skills that are needed, and those are things gained with a post-school qualification—university degrees and VET qualifications. It's critical that people acquire the skills that are in demand so they can have decent employment, decent career progression and the like.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I was at Box Hill TAFE I met with a student, Thomas, who had originally entered into a university course. Academically he was very capable, but he found it was not for him. Now he has enrolled into an electrotechnology course, and he's going to be one of those people that can participate in the transformation of the energy sector. He has chosen that path, and that is going to lead to a great career in the energy sector. It will be an area in massive demand, and it will mean a great job and a great career for him.
