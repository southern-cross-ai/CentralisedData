       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Disability Services and Inclusion (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023 (the consequential and transitional bill) makes consequential amendments and provides transitional arrangements to support the proposed Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is in line with this government's commitment to enable people with disability to participate fully in society and exercise full choice and control over their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides for the repeal of the Disability Services Act 1986 (the Disability Services Act) (in schedule 1) and facilitates the continued provision of disability supports and services funded under that act in accordance with the proposed new enabling legislation, the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will ensure the continuity of services and supports and prevent disruption of funding to disability providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 2 outlines the consequential amendments necessary to ensure the ongoing functioning of a range of current legislation as a result of the repeal of the Disability Services Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schedule 3 of the bill clarifies that the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023 will apply to any new funding arrangements and grants of financial assistance made from the day of commencement of that bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, to ensure consistency and continuity in the provision of disability supports and services, schedule 3 further clarifies that the repealed Disability Services Act will continue to apply to grants of financial assistance (including transitional grants) entered into under part
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        of that act prior to its repeal, for the duration of that agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It clarifies that the same is true of grants of financial assistance made under the repealed actâ€”they can continue to be administered under that act until the end of their agreement. This will also apply to any principles, objectives, guidelines and standards, accreditations, certificates of compliance and delegations that were made under the former act.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to ensure the continued safety of people with disability, their families and carers who access the supports and services authorised under the former act, the consequential and transitional bill specifies that any disability standards review panel for a state or territory established under the repealed act before the proposed bill commences will continue to exist for the term of its agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023, the consequential and transitional bill will deliver much needed support to Australia's disability services sector and contribute to creating a more inclusive society.
       </p>
       <p>
        It ensures a seamless transition in funding arrangements to existing Commonwealth-funded disability supports and services outside of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , demonstrating this government's commitment to the inclusion of all people with disability in Australian society and complementing existing legislation to fulfil our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
