       <p>
        I'm on my feet today to thank those emergency service workers—people who are working in hospitals and people who are out there working at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Hervey Bay
        </a>
        , Childers and Bundaberg—those frontline service providers, the volunteers, the charity groups, the concerned parents and grandparents for their courage to come to my office and speak in confidence about their support for the cashless welfare card in the electorate of Hinkler. They have absolutely come to us in numbers. In fact, the consultation conducted by my office alone indicated 74 per cent support. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        has conducted over 110 sets of consultations. That's not 110 individuals; that is 110 sets, groups. They are the business community, individuals, small groups, people in emergency services—the ones who are out there actually doing the work.
       </p>
       <p>
        We find ourselves in a difficult position, given the Labor Party's announcement in recent days that they will not be supporting the rollout of the card in the Hinkler electorate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        say to them that I'm not sure how much more consultation will be necessary. I am just not sure how much more is required. The committee, who put their report into the Senate last night, support the bill—one recommendation. They support the bill and it should be passed. So my message to those in the Senate, those on the crossbench, those individuals who will be considering this policy is: if necessary, come up and talk to these people, because we are here to talk about them. This is about the children of my electorate and the people who have challenges. This is a policy which has worked. You've supported it in other regions, and I'm asking you to consider it, because, quite simply, it is necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a very tough policy. I've acknowledged that many times. But the people who come into my office, who have been through the consultation process, have said to us over and over and over that they support it. In fact, there was a great surprise to me in one area: the number of children who are not being supported as they should be. We continue to hear stories about their money being lost on the pokies, on other forms of gambling, on alcohol and on drugs. Along with this, we get $1 million of additional assistance to ensure that we can address those challenges. These are challenging policies to implement. It will take time, but the Department of Social Services continues the rollout.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm saying to those in my electorate who support this policy that we have not given up. We will continue to do the work, because it is necessary. We even have the former federal Labor member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Courtice" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Courtice
        </a>
        , on the record saying that he supports this policy, because he knows what goes on. So I would say to all of those at the schools—the high school teachers, the principals—and to the concerned parents that I have spoken to and to those grandparents: we will continue to do the work to roll out the card, because it will work. I absolutely acknowledge again just how tough it is, but it is a reality of the situation we find ourselves in, and we must address it and address it now.
