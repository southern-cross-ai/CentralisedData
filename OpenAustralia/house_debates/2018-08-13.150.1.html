        Earlier this month, I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart_College" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart College
        </a>
        in Sorrento to present a number of students with certificates of commendation for their voluntary work in social justice. I joined Principal Peter Bothe, Social Justice Coordinator Rossana Hywood, members of staff, students and parents in the school auditorium to acknowledge them for their outstanding efforts in a range of community projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sacred Heart College has a distinguished record of providing a balanced, holistic education to students by encouraging academic learning and sporting achievement, as well as nurturing cultural, social and spiritual values. I was pleased to learn of the students' participation in the Young Vinnie's program and their many activities, including a visit to the Mercyville aged-care facility to spend time with the aged and serve morning tea. This year, the year 10 students took part in the Vinnie's winter sleepout. Ninety five students took part, raising $4,360. Students have also been involved in distributing handmade quilts to the needy. The Cancer Council biggest morning tea raised $716, and a further raffle by the staff raised $722. I learned of the year 11s' mission trip in which they raised funds and travelled to an orphanage in Vietnam, where they assisted with projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to acknowledge the individual efforts of two very outstanding students. Thirteen year-old Vincent Pettinicchio has been involved in preparing care packs for the homeless since the age of eight. As part of this year's project, 72 parents, 56 students and 10 staff members volunteered after school hours to pack more than 1,540 care packs.

        club of Hillarys also assisted with this project. Scott Guerini, aged 12, has been involved in raising money for Telethon through his walking. He walked 25 kilometres, at the age of four, to raise money for Telethon. He has continued to walk marathon-size distances to raise fund for the Telethon program, and had raised $100,000 by the age of 10. In 2016 Scott wrote an illustrated book of his journey entitled
        <i>
         Did You Know You Can Change The World
        </i>
        ? Since 2010 Scott has walked over 450 kilometres and raised $141,000 for Telethon. I commend the staff, students and parents of Sacred Heart College for their commitment to the social justice programs. Thank you.
