       <p>
        During the end of October last year I had the pleasure of meeting with two constituents, Rose and Dean Soraggi of Woodvale, who were at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        for the National Stroke Foundation Summit. Dean is a stroke survivor and both Dean and Rose told me how Dean's stroke has changed everything in their lives. Dean's first stroke occurred while he was in Exmouth in the north of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        on a fishing expedition, and it resulted in him being flown to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Gairdner_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital
        </a>
        in Perth by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        . He was later transferred to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Shenton Park
        </a>
        for his rehabilitation. Rose described her husband's stroke as a life-changing experience, and she told me that they still have to constantly ask and conduct their own research to get information for Dean's recovery to the level he is today. Along the way they have met with other stroke survivors and carers who share these concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had some experience with stroke in my family and believe that every effort should be made to help stroke survivors and their families get the information and support they need. Because stroke is Australia's second biggest cause of death and a leading cause of disability amongst adults, stroke should be a health research priority for Australia. I suspect that a lot of people do not comprehend just how serious the risk is. The National Stroke Foundation currently has a program called the Stroke Call to Action which is aimed at making stroke a health priority for everyone. I support this program as I realise that stroke, whether it is through killing or permanently disabling people, is a very serious issue.
