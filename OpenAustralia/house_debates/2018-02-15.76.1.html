        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the member for his question. I acknowledge his tireless efforts, work and his relentless advocacy for the communities in the electorate of Page. The families and businesses of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Rivers
         </a>
         are lucky to have such a hardworking local member delivering for them. The coalition government's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          North Coast
         </a>
         Regional Jobs and Investment Packages are a major shot in the arm for his local economy. The government will invest $25 million in 23 job-creating projects across the North Coast of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . All up, more than 500 new direct jobs will be generated through the construction phase. A further 500 ongoing jobs will be available to locals as a result of this coalition government investment. This includes $6.5 million for the Northern Rivers Rail Trail to boost new and revived tourism opportunities following the then state Labor government's decision to shut down the Casino-to-Murwillumbah rail service back in 2004 despite very widespread community opposition at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition's policies are delivering real results for regional Australia, as this investment exemplifies, with more than 100,000 jobs created in regional areas in the last year. This is part of 16 months of continuous jobs growth across Australia—the longest unbroken run since 1978—with 42,000 of those jobs created in regional New South Wales. That's the equivalent of the entire populations of Lismore, Grafton and Kyogle—all major centres in the Page electorate—getting a job in the last 12 months.

         The record of those opposite couldn't be more different. Labor is a party of job snobs. If you work in the mines or the energy-intensive manufacturing sector or in the livestock industries, you are looked down upon by the modern Labor Party. Your jobs mean nothing to them. Incredibly, the Labor spokesman for regional development, the member for Whitlam, celebrated Labor's overnight ban on live cattle exports back in 2011. He was popping the champagne cork, celebrating with inner-city activists while regional jobs and communities were destroyed. 'I welcome the decision by the minister to suspend live exports,' he said to the
         <i>
          Southern Highland News
         </i>
         in June 2011. The Labor Party has a complete disregard for the livestock industries, the coal industry and the thousands of jobs they create in my home state of Queensland. That's a lot of regional jobs that would be seriously at risk if Labor and the Greens were ever re-elected.
