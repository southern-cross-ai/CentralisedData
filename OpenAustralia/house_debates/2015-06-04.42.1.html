        Deputy Speaker:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ice is an insidious drug that paths its destruction through individual users, their families and our communities. Urgent but considered action is needed by all levels of government and our local community not only to halt the advance of this drug in regional areas but to eradicate it.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was the introduction to my submission to the federal government's ice task force. The north-west community, like so many other regional communities, is deeply concerned about the devastation that this drug can bring. That is why I have made combating ice a priority and will do everything I can, together with the government and this parliament, to support the community, law enforcement and front-line workers to rid our streets of this toxin. Since being elected, I have hosted a large community forum in Smithton, hosted a round table meeting with the federal Minister for Justice and have met with front-line workers, including health workers, rehabilitation specialists, law enforcement and current and former ice addicts.
       </p>
       <p>
        These meetings have helped me to understand the difficulty in eradicating this drug and to formulate my submission to the task force. I have asked all constituents to provide their feedback because so often we focus solely on what professionals have to say while neglecting the general public. I have included constituents' comments in my submission. While submissions to the task force have now closed, I will continue to work with everyone in the north-west community to put a stop to this drug that is wrecking lives, breaking the hearts of families and devastating our communities.
