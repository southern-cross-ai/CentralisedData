       <p>
        Australians need a social safety net that works for them, but, according to a group of residents in Vaucluse Gardens in Hobart, older Australians are increasingly being left behind by a safety net that is, quite frankly, not fit for purpose. Indeed, residents tell me how face-to-face services at Centrelink offices are diminishing, with the loss of a dedicated seniors counter forcing people to call or go online to access services. Moreover, Centrelink's phone systems are constantly overwhelmed by calls, with many reporting being stuck on hold for two, three or even four hours before being hung up on. Even if they get through, phone services often don't work well for older Australians, especially those with hearing loss. Add to this the fact that many senior struggle to access and use digital services and you can see why the drive away from face-to-face services is causing such anxiety.

        What's more, the increasing prevalence of scams has people wary of digital correspondence, and the aftermath of robodebt has people terrified of incurring debts. Putting the onus on vulnerable Australians to contact Centrelink in ways they aren't comfortable with is not only inconvenient; it's discriminatory. Constituents contact my office weekly to report difficulties with Centrelink. Yes, Services Australia staff do great work under difficult circumstances, but as a system it is, quite simply, not up to the job right now.
