        Can you smell that stench wafting over here from the Liberals? The Helloworld saga is putrid. But, sadly, it's nothing new when it comes to the coalition. In fact, the member for Fadden has a track record that would make

        blush. How could we forget the Rolex watch gift and being dumped from the ministry after it was revealed he had a financial interest in a company he spruiked while travelling on the taxpayer dime in China. He took his government phone on a trip to China where he met with communist officials, jeopardising our national security. He accepted donations from a developer, and then delivered in this chamber a speech written by a lobbyist for the same developer.

The member for Fadden is involved in a new business council based in a Sydney office that has no staff and is connected to his fundraising arm, the famous—or infamous—Fadden Forum. He headlined a fundraiser about the banking royal commission. And who could forget that he is one of the largest investors in a resources exploration company founded by a person once accused of embezzling

        There is a pattern to the behaviour on that side of the chamber. We've seen it with the member for Fadden—and we haven't heard the last of chumgate.
