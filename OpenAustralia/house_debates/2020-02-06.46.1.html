        I recently had the pleasure of visiting Youth Opportunities to meet with

        , Youth Opportunities was founded in 1997 by Peter Marshman AM with the aim of developing leadership skills in young people and breaking the cycle of long-term unemployment and disadvantage. The Youth Opportunities personal leadership program provides school students with a 60-hour wellbeing and life skills training program to increase self-confidence and motivation for school or study and to develop personal and career goals, followed by two years of ongoing mentoring. Each year, Youth Opportunities works with around 600 students across

        </a>
        , and over 10,000 have participated in the program to date.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a not-for-profit organisation, Youth Opportunities relies almost entirely on the generosity of donors and fundraising efforts to deliver their program, which is why I was pleased they successfully obtained a stronger communities grant of $5,000 to upgrade some office equipment. I, along with my office, attended their

        fundraising lunch, which was generously supported by Peter and Jenny Hurley at their Marion Hotel. If anyone is interested in supporting the very important work of this wonderful organisation, please donate online. Thank you to the board, CEO Erin Faehrmann, immediate past CEO and Glenelg footy club legend
