        My question is to the Minister for Defence: Will the minister please inform the House how the Morrison government's strong and certain record on defence and national security keeps Australia and Australians safe and secure, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question and also acknowledge the great work that he does with his defence community, not just through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Gallipoli Barracks
         </a>
         but for many of the not-for-profit organisations, the organisations that are helping veterans' groups. He goes above and beyond to help those groups, and we really should acknowledge that, Mr Speaker.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that we live in an incredibly uncertain time and that that uncertainty is only going to increase into the future. We're watching as circumstances unfold in the Ukraine at the moment, and in the Indo-Pacific we are very concerned about the build-up of nuclear weapons and the build-up of missiles, and we are worried about making sure that we can keep peace and security at the forefront in our own region.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why we have invested a record amount in relation to defence. It's why we've increased spending by over 60 per cent. It's why we've met and exceeded our commitment to raise defence spending above two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . We are investing more than $270 billion in defence capability. We're acquiring nuclear powered submarines, and we're undertaking the most significant renewal of the Navy since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         That contrasts to that which we inherited when we came into government. Defence was a messâ€”let's be very frank about it. The money that Labor had ripped out of defence meant that they had cancelled, cut or delayed over 160 projects. They hadn't ordered a submarine. They hadn't ordered a ship. They had not invested properly in our people. They took money out of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         , which meant that our effort to counter foreign interference and counter terrorism was put at risk. They took money out of the ACIC. They took money out of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         . They took money out the Australian Border Force. That's because they prioritised other issues above our national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         So if you're asking yourself, 'What would Labor look like if they won the next election when it comes to defence?' don't look at what they're saying now. Don't look at the rhetoric that's being pumped out by the backroom bullies of the Labor Party. Look at what they did when they were in government. That is your best guide to understanding what they would do if they were in government again. This Leader of the Opposition, as the Deputy Prime Minister, sat with Mr Rudd and with Ms Gillard and made the decision to cut spending to the bone when it came to defence. The men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         were those who suffered most, but ultimately Labor in charge of national security means that all Australians pay the price.
