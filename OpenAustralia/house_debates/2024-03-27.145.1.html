        to upgrade the airfield to support KC-30A aircraft to perform strategic airlift and air refuelling operations.

        . The proposed works were referred to the Public Works Committee on 28 November 2023. Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the works. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in mid-2024 and to be completed by the end of 2028. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee, ably chaired by the member for Moreton, for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
