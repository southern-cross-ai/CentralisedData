       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 14 December 2009, concerning a recently submitted petition on ongoing funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I regularly receive positive feedback from schools, parents and students about the value of the National School Chaplaincy Program (NSCP). I also understand that 98 per cent of school principals recently surveyed by the National School Chaplaincy Association about the effectiveness of chaplaincy in government schools, support having a school chaplain.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Given the success of the NSCP, an additional $42.8 million has recently been announced to extend the program for all participating schools until December 2011. The extension of the NSCP will ensure that those schools funded under the program will be able to continue to provide valuable support in the provision of student wellbeing services.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       In order to ensure the program is well targeted in future, a broad consultation process will be undertaken with stakeholders in 2010, These consultations will consider options for possible future pastoral care initiatives following the end of the program in December. 2011. The process will involve a range of stakeholders including state education departments, major service providers, representatives of independent and faith-based school systems, peak representative bodies for parent and community organisations, principals and other relevant interest groups.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government is determined to ensure schools are supported in providing for the wellbeing of their students and the NSCP has been effective in achieving this, This program demonstrates the Governmentâ€™s commitment to working with school communities, parents and other stakeholders to support wellbeing and positive development for all Australian school children.
      </p>

       I trust this information is of assistance.
