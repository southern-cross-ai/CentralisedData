        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What progress has the Albanese Labor government made on getting wages moving again, and what threats are there to this progress?

         I want to thank the member for Holt, someone who has dedicated her whole working life to getting wages moving for people in the retail industry. I'm pleased with the results that came out today in terms of more people in jobs. There are more than 820,000 new jobs under the Albanese Labor government, and the majority of them are full-time jobs. That's happening at the exact same time as people are earning more—and keeping more of what they earn—and as the gender pay gap is at a record low. Each of these hasn't happened by accident. It's happened because of government processes that were changed and laws that were changed. With every single one of them, the Leader of the Opposition has had the same response: to say no.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the Prime Minister argued that the lowest-paid workers shouldn't go backwards, the Leader of the Opposition said no. When we said we should turn up to the Fair Work Commission to give aged-care workers a pay rise, the Leader of the Opposition's position was 'no'. When we introduced the secure jobs, better pay bill, the Leader of the Opposition's position was to vote no. When we introduced the closing loopholes reforms, the Leader of the Opposition's position was to vote no. And when we said that every Australian taxpayer should get a tax cut, the Leader of the Opposition didn't just want to say no; he wanted to call an election over it to stop Australians from keeping more of what they earn, just as he'd tried to stop them from earning more. He opposed the secure jobs, better pay bill the moment he heard the title, and when arguing as to why he opposed it he said, 'It's going to result in higher wages.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, he's right. That's exactly why we did it. He's opposed to higher wages, and we have already heard from them that they've got a secret plan for a targeted package of repeals. Tonight is the chance to let people in on what they are. People have a right to know, if you're going after their wages, what your secret plan of repeals will be. We only know one of them so far. He's decided to go after the right to disconnect. The Leader of the Opposition's position is that you have to be available 24/7, even if you're not being paid.

          I hear the groans from those opposite. Don't forget, when the secure jobs, better pay bill was going through and it was likely that the Senate deliberations were going to continue, and I flagged with the parliament that we might have to return and work on the Saturday, they were outraged about having to defend their right to disconnect. But, on the concept that any low-paid worker should have to work whether they're being paid or not, that they should be constantly on call, their view is that that's up for grabs, no matter how passionate they are about their own right to disconnect. The Leader of the Opposition is determined to cut people's pay. He has opposed everything that has delivered pay rises, and it's time, tonight, that he let people know what the secret plans are.
