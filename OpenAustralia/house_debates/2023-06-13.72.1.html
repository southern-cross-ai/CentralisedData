        My question is to the Minister for

         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. In the gallery today are Glenden Watts and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Baldwin" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Baldwin
        </a>
        , and many other farmers from Mallee who will be impacted by the government's fast-tracking 28,000 kilometres of poles and wires across regional Australia. How many more farmers like Glenden and Bill will be impacted by Labor's arrogant policy to steamroll local communities in pushing forward 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines?

           The honourable member made a number of assertions in her question. It is appropriate to point out that those assertions are incorrect. In relation to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNI" rel="nofollow">
            VNI
           </a>
           West I'll say this: the number of farms affected will depend in no small part on the final routes selected.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEMO" rel="nofollow">
            AEMO
           </a>
           made an announcement two weeks ago that they had changed the proposed route based on community feedback. That is no bad thing. The new Option 5A pivots away from its original path, heading north-west instead of through Charlton and the broad irrigation district, to skirt around Kerang and hit the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
            Murray River
           </a>
           downstream of Barmah. This is the result of community consultation. Community consultation is something we take very seriously in the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, in the last sitting week, I met with the Murray River Group of Councils, who came to me to talk about the route. I accepted the meeting request, of course. They asked to speak to me about it. They said to me that they appreciated the consultation that AEMO and the federal government had engaged on. They appreciated the engagement with the government. They made that point to me. They requested a meeting and they got one.

               As I was saying, I met with those mayors in the impacted area. They made clear to me their support for the project. In fact, they announced in response to the government's announcement of Rewiring the Nation that, with local supply chain investment estimated to be in excess of $1 billion and with more than 3,000 jobs in the construction phase, this investment will deliver stimulus effects and long-term economic and social benefits.

That is what good representatives do—seek a meeting with the minister and talk the issues through. But we'll talk about the facts. The fact of the matter is that this

                 West link has been discussed for many years. We are getting on with the job. But we aren't, to be fair, the first government to focus on this issue. The previous government also focused on the issue. In fact, my predecessor, the then minister for energy, said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 We are investing in VNI West because it is expected to generate $1.9 billion in net market benefits …
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's what the member for Hume, my predecessor, said about this project. He was backing it in, saying how important it is. This is an important project that will be delivered properly by this government.
