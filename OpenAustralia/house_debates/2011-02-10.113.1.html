        I rise to take this opportunity to thank and praise the kindness and generosity of Northern Territorians, in particular those in my electorate of Solomon, for their efforts to rally behind the victims of the recent Queensland floods. The response my office has seen is overwhelming and highlights the extraordinary compassion and empathy that is typical Territorian. My mother, Sandra, and I personally delivered 120 kilograms of specially made care packages to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        . We toured the region with the federal member for Wright, Mr Scott Buchholz, and Senator Trood, where we were able to see firsthand the devastation in Gatton, Grantham and Murphy’s Creek. The locals were grateful for the items that we delivered.
       </p>

        I would also like to make special mention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Air_Express" rel="nofollow">

        , Northline, NQX Freight System Australia and Qantas, who collectively transported thousands of kilos of donated goods from the people of Solomon to Queensland, all free of charge. It is incredible that donations of clothing, footwear, books and toiletries are still being dropped off to my office. There is another shipping container almost full that will be heading to Queensland very soon. Further examples of amazing Territory generosity include one person who has donated 10 washing machines and 10 dryers, while another has donated a 2004 Commodore sedan, which he wants donated to a family who lost a car during the floods and who were not covered by their insurance. Another one is a local building company,

        eATE House, which has offered to supply five houses at cost.

        There were so many Territory community groups and local businesses who undertook fundraising activities to help raise funds for the flood victims. I was delighted to be involved with local radio station Mix 104.9’s fundraising activities, where we raised over $100,000. I was amazed at how small children were emptying out their wallets and giving their pocket money. It has given me, and it continues to give me, great pleasure and pride to see my electorate donating so generously to fellow Australians in a time of need.

        On a different matter, I am also pleased to announce that I have called this week for applications for my newly established mental health scholarship, which I first spoke about in my maiden speech. This endowment is to assist a student living in the electorate of Solomon who is studying towards a qualification in mental health. Mental health is a crucial issue in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and indeed Australia. I am committed to the improvement of mental health services in the electorate of Solomon. The scholarship will provide $3,000 to one student per year. I look forward to announcing the recipient of the scholarship later on this year.
