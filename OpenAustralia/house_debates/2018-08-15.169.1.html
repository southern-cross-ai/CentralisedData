        Ena Pearce was recently honoured by the Goonellabah Hornets Soccer Club for her passionate commitment to the club for the last 50 years. If ever there were a queen of soccer mums, it would have to be Ena. At 81 years of age, she is the most avid and unashamedly one-eyed supporter of Goonellabah Hornets, having done the soccer mum task for seven of her eight children from when her eldest child, Daryl, donned the club shirt in 1967. She ran the canteen for many years and would regularly have her car stacked to the brim with supplies required for sale. Once all her boys had outgrown the club, Ena's commitment to the Hornets did not stop. Her love affair has been for over 50 years, and, as she says, it will continue for as long as God gives her the strength to be there. Well done, Ena.

        Jeff Snow, an Alstonville firefighter captain, has called it a day. After serving the community for over 42 years as a firefighter, he will be missed by all. Jeff was one of the emergency services' first responder personnel, which is a vital and extremely important task for the safety of our region. The job can require you to be on call 24/7, which, when raising your family and running your own business, is a very testing time. He will continue to work as a mechanic in his own business. He was awarded both the

        and the Fire and Rescue Good Conduct Medal. I congratulate Jeff for all his involvement with the community and risking his life for others. Jeff, I wish you a happy and safe retirement from the service, and thank you for a job well done.

        . Craig Jenkins was recently recognised by Far North Coast Football. His dedication to the Rovers goes back three decades. When sons Tim and Michael started playing, he responded to the call for a coach and then in 1986 he began compiling club records for every competitive game played. Of course, Craig hasn't been there alone. His wife, Dianne, has always been by his side, supporting his passion and helping to create an extraordinary legacy for the Rovers. Congratulations to all the Rovers who achieved these milestones.
