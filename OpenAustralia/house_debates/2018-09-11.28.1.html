        Established in 2002, the national rural women's council seeks to ensure better social and economic outcomes for women in our rural townships and farms. The council works to support and grow vibrant rural, regional and remote communities. Each year the council holds a three-day residential leadership program here in Canberra known as the Canberra Muster. Each participant is required to complete an individual leadership project in her local community with a theme of strengthening community through women's leadership. The purpose of this project is to put the knowledge, skills and experiences gained at the muster to immediate and purposeful use in their community.

        . Roslyn wanted to empower women with a particular focus on increasing their ability to make ends meet, save, choose and use financial products, and seek information and advice. This week she's doing just that. I attended the launch of Financial Literacy for Women in Mount Gambier on Sunday. Workshops, which I have proudly supported via sponsorship, are running throughout this week with themes such as budgeting, insurance, superannuation and retirement. It's brilliant to see Roslyn embracing her leadership skills to help educate women in her local community to become more confident and more resilient financially.
