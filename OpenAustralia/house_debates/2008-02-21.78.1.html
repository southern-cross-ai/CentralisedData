       <p>
        As the clocks remind us, it is 4.30 pm on Thursday of a sitting week. At 4.30 pm the adjournment is called on for the purpose of the House being vacated, in past times, at 5 pm. That was to allow members to return to their homes. It has now occurred that we are discussing an adjournment when in fact the House will reconvene at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. As such, this House is wasting the time available to it this evening to carry on with government business. I note the Leader of the House was at pains to tell us today that they were the government that wanted to get on with government business, that they wanted to get their business up to the Senate with the greatest amount of speed and alacrity. Yet we are now sitting here getting ready to go home—but only to our motels, because we must return here tomorrow. That does not apply to everyone. As I entered the House this morning at eight o’clock, I noted a backbencher well known to me, with his suit pack in his hand, instructing a new member as to how you did not have to take your suit pack back up to your office to leave and do a scoot tonight; you just had to put it in those shelves on the side of the lobby as we enter, and of course that made your scooting a lot more convenient.
       </p>
       <p>
        I come from a family with a long work ethic. There might be some on the other side surprised to know that I was once a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        , until the high echelon found out, and they had a real worry about that. I have a real work ethic. I have no reason, having been given the night off last night, to go to my motel tonight or go out on the town. I want to work. Consequently, I seek leave to move a motion to suspend standing orders and sessional orders so as to permit the House to continue with its consideration of government business until 8.30 pm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        If leave is not granted, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent:

         <dt>
