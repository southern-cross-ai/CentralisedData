        Some MPs might be surprised to hear that many regional communities struggle with reliable supply of quality drinking water. Yes, in 2021 the colour of tap water in a number of the towns I serve is often brown and it's often smelly. The community of Yass is the latest to make some noise, but this is an issue for people in Cooma, Bombala, Tumbarumba, Bega and Tathra, and they can also relate to this issue. It's clear to everyone that water quality in Yass needs fixing. It's a situation that has gone on for too long and is causing increased anxiety and frustration in the community, not to mention that it is stripping away the opportunity that Yass offers new families and businesses.

        government for some time, and to its credit has presented a solution. There is at least progress on a short-term fix, but I think the community deserves better than that. A new water treatment plant is what council says the community needs long term.

        It's an insult that the Liberal-National government in New South Wales is spending 2021 crunching the numbers, asking themselves, 'Is Yass worth it?' My answer every time is yes. A brown, smelly shower would not be tolerated in the city, but, year after year, the residents of Yass have had to put up with just that. We really need to see some solid progress on this issue. Regional growth and the prosperity that flows from this needs confidence and a government that understands how country towns and economies work. I'll continue to support the community and council in achieving a solution, because I'm on the side of the Yass community.
