        This year's Bayside Australia Day awards have highlighted the incredible work of our local Goldstein community, which is doing an amazing job to build a stronger community as the foundation for our great nation. Congratulations to Deb Brook, who has been recognised as 2021's Citizen of the Year for leading our community's response to COVID, domestic violence and bushfires. As president of Bayside Community Emergency Relief group, she mobilised over 6,300 Bayside volunteers to donate items to fire ravaged communities and wildlife shelters during the

        has been awarded Senior Citizen of the Year for his environmental work as convener of the Friends of Bayside Roads program, which collects litter and rubbish. Bayside Community Emergency Relief was recognised with the Community Event of the Year award for its efforts in donating comfort packs to aged-care centres during COVID and to children displaced by family violence. John Eichler was given the environment award for his documentation of Bayside's flora and fauna. Congratulations as well to all those nominees who were recognised by having a chance at these awards, and congratulations to everybody who's doing great things for our community.
