        I rise to speak about the deeply concerning situation developing in Syria. The unilateral actions of the Erdogan regime in northern Syria are causing significant civilian suffering. Media reports indicate that at least 60 civilians have lost their lives and more than 150,000 people are displaced. The most affected are, of course, the Kurdish people. More than 30 million Kurds inhabit the mountainous regions straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . The Kurds represent many of the values that we have been fighting for in the Middle East. They are a multi-faith, pluralist, pro-Western people. While the majority are
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Muslims" rel="nofollow">
         Sunni Muslims
        </a>
        , there are

        , there are Shia Kurds, there are

        </a>
        and, indeed, there are Kurds of no faith.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kurdish military forces have been an important part of our offensive against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">
         ISIS
        </a>
        . Kurdish forces have held back, and regained territory from, ISIS in northern Syria since 2013, with the largest pocket of territory held by ISIS in Syria falling to the Syrian democratic forces in March of this year. While it was a great win for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        led coalition, ISIS sleeper cells remain a threat and we should never become complacent. ISIS is still a serious threat to regional peace and security despite their territorial defeat.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kurdish people who have fought for the same values as Australians now find themselves in Turkey's direct firing line in northern Syria. While I recognise that Turkey may well have legitimate domestic security concerns in the region, action of this nature will have grave consequences for regional security and undermine the gains made by the international coalition in its fight against ISIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports that ISIS supporters have recently escaped from a Syrian holding camp amid the conflict are of grave concern. I have deep concern for the region and for our Kurdish allies who find themselves in this terrible situation. I stand in solidarity with the Kurdish people and pray for an end to this current conflict. While the Australian government remains in close contact with our US, European,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Eastern
        </a>
        and other allies and security partners, some have already indicated imposing trade sanctions against Turkey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage the leaders of our government to continue to work with our coalition allies to pressure Turkey to withdraw forces from Syria and avoid escalation or opportunistic actions that cause further instability and, of course, deep humanitarian suffering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue of concern internationally is, of course, African swine fever. African swine fever is potentially the largest commercial animal disease event the world has ever seen. It's crippling pork industries internationally, as we've lost approximately a quarter of the world's pig population. While it has not entered Australia's shores, a lot of work is being done to tighten our borders to protect our pork producers and our global reputation as a supplier of clean, green food. The electorate of Barker represents the third-largest number of sow producers in this country by division. This is a real issue that I'm worried about. Our biosecurity efforts have been boosted and we have implemented changes to make sure that visitors bringing in undeclared, high-risk items are sent home and unable to return for three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        While African swine fever is not a threat to human public health or food safety, it's highly contagious for pigs and there is simply no cure. The disease entered eastern Europe in 2007. It is thought to have spread through food waste fed to pigs. It has killed over 30,000 animals within weeks. Our Australian domestic industries estimate 2.5 million pigs, across 2,700 producers, employing 36,000 people. Our government and industry are working together to mitigate the risks, but we all need to play our part.
       </p>
       <p>
        I implore everyone to do the right thing when travelling or shopping online internationally. Don't bring in products that are high risk, and ensure your friends and family do the same. This is a risk that is not worth taking and one that I ask you to consider carefully.
