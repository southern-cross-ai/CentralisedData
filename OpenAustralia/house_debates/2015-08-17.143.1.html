        I am pleased to inform the House that there are a number of industries in Tasmania showing promising growth and green shoots of economic recovery. The tourism industry in particular is kicking goals under Liberal governments in both Hobart and Canberra. Recent figures from Tourism Research Australia show that Tasmania recorded a 28 per cent increase in international visitors in the 12 months to March 2015, with 197,600 travellers arriving. This was the single greatest increase in international travellers by any state or territory in that period. The good news for tourism operators in Tasmania is that overseas visitors are staying longer and spending more in our beautiful island state. The largest growth sector was overseas holiday-makers, with 150,800 people taking a trip to Tasmania. This was a healthy increase of 33 per cent over the previous year. It is interesting to note that there was an increase of 48 per cent in the number of people from overseas travelling to Tasmania for education. The number of holiday nights spent in Tasmania by overseas visitors in the period increased by 50 per cent to 1.82 million, with the average length of stay increasing by 15 per cent to 12 nights. Overall visitor nights increased 37 per cent to 3.4 million, with the average length of stay increasing to 17 nights. The research also showed that international visitors spent a total of $304 million while in Tasmania, while the average spent per international visitor increased by 42 per cent. I also note that nearly half of the overseas visitors came from China. That highlights the exposure that Tasmania got as a result of President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Tasmania, our free trade agreement and recent trade missions to China by Tasmanian government and business leaders.

        Will Hodgman's government in Tasmania is supporting the Tasmanian tourism sector with an additional $12 million in tourism marketing and industry development. The Tasmanian government has set a target of 1.5 million visitors a year by 2020, which the tourism industry says it will create 8,000 new jobs. This target will no doubt be assisted with accolades like the recent

        World's Best Awards, where Tasmania was ranked the best island destination in Australia,

        region, and the fourth best island in the world. Tasmania also made it into Lonely Planet's world's best 10 island holiday destinations, being named second in the list of family-friendly destinations in Australia. Tasmania has unique visitor experiences to offer the world, experiences that make the most of our clean and green food and wine and rugged wilderness. For the Tasmanian tourism industry and the many other sectors in the state economy that benefit from it, there is much to be optimistic about.
