        Several residents in the suburb of Glenwood in my electorate have raised the issue of a lack of street posting boxes. The suburb of Glenwood has approximately 13,897 residents but there is but one street box for this entire suburb. As one constituent has noted to me in representations she made to the former minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Coonan" rel="nofollow">

        in 2007: ‘A postbox was removed at the corner of Sunnyholt Road and Sorrento Drive in Glenwood on the basis that this was for roadworks. However, it was never to be seen again.’ Glenwood is a very large suburb geographically. This one postbox is certainly not within walking distance of many residents. I have actually timed the drive from one end of Glenwood to the other. These are 50 kilometre an hour streets and it can take nearly 10 minutes driving to get to this postbox.

        I have made representations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        regarding this matter and I was advised by them that there are currently no plans to install a new street posting box. I find this response to be less than satisfactory and I have told them so. As a resident of this suburb, I am only aware of one street posting box being located in Glenwood. However, Australia Post told me that there are street posting ‘boxes’ located in Glenwood. I have confirmed there is only one box with the search facility on Australia Post’s own website. The response from Australia Post also notes that there are street posting boxes in

        and

        . These are nowhere near Glenwood. I continue to raise this issue for the benefit of residents and I look forward to their support.
