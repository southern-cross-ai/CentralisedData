        I rise today to speak about an appalling decision. I am absolutely appalled by the decision that paid parking will be introduced at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         West Lakes
        </a>
        shopping centre in my electorate. This is a real problem, especially for the elderly people and the socially isolated people who use the shopping centre. They use the shopping centre to use the chemist, doctors et cetera or just to cool off in the very hot summer months. A group, No Car Parking Fees for West Lakes, has been formed down there. This was formed last year when the plan was first spoken about. Over 1,150 signatures were collected on a petition from all the residents around West Lakes,

        , Semaphore Park and Tennyson who oppose paid parking at the shopping centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Socially it is going to impact on a lot of people, as I said, who use the centre for the whole day. It is very sad that it is going to also impact on the traders in the centre, because people do not like to pay for parking in suburban shopping centres. That is not to say that there are not any parks available. We regularly shop down there and there are plenty of parks that are always available. I am appalled by the decision of Westfield at West Lakes shopping centre, and I call on Westfield at West Lakes shopping centre not to introduce paid parking, for the sake of the many residents around there and the many elderly residents who use the centre not just for shopping but as a community hub.
