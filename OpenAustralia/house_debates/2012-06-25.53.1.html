       <p>
        I rise today to draw attention to National Pain Week, which will occur during the parliamentary winter break from 22 to 28 July, and National Carers Week, which occurred last week. These two important weeks are obviously connected, given that Australian carers often makes sacrifices to care and support those who are experiencing pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this month, I met with a resident from the electorate of Macquarie, Andrea Downing, who suffers from chronic pain on a daily basis. As a result of this chronic pain, Ms Downing faces daily challenges. Many like Ms Downing have reduced opportunities for work, having to opt for cheaper accommodation in locations such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        , where access to health services and suitable transport is limited.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following my meeting with Ms Downing I have reviewed what I consider to be startling statistics with regard to pain that will be broadly advertised during National Pain Week. One in five Australians suffer from chronic pain. Eighty per cent of those—that is, 16 per cent of the national population—do not have adequate access to treatment for their pain. Chronic pain is a very real and debilitating illness resulting in loss and a lot of misunderstanding. It is a real condition that can manifest itself under a variety of banners and requires thorough recognition as a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is absolutely critical that people with a disability and their families and carers are provided with the regular care, support and therapy equipment that they need. Effectively, this government will spend more each financial year on its interest repayments than it will spend in total over the next four years on the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. You can forgive Australian people such as Ms Downing for feeling short-changed because of the government's approach to chronic pain.
