        My question is to the Prime Minister. In May 2017 Labor called for a royal commission into the violence, abuse and neglect of Australians with a disability. For the last two years, and again a few hours ago in the Senate, the government has said no to this royal commission. Given ongoing and recent shocking reports about the mistreatment of Australians with a disability, will the Prime Minister finally join with Labor to support a royal commission which Australians with a disability and their loved ones have been calling for the last two years?

         My government takes abuse and neglect of people with disability very seriously, and we are engaging in substantial reform to improve the treatment of people with disability, many of whom will be eligible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As he would know, there have been multiple inquiries looking into issues of abuse and neglect of people with disability at both the federal and state levels. The National Disability Insurance Scheme, which I am very pleased to acknowledge was initiated by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and was supported by members of this side of the House, has been supported by us as we've been in government, as we have fully funded this initiative and we've been taking it through the implementation phase. This is the most significant social reform since Medicare and it will provide real choice and control for people with disability in the services they receive. As responsibility for special disability services shifts from the states and territories to a national system through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , the government has established new significant and comprehensive safeguards to prevent abuse and neglect of people with disability under the NDIS. The government has committed $209 million to establish the NDIS commission, which commenced operation on 1 July 2018 and continues to provide the National Disability Abuse and Neglect Hotline. These resources deliver the protection that people with disabilities deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
         The royal commission to investigate the quality of care and safety provided in residential and home based aged-care services includes how best to deliver aged-care services to people with disabilities residing in aged-care facilities, including younger people, and will complement the action the government is already taking to improve the treatment of people with disability, particularly young people living with a disability. The Leader of the Opposition may be aware of the initiatives we're putting in place to support investment in the development of accommodation for young people with a disability of the sort that, as the member for Brisbane will know, is championed by organisations like Youngcare. We're backing that in.

         The truth is the National Disability Insurance Scheme is in its early phases of implementation as these responsibilities are transferred. These need to be practised and put into place. We will always remain open to what more can be done to identify any egregious issues or any lack of care or support provided to people with disabilities in this country. Right now our focus is on implementing the National Disability Insurance Scheme, getting it right. It's a difficult job and it has not been a perfect implementation. It was never a perfect inauguration when it first came into being. But one thing is true: I believe it has always enjoyed bipartisan support in this chamber, and beyond the major parties to the other parties and Independents in this chamber. I would like for us to continue to operate in that vein.
