        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Project

        7000 Phase 2B—Maritime Patrol Aircraft Replacement Project.

        3C Orion aircraft with eight Boeing P8A Poseidon aircraft. As a result, Defence proposes to construct new, and refurbish existing, facilities to support operations, maintenance and training requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facilities will be at the main operating base, Royal Australian Air Force Base Edinburgh, and forward operating bases,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Bases Darwin, Pearce and Townsville. The project will also refurbish the existing torpedo maintenance facility and construct new explosive ordnance storage facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        Stirling. The proposed works will support Australia's advanced maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and response capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that that project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and it is expedient to carry out the proposed work. The committee also commended Defence for its community consultation—in particular, with traditional owners and Indigenous communities. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for one again undertaking a rigorous and timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin in late 2015 and to be completed on all sites by 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

The facility will provide the Australian Defence Force with the capability to integrate live flight training with virtual training devices, including flight simulators and computer based training platforms. The facility will better prepare the ADF aircrew for conversion to Defence's modern and more advanced operational helicopter types.

On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for again undertaking a rigorous and timely inquiry. I am pleased that the committee had the opportunity to visit HMAS Albatross in Nowra to see firsthand the need for these works. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in mid-2015 and to be completed on all sides by mid-2017. I commend the motion to the House.
