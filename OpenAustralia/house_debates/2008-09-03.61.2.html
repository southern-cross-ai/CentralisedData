        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, the Paralympics will take place in Beijing from 6 to 17 September. Prior to my departure to attend and represent the government at these games, I think it is significant that the House should send on our best wishes. Before a single event has even taken place at the games there is so much that we all have to be proud of within our Paralympic team. The courage, the determination and the discipline that is displayed by each and every one of these individuals should be celebrated, not just by those within the sporting community or the disability community but indeed by all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is sending our largest ever team this year, with 170 elite athletes, including 11 guide runners and pilots for the sight impaired. They will be supported by 121 officials, including the President of the

        </a>
        , Greg Hartung. Our government are proud and very strong supporters of this team. On Monday we saw the Prime Minister’s wife,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therese_Rein" rel="nofollow">

         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , farewell the team at Sydney airport. I am delighted that I, and later on our parliamentary secretary Bill Shorten, will be able to support our athletes in their endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course our support is also financial. The government are very proud sponsors. Earlier this year our government confirmed an extra $22.8 million over five years for the Australian Paralympic Committee to continue their success. Whilst the games are certainly not all about winning medals, the House may like to note that Australia is just 92 medals away from achieving a very impressive milestone of 1,000 Paralympic medals won in just 48 years of competition. This achievement is definitely within reach, with Australia winning 100 medals at the previous games in Athens. It is something that I am sure many Australians will be eagerly anticipating. I am sure that the House will join me in recognising this remarkable event and sending on the best wishes of all of us to the Australian Paralympic team.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to echo the comments of the Minister for Sport in relation to the Paralympians and wish them the very best in their journey and their endeavours overseas. They are true representatives of the Australian spirit. Every single day of their lives is a gold-medal performance as far as we are concerned. I think it is important to note that never before were the Paralympians highlighted as well for their efforts and for their continued support of the Australian flag and all that it stands for in this country than in the 2000 Olympics, the Sydney 2000 Games. They showed their tenacity, their strength of spirit, their ability to get on with the job and all that the Olympic theme stands for during those games. I saw on many occasions Paralympians from Australia hugging and supporting athletes from overseas, clapping and cheering them on. I think it is a kindly reminder to all of us, especially those here in this House, of how when we unite towards a common goal of humanity we can achieve great things.
