         National Capital Authority
        </a>
        has received an application for proposed improvements to the existing Lobby Cafe. These works are to be located on sections 2 and 34, Parkes. The works have been designed so that they can be easily removed in the future and will provide an enclosed all-weather seating area for the existing cafe. The proposed improvements will have an outlook over the National Rose Gardens, which will enhance the visitors’ appreciation of the heritage listed gardens. The finishes include natural wood finishes, clear glass windows and neutral fabric colours. The use of the existing concrete footpaths and the addition of a small new area of concrete paving will ensure that there is little or no disturbance to the drip lines and the roots of the rose garden beds and existing nearby trees. The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal pursuant to section 12(1)(b) of the

          Local Government

Our national capital committee has not had an opportunity to look at them in detail, but that is not a concern. I am of the view that these works will be welcomed and I thank the minister for the encouragement in relation to the moving of the motion. I look forward to seeing the works completed.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
           National Capital Authority
          </a>
          has received a works approval application from Questacon to install two sculptures along Parkes Place. These sculptures are the Einstein and rock music sculptures respectively. The Einstein and rock music sculptures are proposed to be located along the eastern boundary of section 57, Parkes, outside the Questacon building, facing the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           High Court of Australia
          </a>
          . The sculptures are intended to be in place for a period of five years.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Einstein sculpture has been designed to create different images depending on the viewing position. The sculpture will consist of a metal base with the formula E=mc
          <sup>
           2
          </sup>
          in relief style on the base front. The upper element of the sculpture will be cut out of metal plate and will have a dipped, galvanised finish. The sculpture is to be set on a newly paved area and is to be 3.3 metres in height and 1.8 metres in width.
         </p>
         <p>
          The rock music sculpture comprises two large metal structures that have a musical bed of nails trapped between them. Visitors to the sculpture will be able to pour small stones into the bed of nails and these stones will strike the nails and a musical sound will be created. The sculpture is to be set on stones and gravel. The sculpture is to be 1.9 metres in height and have a maximum width of one metre at the base stand and 0.9 of a metre at the sculpture itself.

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
                Local Government
               </a>
               , Territories and Roads. I am sure that he will agree with me that Questacon is one of those remarkable institutions not just in Canberra but in this country. The way it works is very highly regarded, particularly with our younger population but with the population in general. The hands-on experience of science within Questacon is just so fantastic. It sounds like we now have coming on stream an external-to-the-building experience of similar magnitude. I am sure the minister and many others in the House, like me, are looking forward to what sounds like a musical experience with a scientific base. Questacon is to be congratulated on the work it does. I look forward to seeing its completion and hearing about the experiences people are going to enjoy as a result of this initiative.
