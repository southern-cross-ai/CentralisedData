         Liverpool Hospital
        </a>
        in south-west Sydney. The institute was established to undertake medical research that specifically addresses and can be applied to the needs of the local population and wider Australia. As a charitable organisation, the Ingham Institute relies on donations and sponsorship to continue its important life-saving work. It has been fortunate enough to receive the long-running support of some great Australians, including founding benefactor Bob Ingham AO, a visionary man and major supporter, and major supporter Lady Fairfax

        , with its research team exploring new medical approaches to a range of critical diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, infectious and inflammatory diseases, community and population health, childhood health, injury and rehabilitation, and mental health. The Ingham Institute is now home to more than 35 research groups and more than 200 of Australia's leading researchers and senior clinicians who are at the forefront of some of the most advanced medical breakthroughs and clinical outcomes relating to key disease areas affecting Australians.

        Officially opened in October 2012, the Ingham Institute's research precinct in Sydney's south-west comprises a state-of-the-art research building and the Ingham Institute Clinical Skills and Simulation Centre, which is a high-tech training centre run by the University of New South Wales providing hands-on training to clinicians, nurses, allied health professionals and students. Another component of the precinct is the institute's research bunker, containing the

        linear accelerator, a highly advanced cancer therapy technology that will improve radiotherapy treatment for Australia's cancer patients. The MRI linear accelerator is one of only three in the world, and an Australian first. The new technology will be installed and operational by the end of this year, and is set to improve the precision and accuracy of radiotherapy in this country.

        The Ingham Institute is also home to

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTC" rel="nofollow">

        measures single cancer cells so that researchers can isolate and study their genetic make-up. These findings then provide clues to various questions researchers have including why some cancers spread and others do not.

        This Friday, I will be attending the Ingham Institute's luncheon celebrating International Women's Day, along with leading researchers and special guests at the Camden lakeside golf and country club, in my electorate of Macarthur. The Ingham Institute's inaugural International Women's Day luncheon was held last year at Harrington Grove Country Club, that is also located in Macarthur, and centred on women's cancer research programs whilst honouring top female research scientists. The luncheon was attended by more than 200 community supporters and was headlined by Channel 9's

        This year's Ingham International Women's Day luncheon will once again be supporting an important cause: women in science. International Women's Day is a global day, celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of women. It is also a day to reflect on how far women have come in their struggle for equality, peace and development, and to celebrate the courage and determination of women who have changed history.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the Ingham Institute for their signification contribution to the International Women's Day cause. I would also like to congratulate committee members Adriana Care, Sophia Cooley, Natalie Herd, Lyn Ingham, Lisa Luff, Emma Macfarlane, Tracey Roberts, Leanne McNamara and Irene Vitocco, for organising yet another wonderful event this year, and celebrating International Women's Day 2015. I look forward to joining the Macarthur community in supporting this cause.
