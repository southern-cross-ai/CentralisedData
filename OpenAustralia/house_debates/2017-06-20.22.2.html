        Today I rise to speak on a sad situation, and that is the passing of a stalwart in the

        n Greek community, Mr Elias Mavrogiorgis. Mr Elias Mavrogiorgis was born on 5 January 1947 on the beautiful island of Ikaria in the Aegean Sea, and he passed away peacefully on 15 June 2017.

        community of Adelaide has lost a great man. Elias migrated to Australia in 1956 and, from the beginning, immersed himself in all things in the community, including the pan-Ikarian association of Australia and the significant work that he did in the Greek Workers Educational Association of

        , known as 'Platon', and there he assisted many migrant Greek workers. He was passionate about supporting newly arrived Greek migrants. Elias worked for over 30 years at Rubber Mills'—as it was known then—Bridgestone site at Edwardstown. It was there that he assisted a number of newly arrived migrants with their very first job.

        The same enthusiasm was carried through to his various and numerous volunteer roles within the

        My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Jenny, and his children, Maria, Georgina and Vasili and their families. Our community is better and stronger thanks to Elias's work, his efforts and his contributions.
