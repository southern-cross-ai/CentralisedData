        I rise to table a petition from concerned residents in Macarthur. This petition of 1,657 signatures draws to the attention of the House and the Minister for

        the need for a Medicare centre in Narellan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Macarthur's population is expected to double in the next two decades and more than 200,000 people are expected to move into the new estates and suburbs surrounding Narellanâ€”areas such as

        and Harrington Grove. It is imperative that as the population grows we provide new and existing residents with the necessary infrastructure and services to support this growth. The people in my electorate are calling on better access to a close-by Medicare service, and they should not be ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the call for a Medicare centre in Narellan, in addition to the existing services in Camden and Campbelltown. In this part of my electorate there is little or no public transport and the population is ageing. Many elderly or disabled residents must rely on family members to take time off work to drive them to Medicare centres out of town. I believe that every Australian should be able to access the government services they need, especially when it comes to their health and wellbeing.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        is an excellent service, but we need better accessibility to these services in the Macarthur region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents in my electorate who are elderly, living with a disability or suffering ill health have asked for help, and they should not be ignored. I call on the government to consider opening a Medicare centre in Narellan so that the most vulnerable residents in my electorate can access the services they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table this petition of 1,657 signatures because I believe a Medicare centre in Narellan would be a great outcome for the people of Macarthur. I table this petition and bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health and Ageing.

        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of concerned Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House the need for a Medicare Centre in Narellan. Macarthur's population is expected to double in the next two decades and more than 200,000 people are expected to move into the new estates in the suburbs surrounding Narellan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to support this petition which would allow for a Medicare Centre to be located within the Narellan business district in addition to the existing services in Camden and Campbelltown.
