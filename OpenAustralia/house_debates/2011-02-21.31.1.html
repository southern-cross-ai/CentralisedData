       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post —petition request for a street posting box in Pakenham
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 25 May 2010 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee’s consideration regarding a request for a street posting box at the corner of Irving Road and Ahern Road, Pakenham. I apologise for the delay in replying.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation, including all operation matters. As far as practicable it is requested to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has noted that its policy concerning the provision of street posting boxes takes into account the general increased mobility of the population, constant demographic changes, shifts in posting habits and Australia Post’s Community Service Obligation commitment to offer reasonable postal network access to its customers.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The policy provides that in capital city metropolitan areas and provincial cities, a street posting box facility will be provided at or near all postal outlets. In addition, street posting boxes will be provided so that residents have access to a lodgement point within two kilometres. In providing posting facilities, Australia Post gives preference to sites where adequate postings can be anticipated.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that a detailed examination of the suggested area in Pakenham shows that there are currently three posting boxes nearby:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Corner of Princes Highway and Deveney Street, Pakenham (approximately 650 m);
       </li>
       <li>
        Pakenham Post Office at Main Street and John Street (approximately 1.6 km); and
       </li>
       <li>
        Corner Leigh Drive and Army Road, Pakenham (approximately 1.9 km).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="italic">
       I am informed that, based on the existing level of demand in the area, Australia Post considers that the reasonable posting needs of the local community are being met by the current spread of posting facilities and that the provision of an additional posting box cannot be justified at this time.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
