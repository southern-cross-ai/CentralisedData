        <i>
         Hobart
        </i>
        , is due for delivery in 2016. The air warfare destroyer ship sustainment facilities project will provide permanent maintenance, systems support and infrastructure at Garden Island and training facilities at Randwick Barracks and HMAS

        in Sydney New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Garden Island in Sydney will be operational base for the new air warfare destroyers, and the project proposes to co-locate and share certain facilities with the new landing helicopter dockships that will also operate from Sydney. At Garden Island there will be berthing infrastructure upgrades to the walls and a new shared three-storey office building to accommodate personnel involved in maintaining and keeping the ships operational. At Randwick Barracks there will be new air warfare destroyer training centres for crews which also co-locate and share certain facilities with the landing helicopter dock training centre. At HMAS
        <i>
         Watson
        </i>
        there will be a new air warfare destroyer command team trainer to practise and hone the ship's command teams in the profession of maritime warfare.

        The estimated cost of the proposal is $109.9 million plus

        and includes all delivery costs from management and design fees, construction costs, information communication technology, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and allowance for escalation. Capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Sydney region and local industry with significant opportunities for subcontractors in the construction industry over the next three years. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works should proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence later this year and be completed by late 2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        The Australian Broadcasting Commission, the ABC, currently operates three sites in Melbourne: one at Southbank and two at Elsternwick. In 1999, the ABC purchased the site immediately adjacent to its existing

         Southbank Centre
        </a>
        with the long-term objective of consolidating all its Melbourne based staff and operations, with the exception of television outside broadcast operations, on one site at Southbank. The proposed Melbourne Accommodation Project will achieve this objective together with a range of other ABC strategic, functional and financial objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an era of converging media, the proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP" rel="nofollow">
         MAP
        </a>
        will build an efficient and flexible working environment for ABC staff that reflects and supports the ABC charter. The proposal also aligns with a range of government policy objectives in the areas of the transition to digital television and digital radio services in metropolitan areas, environmental sustainability and the delivery of high quality and diverse broadcasting services including international television. The project involves construction of purpose built accommodation on the site immediately adjacent to the current Southbank broadcast site in Sturt street, Southbank. The consolidated facility will house all ABC radio, television and online production in Melbourne as well as broadcast and support facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $176.4 million, including project management, design, construction, building fit-out and the

Existing leases on all properties are due to expire between 2015 and 2018 with no opportunities for lease extensions. The new facilities are required to satisfy contemporary quarantine standards and meet all future demands, particularly in the area of high-risk species. A single consolidated facility has been determined to be the best option to respond to this need. The proposed post-entry quarantine facility project will be delivered by the

        , which owns the project site and facility. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will operate and manage the proposed entry quarantine facility. The estimated cost of the proposal is $293.1 million plus GST and includes all of the costs associated therewith. The land for the project was purchased in Mickleham, Victoria, at a cost of $35 million in June 2012, utilising funds provided for this purpose in the 2011-2012 budget. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these projects and works proceed. Subject to the parliamentary approval, the construction will commence in late 2013 and will be completed by late 2018.
