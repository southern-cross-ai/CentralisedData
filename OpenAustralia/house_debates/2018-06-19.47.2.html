        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, a whistleblower tells me that from 1 July Centrelink will stop backdating payments to the intention-to-claim date. This is unacceptable, because people needing Centrelink can initially be in crisis and unable to lodge the paperwork immediately—for example, women fleeing domestic violence—and, when they do, the process can be convoluted, with delays commonplace. This change would also appear to be illegal, because section 13 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        (Administration) Act 1999 clearly intends that a person is taken to have made a claim when they first contact Centrelink. Prime Minister, will you stop this unfair, unlawful and sneaky attack on the most vulnerable members of our community?

            The government is committed to ensuring more Australians find jobs, maximising their ability to support themselves and their families. However, for those who are unable to find work, we have a strong social welfare safety net, and the only reason we can continue to guarantee that into the future is because we've got a strong economy. The honourable member from Tasmania understands well how much stronger the Tasmanian economy has become because of the great Liberal leadership of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hodgman" rel="nofollow">
             Will Hodgman

            , supported by our coalition government in Canberra.
           </p>
           <p>
            The honourable member described this change as unlawful and sneaky. The honourable member would recall that it was a policy change that was part of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_Reform" rel="nofollow">
             Welfare Reform
            </a>
            ) Bill, which was debated and passed by the parliament in March this year. The honourable member didn't speak in the debate, but he did vote against it. The change was made in schedule 11 of the bill, so it is both lawful and very transparent.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The rationale for the amendments—
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm quoting from the
            <i>
             Bills Digest
            </i>
            , which is available to everybody—
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            is that the deeming provisions were introduced at a time when claim forms were mailed to claimants, completed and then returned to Centrelink by mail. With the progressive rollout of online claiming, these provisions are no longer necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why, in the debate the honourable member voted in and presumably paid attention to, the change was made.
