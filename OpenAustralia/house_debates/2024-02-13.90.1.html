        I understand there are going to be other speakers, so, in terms of the times that I offer as to how late this will go tomorrow night, some of that depends on how long we spend debating the procedure. I'll try to be brief, but I'll leave it to others to make their own call. The intention here is that, because there have been such strong views around the parliament on the government's tax plan, we want everyone who is on the list to be able to speak and we don't want people to have their speaking time cut short. As you'd be aware, last week we did one late night. We did a late night last night. Tonight we'd similarly go till 10 o'clock. Tomorrow night, on the current length of the speaking list, we'd go through till 8.30 pm, but there would be capacity for it to go later either if people add to the speaking list or if the House is disrupted in other ways. Then we would deal with consideration in detail on the Thursday morning. We'd start on Thursday morning with a division if required, although I don't see any indication that there's going to be a division on the bill—although possibly there might be one on the second reading amendment or something like that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The argument will be made, I'm sure—by a different person, but I suspect it's a similar script—that somehow this involves a gag and guillotine of debate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        can explain: for the Morrison government tax cuts the second reading debate ended up being closed with the motion that the question be put after one hour and 45 minutes of debate. Already we have had 10 hours, with 47 speakers after introduction. I expect there'll be another five or six hours of debate today, another four hours tomorrow morning and then however late it goes tomorrow to make sure every member gets to speak. That's somewhat different to one hour and 45 minutes, and whoever is about to stand up and say that this is an outrageous motion will I suspect be one of the people who voted in favour of the question being put after one hour and 45 minutes. I know I shouldn't pre-empt. Maybe I'll get a declaration of admiration! Let's just see how we go.
       </p>
       <p>
        The consideration in detail on the tax cuts for the Morrison government went for an hour and a half. But don't think that was an hour and a half of debate: 28 minutes of that time was taken up with divisions, shutting people down and preventing people from speaking. Based on the speaking list that's currently in front of us, in terms of comparison with previous tax bills, debate time should go for 12 times longer than what happened with the Morrison government, and in terms of consideration in detail, more than double the time of the Morrison government's tax legislation without people spending half an hour in divisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's what this resolution would do. I'll commend it to the House. It means everyone gets to speak. It's a significant difference to previous terms as to how we've debated tax legislation. And we will now cue to either logic or outrage—I'll leave it to you.

         We weren't going to say anything. We were just going to let this go through, and we're still going to do that. But, given that the minister was there trying to apologise for the fact that he's gagging and trying to use other examples, I thought, 'Well, I'd better get up and just have a little bit of fun.' With all that effort he went to, to make out that he wasn't gagging when that's what he's done, it probably needed to be pointed out. We're not going to oppose this. But given that the minister spent so long trying to apologise, in a fairly funny way, for what he was doing and wouldn't just face up and just say, 'Well, this is what we're doing,' I just thought I'd get up and make the point that sometimes it's better to just be straight, Minister!
