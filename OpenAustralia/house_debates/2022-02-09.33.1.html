       <p>
        I am delighted to announce in this, the Australian parliament, that the inaugural Women's Shed Week will be held this year between 6 and 12 March. Most Australians would be very familiar with the Men's Shed movement, with thousands of sheds dotted across the Australian landscape. But I suspect fewer would be familiar with the Women's Shed movement, with now over 20 sheds across the country. I can assure you they are every bit as impactful in their local communities as are the Men's Sheds. Indeed, the day will come when their number will swell to not just meet but indeed beat the number of Men's Sheds. So mark your diaries: 6 to 12 March is the inaugural Women's Shed Week. It's beautifully timed, by the way, because it will coincide with

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to pay special tribute today to the Coolum Women's Shed not only for the extraordinary work that they do on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , connecting women and making sure they have opportunities to socialise and get together; they too have played a lead role in ensuring that the inaugural Women's Shed Week takes place. Well done.
