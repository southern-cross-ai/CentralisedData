        I am very proud to represent a wonderful and diverse electorate—as most of us do in this place—and that is the electorate of Hindmarsh which stretches from Adelaide's beachside suburbs to the inner-city western suburbs. It is filled with fantastic community groups, businesses, organisations and a whole bunch of groups that create vibrancy and a real sense of community. I am pleased to be talking today about three such organisations in my electorate that will receive a much needed boost to make their work more effective and the people they serve to feel safer. The three groups are the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_Amateur_Football_League" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         West Adelaide
        </a>
        Football Club—one of the greatest football clubs in the world and the club that I have supported my entire life, and will do until the day I die—and the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Safer Communities Fund is designed to help local governments, schools, and community organisations such as the ones I just named, address security concerns in and around their facilities. The South Australian Amateur Football League will receive $15,000 to install security sensor lighting. The South Australian Amateur Football League, now referred to as the Channel 9 Adelaide Football League, was formed on 8 March 1911 and its first match was played on 6 May that year. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , John Kernahan, and the public relations person, Dee Shephard, who do a great deal of work in the community.

        During the election campaign, together with the Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , we pledged that if we were elected, we would invest $6.6 million to upgrade and modernise the league's facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebarton_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Thebarton Oval
        </a>
        , also known as Audi Arena. Thebarton Oval has been a key part of sporting and community events in the western suburbs for many years. An estimated 11,000 South Australian Amateur Football League players, representing 77 clubs around the Adelaide metro area, are involved in the league and use these facilities. They include 500 female participants and players, as well as players from Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        backgrounds. In addition, more than 90 not-for-profit organisations currently use Thebarton Oval's facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        My election commitment was intended to boost the stadium's capacity to cater for sporting events and community events. The upgrades would have included a fourth change room facility, a new hospitality area and a new function room. In addition, the upgrades to the facilities would help make the South Australian Amateur Football League more self-sufficient.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adelaide_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        earlier. They will also receive a grant of $15,000 from the Safer Communities Fund to upgrade lighting and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        facilities. I must admit that I did serve on their board for the last three years. While I was on their board we won a premiership—I do not put that down to me—but this year, unfortunately, we have won the wooden spoon. I am hoping for better things next year for the West Adelaide Football Club and certainly a much better year than we have had this year.

        They are an important sporting club in the western suburbs. They are a great community club. They have served the western suburbs for many years. Their headquarters are located on Milner Road, Richmond. As I said earlier, West Adelaide has a long and proud history. It was established in 1892 with the wonderful red and black colours. Many people will see me wearing their guernsey when I go for a walk in the mornings. Five years later it joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANFL" rel="nofollow">
         SANFL
        </a>
        . It has become a very successful football club not only in the sporting arena but also in the social space. I commend the club's strong commitment to giving back to the community. It has a range of youth engagement programs and many other activities where the community fits into the football club—sporting events and a whole range of things. It will have upgraded lighting and CCTV to help the club achieve its objectives.
       </p>

        Finally, Holdfast Bay, which is a council in my electorate that covers the beautiful suburbs of Glenelg,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Somerton Park
        </a>
        and Brighton, will receive $60,000 to implement a crime prevention project at Partridge House. Partridge House is one of the oldest buildings in Glenelg. It is a beautiful old turn-of-the-century building. The historic building is set amongst stunning gardens and grounds. It will receive this grant to implement a prevention through environmental design program around Partridge House.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPTED" rel="nofollow">

        is a set of guidelines that can be implemented to enhance the urban environment through designs that reduce opportunities for crime.
