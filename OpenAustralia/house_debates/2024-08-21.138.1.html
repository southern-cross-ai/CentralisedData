         The Hunter
        </a>
        has produced a stack of professional and elite athletes, and I want to make sure that we support the next crop of our local sporting talent so that our next generation of superstars comes from the Hunter too. Unfortunately, talent and determination alone are not always enough to reach the top. Participating in high-level sport comes at a cost, and it's mostly parents who put their hands in their pockets to get their children to competitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Local Sporting Champions program provides financial assistance to young people to compete, coach or umpire in their chosen sport. I know firsthand how expensive your chosen sports can be, especially when you're competing on the state, national or international stage. These small grants make a lot of difference to the athletes and their parents. I want to congratulate our recent local sporting champions.

        Congratulations to all of these local sporting champions. Sport has always been a massive part of the Hunter, and its amazing to see so many young people from our area still competing at a high level.
