        On Saturday night, I had the great pleasure of attending the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxby_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Roxby Downs
        </a>
        carols night. There were probably 250 or 300 people on the town oval. Well done to Theresa Bunyon, Ben Vandeleur and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Stewart" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Stewart
        </a>
        , for putting all of that together. There were some terrific performances from a young lady called Codey Napper, who did wonderful versions of 'Have yourself a merry little Christmas', and '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas" rel="nofollow">
         White Christmas
        </a>
        '. The kids from St Barb's school were there, and they had a guest appearance from the member for Grey, Rohan Ramsey, I must confess. Thanks to Theresa Bunyon for the loan of her guitar—mine was malfunctioning somewhat—and apologies to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kelly" rel="nofollow">

        because it was the first time that I played 'How to make gravy' in public. It was not a bad job but certainly not up to Mr Kelly's standard yet. I will keep working at it.

        It was a wonderful event because families were all together. Roxby Downs is one of the highest income communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . It is also one of the youngest and one of the ones with the most families. It's a really good place to bring up kids. The community pulls together on these occasions and really makes it happen. It was one of those wonderful Christmas feelings, being out on the oval with the people of Roxby Downs on Saturday night. We got great weather—and that doesn't always happen. We had a wonderful night together. I thank them for the opportunity to be with them.
