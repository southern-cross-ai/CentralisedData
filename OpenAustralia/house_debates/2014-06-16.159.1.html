        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the fantastic work that a number of youth groups are doing in my electorate of

        . I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the incoming president, Helana Tulloch, and her executive, which consists of the vice-president, Khalid Almaktoum, the treasurer, Stephen Coffey, the secretary, Emily Sharp, the functions director, Georgina Kreutzer, the professional development director,

        , the international services director, Scott Browning, the public relations officer, Elizabeth Brosnan, and, of course, the wonderful past president, Tenille King. This is a fantastic organisation in my electorate and I commend it on its work.

        Honourable members in this place are well aware of the considerable work that is done in our respective local communities by Rotary clubs. Rotary is a fantastic organisation, as is its youth wing, Rotaract. The Rotaract Club of Burleigh Heads was formed to encourage 18- to 30-year-olds to take part in activities that help build our community and fundraise for worthy causes. It is all about changing lives and making our community an even better place. During its first 16 months the club has gone from strength to strength and I am so proud that we have such a dedicated team of young people who are volunteering their time to help others.
       </p>

        I am very often inspired by the young people in my electorate, and I was pleased to recognise some fantastic young recipients of the McPherson Young Community Achiever Awards in April this year. Early next month I look forward to hosting a special Y20 youth forum at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_University" rel="nofollow">
         Bond University
        </a>
        in my electorate with one of our country's delegates to Y20, Jonathan Pavetto. Jonathan will seek the views of southern

        youth on a range of economic issues ahead of his participation in the Y20 Summit in Sydney in July, which, of course, feeds into the G20 Summit that will take place in Brisbane in November. I am looking forward to the youth forum as a chance to give some of the amazing local young people in my electorate the chance to have their say. It is great to be able to encourage and support our youth as they participate in debate, contribute to society and experience the great personal satisfaction that comes from being involved and active in the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to encourage and commend the work of the Rogue &amp; Rouge Foundation, which is a charitable organisation that helps to address mental health challenges within our community as well as diminish the stigma placed upon these conditions.

        &amp; Rouge Foundation, in collaboration with the Smith Family and Bond University, are engaging teachers, principals and parents in discussing the future of our young people. They are hosting an event, 'Empowering the next generation', on 25 June at Bond University. I encourage everyone to attend. I congratulate Nicole Gibson, the founder of Rogue &amp; Rouge, and her team and wish them all the very best.
