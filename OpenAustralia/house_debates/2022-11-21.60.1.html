        CHESTERS () (): Last Friday I had the privilege of co-chairing, with Senator Linda White, a local government aged-care roundtable for Victorian local government councils. In Victoria, local government are the dominant provider of community in-home care supportâ€”support for our older Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victorian councils are best practice. They have strong governance, good leadership, good wages and low turnover of staff and demonstrate the very best of what the royal commission is asking us to look at. This government has returned to the recommendations that the royal commission made, particularly in relation to in-home aged care. This government has committed to return to the recommendation that the area be reviewed, extending the current funding arrangements for local governments for at least 12 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        These people are respected. During the time of the pandemic, these in-home aged-care workers were the friendly face that older residents came to rely upon. Still today, in many cases, they might be the only person one of our older Australians in our communities speak to each day. They service the more complex clients. They service the people who live further out of town, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their postcode, is able to receive support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the councils for their honesty and their commitment to work with us on finding a better solution for in-home aged care.
