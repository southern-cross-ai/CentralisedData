        There is a celebration this weekend in the electorate of Page. It is the centenary of the St Joseph's Primary School at Woodburn, celebrating, obviously, 100 years of wonderful education in that community. It draws families from Woodburn,

        , Broadwater and surrounding rural areas like

        , who—as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would know—pioneered schools in times of great hardship and poverty. The first quite humble building is now a wonderful school. The principal, Janette Wilkins, and the parish priest, Fr Richard Foley, are very actively involved in running this very successful school community.

        On Saturday night there is going to be a formal dinner at the Woodburn Evans Head

        , and on Sunday everyone is invited to attend mass at 9 am and the official centenary celebrations at 11 am, which I am very much looking forward to. To all the current staff and students and, indeed, to all past staff and students: I look forward to catching up with many of you at the mass and the official ceremony on Sunday.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay my respects to the Sisters of St Joseph. They are a group of nuns who taught me as well. They have left their mark in the community of Woodburn, as they have in many communities across our country.
