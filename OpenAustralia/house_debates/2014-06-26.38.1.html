        Mr Gore on his visit to Canberra yesterday during his current trip to Australia. I also note that his visit coincided with an icy cold and chilly snap in Canberra. Even though we had the

        predicting a warm and dry winter for Canberra, earlier this week we saw temperatures drop to minus 6.8 degrees. We have also seen a massive dump of snow, which I am sure will see our ski fields packed this weekend.

Before the next election I hope all members of the opposition will put their hands on their hearts, will look at the camera and will swear, 'There'll be no reintroduction of a carbon tax under a government I lead'!
