        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House on the opportunities for Australia flowing from the shift of economic weight to Asia? What is the government's plan to take advantage of these opportunities?

         I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She represents in this parliament an electorate where, I believe, the people truly understand the opportunities that come from the connections we have to Asia in this century. I have had the privilege and pleasure of meeting, through her, a number of her local community groups, who are seized by the opportunities that this century will bring.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having been asked this question by the member for Greenway, let me just reflect on the fact that we stand here today after the delivery of the government's white paper,
         <i>
          Australia in the Asian century
         </i>
         the government's plan to ensure Australia is a winner in the Asian century. The contrast in Australian politics has never been clearer than it now is between a plan for the future and no plan. Our plan for the future, as laid out in the white paper I announced yesterday, is about understanding the dimensions of change in our region and about seizing the opportunities out of it. In the past 20 years China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy. By 2025 Asia as a whole will account for almost half the world's output. Asia will also be home to the world's biggest middle class. The biggest middle class on earth will be in our region. What we have seen so far in our economy with the resources boom is a down payment on the opportunities that we can seize for the future. We, through our resources, have been fuelling the urbanisation of Asia. This burgeoning middle class will now want to buy the kinds of things that Australia has a comparative advantage in. So our task is to keep the economy strong and build on the strengths of our economy for the future—such as the strengths we have in agriculture and the food industry, tourism, legal services, education services, health services, and customised and elaborately transformed manufacturers. And the list goes on.

           <p>
            Australia's economy is strong and we can build on those strengths through the people of Australia having higher skills and the capacities we will need in this century of change and through working with Australian businesses to seize all of the opportunities and potential for this time. I was very proud to deliver that plan for the nation's future yesterday and, day by day, we as a government will be delivering it.
