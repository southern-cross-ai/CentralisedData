        On behalf of all of us in the opposition, we associate ourselves with the eloquent remarks of the previous speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Chapman" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Chapman
        </a>
        , who passed away on 23 May at the age of 85. Phil was a local in the Casey electorate from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandin_East" rel="nofollow">
         Wandin East
        </a>
        . He was the husband of Betty, a father of five and grandfather of 12. He was a very active member of the local community. He was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Wandin since its chartering back in 1984 and was recognised as a Paul Harris Fellow. He participated in all of the club's activities on every occasion. He will be remembered for his cheery grin and for his service over so many years at so many functions and events to assist Rotary and the local community. He was an active member, as you would expect, in so many other organisations. He was a member of the Wandin Silvan Field Days Committee and was previously involved with the Victorian Cherry Growers Association and Silvan growers association. He was also a director of Silvan Fruit Processors Limited and Wandin Valley Farms. On behalf of everyone in the Casey electorate, I pay tribute to him and to members of his family at this sad time.
