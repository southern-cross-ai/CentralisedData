        My question is to the Acting Treasurer. Can the Acting Treasurer outline the importance of passing the government’s budget bills, particularly given the global financial uncertainty?

         I thank the member for Petrie for her question. When the new opposition leader first took office, he extended the hand of bipartisanship to the government and almost in the same breath recommitted the opposition to continuing to tear down the government’s budget in the Senate. In more recent times, notwithstanding the supposed commitment to bipartisanship on the part of the opposition in the very difficult international financial circumstances that Australia finds itself in, we have seen the opposition spreading fear—for example, about the state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private" rel="nofollow">
          Medibank Private
         </a>
         and private health insurers—seriously misrepresenting comments by the Prime Minister, as the shadow Treasurer did only a few days ago, attacking the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         and claiming credit for decisions on interest rates by Australia’s major banks. Malcolm still thinks he is in charge, apparently.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is notable that, notwithstanding the renewal of the rhetoric about bipartisanship by the opposition yesterday, actions have not changed. The position that the government faces in these very difficult circumstances regarding its budget in the Senate is that the opposition thus far remains committed to continuing to punch holes in the government’s surplus, the nation’s insurance policy, in the Senate. In fact, I note that today it has been reported that Senator Steve Fielding has stated that he will support the government’s remaining tax budget bills. Notwithstanding that he does have reservations about some aspects of them and has indicated those reservations previously, he will support those budget bills regarding the taxation of so-called alcopops and the Medicare levy surcharge because of the international financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         for taking this position and I would also indicate that it is the government’s view that the other non-government and non-opposition senators, the Greens and Senator Xenophon, have also taken broadly a responsible position with respect to the government’s budget bills. It is a pity that the so-called alternative government, while extending a purported hand of bipartisanship to the government, on one of the most critical aspects of the nation’s economic policy settings is still seeking to tear down the budget surplus, the nation’s insurance policy, the nation’s buffer against the implications of the global financial crisis, in the Senate. I would urge the opposition to have a think about precisely where it is now positioned. At this stage, the opposition is being given a lesson in economic responsibility by the Greens, by Senator Fielding and by Senator Xenophon. I would urge the opposition to think very carefully about its actions in the Senate. We now have a very difficult situation to deal with in this country where the state of the budget surplus and the government’s budget bills in the Senate are of crucial significance. So, if you want to be bipartisan, how about you start acting like it.
