        I stand today to pay tribute to a brave little girl from Nambour, seven-year-old Olivia Valli. Last week, Olivia was travelling with her mum, Amber, and her two little brothers, Mason and Flynn, when their car crashed off the road. It rolled and eventually came to rest on its side. They all survived. Olivia's mum was badly hurt, but the kids were okay, and little Olivia ensured it stayed that way. She was in the passenger seat and, upon the car coming to rest, she climbed into the back seat. She calmed her younger brothers. She unbuckled them and then wrestled with the door to ensure their safe release. Upon having them released, she went up to the road. She flagged down a passing car, which led to her mum, Amber, being rescued by LifeFlight rescue service, the helicopter service. She is now in Nambour General Hospital. I spoke to Amber last night, and she asked me to pass on to this chamber a very big thank you on her behalf, not only to those who came to her rescue but to the broader

        community who have shown such care and interest in her family. She also wanted to say a very big thank you to her brave little Olivia, that little seven-year-old. I too, on behalf of this chamber, say: 'Well done little girl. You are a little legend.'
