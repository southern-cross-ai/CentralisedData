       <p>
        The Australian coalition government are delivering a stronger economy to create jobs and to guarantee essential services that Australians rely on like health and education. We are providing responsible tax relief started in the budget year for low- and middle-income earners so Australians keep more of their hard-earned income. We also are giving more Australians a lower tax bracket over time to ensure that wages don't get eaten up by higher taxes, with 94 per cent of taxpayers soon to be on no more than a 32Â½ per cent tax rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Dunkley, 63,856 taxpayers stand to benefit from the low- and middle-income tax relief in the upcoming 2018-19 financial year and beyond. That is 63,856 people better off under our plan than under Labor's higher tax plan. For example, a high school teacher in Frankston on $75,000 will have an extra $530 in their pocket from the budget year onwards with an extra $3,740 in their pockets over the first seven years of the tax plan. For a working family in a similar situation, that would be at least $1,060 more in their pockets. A shop assistant on $45,000 in

        will have an extra $444 in their pocket from the budget year onwards with an extra $3,380 in their pocket over time. A hairdresser on $50,000 in Langwarrin will have an extra $530 in their pocket from the budget year onwards with an extra $3,740 in their pocket over time. A take-away fast food operator on $42,000 in Seaford will have an extra $350 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,020 in their pocket over time.

        In stark contrast to the coalition's plan to lower taxes to Australians and allow them to keep more of their hard-earned income, under Labor, in 2024-25 ,a school teacher, comparatively, in Skye will pay $806 more in income tax, a crane operator from

        </a>
        would pay $3,885 more in income tax under Labor. It is clear that we have a plan to give tax relief for hardworking Australians and a stronger economy to deliver essential services through increased revenue. Labor, in comparison, want to cut the everyday battlers' take-home pay and standard of living. They are cutting retiree savings. They are cutting your investment savings. They are cutting your housing savings. Labor are just the party of cuts.
