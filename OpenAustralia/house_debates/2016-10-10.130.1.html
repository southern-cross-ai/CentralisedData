       <p>
        I rise tonight to speak about a few election commitments made by the Turnbull government in the lead-up to the 2016 election. I am raising the promises that were made to ensure that those clubs, associations and councils that were promised funding get their funding. For example, one promise made by the government in the lead-up to the federal election that I want to talk about specifically this evening was the commitment of $3.25 million for the redevelopment of Lockleys Oval in the electorate of Hindmarsh. This was very welcomed by all of us—by me, the community and the people of Hindmarsh. Lockleys Oval is situated on Rutland Avenue in the middle of the electorate in Lockleys. It is a much loved and valued community facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were some doubts thrown onto this particular commitment a couple of weeks ago. On the front page of our local paper,
        <i>
         The Weekly Times,
        </i>
        of 28 September we were shocked to read that the federal government had written to the owners of the oval and the facility there—the West Torrens council—asking for details about the project and questioning its benefit and the benefit of this upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has caused considerable concern amongst the affected residents within my electorate of Hindmarsh and the groups that use this particular oval. Many of these groups were promised this funding: the Lockleys Football Club, one of the largest amateur football clubs in my electorate; the West Torrens Baseball Club Juniors; the West Beach Football Club; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Cricket_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Goodwood Cricket Club
        </a>
        ; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides
        </a>
        ; the Homing Pigeon Club, which also uses the Lockleys community oval; the Tennis Club and the Lockleys Riding Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is all of a sudden some concern that perhaps we are being treated a little bit like Indi—where we heard, before the election, that the much-needed hospital was ripped up from under their noses because the Liberal candidate was not successful. I am hoping this will not be the same in Hindmarsh. There are many other clubs' ovals that were promised money as well. For example, $4 million was promised for the redevelopment of the Edwardstown Soldiers Memorial Recreation Ground, also known as the Edwardstown oval, in the Electorate of Hindmarsh. This recreation ground plays an important role in the lives of the local residents, with both sporting and recreational facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is home to The Towns, one of the oldest and proudest football clubs in the area and is almost 100 years old, and I was very honoured to be at the club a few weeks ago to present trophies to their junior teams. Many other clubs use the Edwardstown oval, including the Edwardstown Bowling Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
         South Road
        </a>
        Cricket Club, the South Coast Cycling Club, the Edwardstown Community Hall Committee and the Edwardstown Junior Sports Club. The Edwardstown oval is a very important and valued fixture in the sporting and social life of the people in my electorate, and this upgrade should absolutely go ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another promise made by the Turnbull government was $750,000 towards the much needed upgrade of the Torrensville Bowling Club, located on South Road, Torrensville, in the Electorate of Hindmarsh. This bowling club has shown great initiative in getting this project up and running. They have a really good redevelopment plan, which is primarily being funded through the merger of two smaller bowling clubs to create a strong, financially viable lawn bowls club with world-class facilities. It is important to note that these facilities will be used not only by its club members but also by those from other bowling clubs, Bowls
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        and the general public.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Torrensville Bowling Club is relying on that government funding commitment, that was made before the last federal election, to establish this facility. So this is another important project that will greatly benefit the wider Hindmarsh community. These community clubs are absolutely vital to our electorate. I wrote today to the Prime Minister asking him to ensure that funding will be given to these clubs.
