        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the minister’s reckless negligence in the administration of his portfolio and his turning of a blind eye to at least 13 warnings about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        kickbacks, resulting in serious damage to the livelihoods of Australian wheat farmers. Will the Deputy Prime Minister now take responsibility for hurting our Aussie wheat farmers? Will he now apologise to these farmers and their families, who are paying the price for his incompetence?

         Order! In calling the Deputy Prime Minister, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that that question contained arguments, epithets and a few other things going to standing order 100. Nonetheless, I will let the question stand, but I would ask future questioners to remember those points.

          I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and absolutely reject any notion of recklessness or any other adjective you might like to apply to the way the government has conducted affairs on behalf of Australian wheat growers for the duration of its time in office. From the outset the government has been very diligent in ensuring that Australian wheat growers’ interests have been looked after every inch of the way as far as this issue is concerned. The current circumstances—and I presume the Leader of the Opposition is referring to a decision announced yesterday—are regrettable, and the government will make representations to the Iraqi government on the decision that was taken yesterday. As far as this whole process is concerned, every time there has been an allegation raised we have pursued it and resolved it.

           My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister’s attention been drawn to an apparent decision of the Iraqi Grains Board to suspend trading with

            I thank the member for Forrest for the question. Yes, of course my attention has been drawn to the reported decision of the Iraqi Grains Board, and I share the concern expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I can inform the House of one or two quite important things. Earlier today I had a telephone conversation with the Chairman of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
             AWB
            </a>
            Ltd, Mr Brendan Stewart, regarding the current tender for wheat in Iraq. I naturally canvassed with him the reported decision of the Iraqi Grains Board and I also had the conversation against the background of the current provisions of the legislation governing the export of Australian wheat, which confer a monopoly on AWB Ltd. We have arranged to meet tomorrow in Canberra. He will be accompanied by the acting managing director of AWB Ltd, and the matter will be discussed.
           </p>
           <p>

            <p>
             Did I say the member for Forrest? I apologise. I thought I was talking about the member for Lindsay, Mr Herbert! I apologise for that slip. I meant to say the member for Mallee, who is a great member for a great wheat-growing district of Australia and a passionate advocate for the interests of Australian wheat growers—as indeed are the member for Grey, the member for O’Connor, the member for Barker, my good friend the member for Gwydir, the member for Riverina, the member for Maranoa and so the list goes on. So too is the member for New England; they grow a bit of wheat there as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me return to the essential grain of the question that was asked by the member for Mallee. I think the House is aware of the provisions of the existing legislation, and that legislation provides effectively a monopoly unless consent is given by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
              AWB
             </a>
             Ltd. On AWB Ltd, I will discuss all aspects of this issue with Mr Stewart tomorrow and that discussion will take place against a very simple proposition: our primary concern is the interests of the Australian wheat growers. The Australian wheat growers’ best friends in this parliament are the Liberal and National parties. Let that be very clearly understood.

               <p>
                I also take the opportunity of saying a couple of things. Inevitably, this issue has raised some debate in the Australian community about the question of a single desk in relation to the sale of Australian wheat. That is an issue which has attracted debate on both sides of the argument. Let me say that it remains the government’s policy to support the existing provisions. There would need to be a very strong national interest case in order to alter that. What we are considering now has to be looked at in isolation from the question of whether that remains an ongoing policy or not. I do not want anything that is said or done in the next little while to be seen to pre-empt a proper and careful consideration of that issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also remind the House of virtually a throwaway line. I have listened to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith. I recall, as many on this side of the House recall, back in 2002. Do you know what the advice of the member for Griffith was—that the government, when it came to Iraq and wheat, should get out of the way and leave it all to

                 My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I refer to his statement to parliament on 7 December last year when he said:

                <p class="italic">
                 All the information that we had was provided to the Volcker inquiry.

                <p>
                 Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the Wheat Export Authority
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                  CEO
                 </a>
                 , Mr Taylor, has just told a Senate estimates committee, ‘The Wheat Export Authority did not provide any information directly through
