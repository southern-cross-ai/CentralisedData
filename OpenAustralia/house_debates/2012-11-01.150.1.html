        On Saturday my wife and I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bentley Park
        </a>
        art and craft fair. Bentley Park is operated by SwanCare, the largest aged-care provider in the electorate. The fair was organised by a committee of seniors, led capably by Beryl, who has organised it for seven years. She announced on Saturday during the awards that she is retiring and handing over the mantle of the committee leadership to a younger member of the aged-care group. Beryl has done a fantastic job, and it was a delight to attend the art and craft fair. As we arrived, they had the usual sausage sizzle and were handing out food out to people who were arriving. I did not partake; I am trying to make sure that I do get to an aged-care facility, so I keep away from fatty sausages and similar foods. We were also accosted and sold some raffle tickets. I do not think that you can go to any aged-care fair in the country without having to buy some raffle tickets! My wife and I were given a voucher for a Devonshire tea, and we shared the scones and coffee with a couple of ladies from the SwanCare facility. They were an absolute delight to spend some time with. We enjoyed their company, and they explained how much they enjoyed living in the SwanCare facility at Bentley Park.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fair included the categories of pottery, painting and floral arrangements. One of the floral arrangements was named 'Sunrise' and it had a little sticker on it that said 'Kiss me Ketut?' I guess that most of us know of the 'Kiss me Ketut?' advertising around Australia; the lady in the advertisement came from Western Australia. We had to donate the raffle tickets. They were not drawing the raffle until the next day, so we gave the raffle tickets to a couple of people there.

        Within Beverley Park, residents have access to cafes, an op shop, a medical centre, a hair and beauty salon, outdoor and indoor bowling greens, an auditorium, computer facilities, a library, a supermarket and a number of transfer services which stop at Bentley Park every 10 minutes and which help the residents keep in touch with the broader community. Also visiting on the day was

        This weekend in my electorate is the 2012 show of the Canning Agricultural, Horticultural &amp; Recreational Society. It runs from Friday at 5 pm to Saturday at 10 pm. I am encouraging everyone in my electorate to go down and visit. Last year there were over 11,000 visitors to the show, even though there is no longer much agriculture, horticulture and recreation going on within the Canning area. I acknowledge that the member for Banks is getting everyone ready for a division, but I will quickly quote a couple of words from the welcome written by the President of the Canning Agricultural, Horticultural &amp; Recreational Society. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Canning Agricultural Horticultural and Recreational Society, welcome to the 2012 Canning show.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year we are celebrating the Magic of the Show. We will be conjuring in the kitchen, charming the vegetables, fruit and flowers and enchanting the young and the young at heart.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society" rel="nofollow">
         The Society
        </a>
        has secured top class entertainment for the 2012 programme, the centre stage will be filled with music, dance and of courseâ€”magic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once again our exhibition halls are a showpiece, receiving entries from regular participants and first timers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Canning may no longer have agricultural lands, but we continue the connection with rural life in a lot of ways. This show continues to do so.
