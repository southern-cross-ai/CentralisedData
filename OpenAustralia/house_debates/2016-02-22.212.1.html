       <p>
        On the last sitting day I announced that I would not be contesting the next federal election and stood down as Deputy Prime Minister and as Leader of the Nationals. I want to take my 90 seconds today to say thank you to the very many people who have extended to me very generous good wishes on that decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was particularly moved by the comments of my colleagues in the House of Representatives from both sides, and very much appreciated the generosity of their words. It certainly made me appreciate what a privilege it is and what wonderful people we have to work with in the parliamentâ€”people who are committed to building a better country. I think our only disagreement around the parliament is not that we do not all want a better country but just how those objectives should be achieved. I have also particularly appreciated the many good wishes I have received in my electorate and from around the country. I have to say I enjoyed last week when I was visiting and attending quite a number of functions within my electorate, and I am looking forward to spending time with my electorate, over the remainder of the term, talking to them about the issues that are of importance to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has now been 40 years since I was first elected as a representative for my community, and it has been a wonderful privilege and opportunity to serve in those offices. And the wonderful colleagues I have had to work with during that period have made it very rewarding for me. Thank you.
