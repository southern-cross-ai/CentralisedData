       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 26 May 2008 enclosing a petition from residents of Victoria about planning control and the proposed closure and redevelopment of the golf course at Moorabbin Airport.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       <i>
        1. Golf Course
       </i>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I have given careful consideration to matters raised by Kingston City Council and members of the community concerning the impact of development on the site currently leased by the Council for the Moorabbin Golf Course.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       As residents may be aware, the lease negotiated by the Council in 1998 expires in November 2008.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Airports Act 1996 (the Act), Moorabbin Airport Corporation (MAC) is required to submit a new Master Plan for my consideration by August 2009.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       At a meeting, I accepted MAC’S offer to bring forward the public release of the preliminary draft Master Plan to October 2008 to allow for a longer period for submissions. This will allow for a more comprehensive and robust consultation with airport stakeholders —State and local governments, and the community at large. I have encouraged the airport to work constructively with all stakeholders in considering options for the future.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The consultative process included in the development of the Master Plan provides an excellent opportunity for all interested parties to participate in the planning process and to contribute to a successful, viable outcome for the site.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       <i>
        2. Inquiry into arrangements at privatised airports
       </i>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia’s long-term planning for the sustainable growth of its aviation industry will be informed through the development of a National Aviation Policy Statement or White Paper in mid 2009 to guide the industry’s growth over the next decade and beyond.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The White Paper will consider a range of issues and challenges currently facing the aviation industry, including issues such as the ones raised in the petition.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I note that several parties with an interest in the future of Moorabbin Airport have made submissions to the development of the National Aviation Policy Green Paper.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       <i>
        3. Planning Control
       </i>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I note the residents’ view that the Australian Government should require non-aviation related developments at leased federal airports to conform to local planning schemes.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Planning control on leased federal airports is vested in the Government under the Act, as these airports are essential elements of our national economic infrastructure and they are on Commonwealth land. Recent amendments of the Act place increased obligations on MAC to closely consult with state and local planning authorities when developing its planning strategy.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       MAC is not required to submit a preliminary draft Major Development Plan (MDP) for a proposed development to the state or local government for an assessment by its planning agency. However, in a preliminary draft MDP, MAC is required to address the extent of consistency with planning schemes in force under a law of the state or territory where the airport is located.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Further, during the consultation phase of a preliminary draft MDP or Master Plan, it is open to a state/territory or local government to have its planning agency conduct an assessment of the proposal and include the outcome of that assessment in a submission to MAC. In addition to the statutory matters that I must consider when the draft MDP is submitted, I am able to take into account issues raised in the submissions made to MAC through the public consultation process and issues raised in correspondence with me.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I note that in response to public submissions, the MAC’s 2004 Draft Master Plan specifically includes a schedule of land use zones expressed in terms consistent with Victorian planning terminology and the inclusion of guidelines and assessment processes for land use decision making.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I will consider the concerns raised as part of the Moorabbin Airport Master Plan process. However, I also encourage residents to make a submission when the draft Master Plan is released for public comment.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for raising this matter.
      </p>
