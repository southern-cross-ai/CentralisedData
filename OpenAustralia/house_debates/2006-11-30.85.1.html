       <p>
        On Saturday, 3 December, at 11.15 am, the 11th memorial service for merchant mariners will be held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Norah Head
        </a>
        . This service is held on the first Saturday of December every year at the Norah Head Merchant Mariners Memorial to commemorate the significant role played by merchant mariners on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        in defending Australia during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . I have invited interested people to attend the service to remember and honour the invaluable service of merchant mariners. During the war, one in nine merchant mariners perished. We must all recognise the debt that all Australians owe regarding the great contribution made by our merchant mariners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The service holds special significance for families and friends of those mariners who died when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV" rel="nofollow">

        <i>

        sank after striking a mine on 5 December 1940. The
        <i>
         Nimbin
        </i>
        was the first vessel to be sunk by enemy action off Australia’s east coast in

        . In fact, we will have two survivors, Don Burchell and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Harris" rel="nofollow">

        had struck a mine laid days before by the German raider
        <i>
         Pinguin
        </i>
        . Seven of the crew of 20 of the
        <i>
         Nimbin
        </i>
        , including its captain, Captain Byzantson, went down with the ship. On Saturday, the coastguard from

        Maritime and possibly the Water Police, will be in attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ceremony this year will be very special because a flotilla of boats will be assembled off the headland at Norah Head. The boats will move to the position where the MV
        <i>
         Nimbin
        </i>
        sank, place a wreath on the water and observe one minute’s silence. The service will be broadcast to ships up and down the coast of New South Wales. I would encourage people to attend, as I feel it is very important that Australians recognise the significant heroism of merchant mariners during World War II.

       <p>
        I would like to thank all those who have been involved in organising this service, particularly Graeme Bissaker from Tuggerah Lakes Volunteer Coast Guard, as he has been instrumental in helping to arrange for the coastguard to be located off Norah Head; members of the Merchant Mariners Organising Committee; the Norah Head Lighthouse Trust; Lyndal Bailey from the
