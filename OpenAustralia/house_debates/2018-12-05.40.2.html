        Today is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Volunteer_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Volunteer Day
        </a>
        , and on every International Volunteer Day across the Bendigo electorate we like to acknowledge some of the superstars in our community. To begin with, though, if all of our volunteers across central Victoria stopped doing what they do, then literally the whole of our community would stop. Our volunteers are the lifeblood of so many of our communities. That's why I'm really proud today to acknowledge Karen Whillance. Karen is a volunteer at the Bendigo Health Emergency Department. I would also like to acknowledge Shannon Appleby. Shannon works tirelessly for headspace in their inclusion program. What Shannon wants to see is more support that engages young people in diverse groups. I would also like to acknowledge Tom Nicholson from the Bendigo Umpires Association and the North Bendigo Junior Football Club for ensuring that everybody gets an opportunity to play sport. Then there is Trevor Butcher, who is the president of the camp reserve committee. Trevor makes sure that, when the Loddon Prison day release program comes every second Friday, they have a trained supervisor and support. I would also like to acknowledge 'the warrior', Karen O'Sullivan, who is the president of the Kyneton Football Netball Club. She is the first female president in 150 years. This sends the message that anybody can be involved in leadership and be a leader of their sports community. They are just a few of our many superstar volunteers.
