        Let me remind the House that he voted against same-sex marriage. He voted against tobacco plain packaging. He voted against the carbon price. He voted against increasing the scrutiny of asylum seeker management. He voted against implementation of refugee protection. He voted strongly against the protection of Australia's fresh water. He voted strongly against increasing marine conservation. He also voted strongly against restricting foreign ownership, strongly against increasing investment in renewable energy, and against increasing Aboriginal land rights. He also voted strongly against increasing funding for university education. He voted strongly against keeping the indexation of pensioner support payments in line with
