        Next Saturday is election day in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . What a great day! I have four of the best local Labor candidates running in my area: Jason Yat-Sen Li, in Strathfield; Julia Little, in Drummoyne; Donna Davis, in Parramatta; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynda_Voltz" rel="nofollow">
         Lynda Voltz
        </a>
        , in Auburn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since coming into office, the member for Strathfield, Jason Li, has not wasted a day. He is out and about, listening to the concerns of residents and business owners. There are three things I know about Jason. He is incredibly hardworking, super smart and committed to serving the community. It's what he has done for much of his adult life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of all of the Labor candidates in my area, I've known Julia Little, the Labor candidate for Drummoyne, the longest. In the 15 years I've known her, I've been impressed by her commitment to serving the local community. She is a local mum and councillor and has spent years working to make our community a better place. Every time I walk down the main street with her, people stop Julia to thank her for fixing one of their issues or to let her know about an issue that they have. She is accessible and responsive and cares deeply about the community she has lived in her whole life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayor of Parramatta and Labor candidate Donna Davis is a true local champion. We've been working closely together to help fix key issues in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wentworth_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Wentworth Point
        </a>
        . I've been really pleased to work with her to upgrade
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Hill Road
        </a>
        in Wentworth Point. For years, local residents have been asking for a set of traffic lights at the intersection of Hill Road and Bennelong Parkway. The traffic is terrible and there are near misses and crashes every day. It took a Labor mayor and a Labor federal member of parliament to finally deliver on this much-needed upgrade. I'm proud to see that work has already begun on that intersection. That's what locals are going to get with Donna Davisâ€”someone who is acting to make their lives better.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Auburn, Lynda Voltz, is a fighter for her community. She is a wonderful advocate for local organisations and is well known throughout her electorate. I'm really grateful to her for her friendship and generosity since I've become the member for Reid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jason, Julia, Donna and Lynda are part of the Minns Labor team. After 12 years in government, the New South Wales coalition do not deserve another four. They have neglected essential services in the state. Our hospitals are understaffed, our teachers are leaving the profession and ambulance waiting times have blown out. It's only the Minns team that have a positive plan to repair our health system, act to help with the cost of living and back local manufacturing to create jobs. They have a positive plan for New South Wales.
