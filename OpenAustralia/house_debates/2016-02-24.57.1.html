        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister please update the House on the government's response to Cyclone Winston in the Pacific?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Petrie for his question and note his concern not only for the people of the Pacific islands but also for the constituents of Pacific island origin that he has in his electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tropical Cyclone Winston is the strongest ever recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Fiji. There were wind gusts of up to 325 kilometres an hour, causing widespread damage, flooding and power outages not just in Fiji but also in Tonga. The government of Fiji has confirmed that there have been 36 deaths and 35,000 people are still taking refuge in evacuation centres. Our thoughts are with the people of Fiji at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         About 350,000 Australians visit Fiji each year, and I can confirm that, thankfully, there are no recorded Australian casualties. We do have consular officers who are in Fiji at present and can assist any Australians in need. Prime Minister Turnbull has spoken with his counterpart, Prime Minister Bainimarama, and I have been in constant contact with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Kubuabola. We have offered our deepest sympathies and our support to the people of Fiji.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can confirm that Australia's immediate response was to release prepositioned supplies in Fiji. It is a $5 million humanitarian package comprising food, water and sanitation supplies as well as shelter.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also been able to send four Defence helicopters. They are currently in Fiji and will be taking supplies to some of the outlying islands. We have also sent two

          P3 Orion
         </a>
         surveillance aircraft, and they will be carrying out daily assessments of the damage, particularly in those outlying islands.
        </p>
        <p>
         In coordination with the government of Fiji, we have also sent a six-person team of Australian medics who are currently carrying out life-saving treatments and other health and medical assistance. We have sent a 16-person crisis response team, working with the government of Fiji and coordinating the response.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also been in touch with other Pacific island leaders and are working with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         , particularly, as the chair of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islands Forum
         </a>
         , so that there is a coordinated regional response.
        </p>
        <p>
         The commercial airlines are back flying. We have two immigration officers to assist Australians seeking to leave or come into Fiji. We are also pleased to confirm that Australian businesses operating in Fiji—Telstra, Optus,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZ" rel="nofollow">
          ANZ
         </a>
         and Westpac—are providing assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are longstanding and firm friends of Fiji and we are there in their hour of need.
