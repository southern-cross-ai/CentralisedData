        I move:

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: OneSKY Perth Air Traffic Services Centreâ€”Modernisations works.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        and the Department of Defence are planning to replace their existing air traffic control systems with a new civil-military air traffic management system to provide a common platform for provision of air traffic control in both civilian and military controlled airspace. The current air traffic services centre in Perth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        supports the delivery of air traffic management services by air traffic controllers from both Airservices and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        , as well as office administration space and facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        To support the successful deployment of the civil-military air traffic management system, this project is to modernise the current air traffic services centre in Perth. The refurbishment will extend the life of the building for a further 20 years and upgrade the existing supporting infrastructure to enable delivery of the civil-military air traffic management system. The modernisation of the Perth air traffic services centre will ensure availability, reliability and capacity of mechanical and electrical infrastructure for both future and current needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perth has experienced record increases in air traffic over the past 10 years, and this traffic is expected to continue to rise significantly over the next 20 years. The proposed works include a new plant room, an upgrade and reconfiguration of the existing buildings and infrastructure, and an upgrade to the fire protection system. The proposal also includes upgrades to the existing site security systems, together with a closed circuit television system and a new perimeter fence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed works are scheduled to commence in late 2015 and be completed by early 2017. I commend the motion to the House.
