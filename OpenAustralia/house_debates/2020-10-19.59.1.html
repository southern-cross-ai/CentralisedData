       <p>
        I'd like to highlight the efforts of the Macleay Valley Landcare group and, in particular, one Landcare member's goal to rehydrate the landscape. Bruce Raeburn owns about 800 acres of cattle country at Moparrabah, which is just near Kempsey in my electorate. I walked across Bruce's property on Friday with about 10 other Landcare members and some of his neighbours. For more than 10 years, Bruce has worked to improve his property's creek catchment. He's planted native trees and shrubs in strategic places along the creek's bank. He's also built a riparian fence to keep the cattle out. Now the water flows slower and the water holes are deeper, which has improved fish life and biodiversity. Gradually, due to the water's slower flow, silt and gravel have been deposited into the creek bed, which has gradually raised its height. Bruce hopes that, in a flood, and in the future, the creek's waters will flow across his property—600 acres of flat property—which will water his pecan and poplar trees. Bruce's efforts have improved his own property. It now carries 300 breeders instead of 100 due to the pasture being improved. On a broader scale, Bruce hopes he's doing his bit to tackle the drying effects of climate change. Thank you, Bruce, for the tour across your property and for being so generous to share your knowledge through Landcare.
