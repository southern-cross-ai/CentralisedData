         I thank the member for Macarthur for raising a very important question. As he well knows, Australia is a country that is built on citizenship. Citizenship is the common bond for all Australians, whether we are Australian by birth or by choice, and it's something that lies at the heart of a unified, cohesive and inclusive nation. We in the Albanese government recognise that there are many
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealanders
         </a>
         here on special category visas who have been stuck without a clear pathway to citizenship, despite their contributions, despite very significant contributions—raising families, working, paying taxes and building lives in this country. That is why on 1 July we opened the direct pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealand citizens living in Australia, and all special category visa holders are now able to apply directly for citizenship as long as they meet the residency and other standard requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was so delighted to be with my friend the member for Lalor on Saturday to welcome the first couple to become Australian citizens under the new pathway. I'd like to share a little of their story. Mr and Mrs Kingy, Rio and Teresa, have lived in Australia since 2007, having come here to work and to find new opportunities. Since then, as small business owners, for the past 13 years they have contributed to the local community, paid taxes and also employed Australians—for more than a decade. But, despite this great contribution, until now they haven't really been able to call Australia home. As Mrs Kingy said to me on Saturday, 'It's actually a real privilege to become Australian citizens after so long. For our family and our friends, we just wanted to set the example and put it out there that it's not so hard anymore.' What a beautiful and affirming message.
        </p>
        <p>
         And it doesn't end there, because yesterday a citizenship ceremony was held right here in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         to mark Australian Citizenship Day later this week. A further 13 New Zealanders acquired Australian citizenship at the ceremony, including Eli and Katherine, two Kiwis who came to Australia for a better life for them and their families. For Katherine, the pathway means she'll finally be able to fully be part of the Australian community, after moving here for love. For Eli, who moved here almost 20 years ago for his son's rugby league career, it provides him with the certainty that he'll be able to stay here and watch his grandchildren grow up.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's only fair that our closest friends and allies are able to be full members of our community. In the coming months we will be seeing more and more Kiwi families celebrating. I'm pleased that nearly 3,500 New Zealanders have already passed the citizenship test. Of course, all of this is possible because of the work that we have done on citizenship processing, with wait times decreasing more than 50 per cent since we came to government. This landmark pathway is changing lives for the better. It serves to further strengthen the bond between

         </a>
         and of course our local communities too.
