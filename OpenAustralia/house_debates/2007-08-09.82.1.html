        On 27 July this year I was privileged to attend the dinner marking the 50th anniversary of the Australian

        , was made a patron on that night and my congratulations go to her; she has had a long association with the squadron. The Riverwood squadron was established in 1957 and it represents one of the Air League squadrons established for the benefit of young people aged eight years or more. In addition to aviation education, they instil community values by getting young people involved in community events and fundraising. The organisation also develops ingenuity and resourcefulness in its members. Indeed, a cadet from the Riverwood squadron, Ian Kent, was honoured by the City of Canterbury as its 2007 young citizen of the year. This award is for community service and leadership. Ian represents the values and traditions of the Air League.

        and Sir Keith Smith and others were household names and heroes. On 1 August 1934, the Australian Air League was incorporated, with Mr George Robey as one of the signatories. Mr Robey was an original Anzac and he had a connection with this place. In 1927 he assisted in the ceremonial opening of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

        , and the Riverwood Hornets were no exception.

       <p>
        Riverwood Hornets has a proud history. As recently as June this year, the Riverwood squadron gained first place in the New South Wales boys groups ceremonial parade for boys best squadron, first place for boys best band, and second place for boys best flight and for the boys best drum-major. I would like to congratulate those who have passed through the Riverwood Air League over the past 50 years. I would also like to pass on my particular congratulations to

        , the officer commanding the squadron. The Australian Air League have become part of Australiaâ€™s future, being recognised in the aviation industry and armed services as the primary school of aviation. They have done their area proud, they have done their parents proud, and the seeds have been sown in relation to each of these children to make outstanding citizens in this country.
