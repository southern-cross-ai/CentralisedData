        My question is to the Minister for Government Services. What questions remain unanswered arising from the Watt review into contracts and procurements?

         Members of the House will recall that late last year, and again this year, there have been disturbing reports in the

         about the undeclared and very active relationship between de facto Canberra lobbying firm Synergy 360 and the outgoing member for Fadden. Following these articles, the heads of my agencies initiated an inquiry. The inquiry by Dr Watt identified 19 contracts worth $374 million requiring further examination. He explained that the review only had the ability to look at one side of the contracts, that of the public officials but not that of the vendors, former ministers, MPs or their officers. Subsequently the member for Bruce has chaired the JCPAA and is looking at these most concerning matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         A common thread across the undisclosed conflicts of interest, valuable government contracts and Synergy 360 and special access is the outgoing member for Fadden. He has tendered his resignation, but crucial questions remain unanswered. What role did the member for Fadden play in coaching commercial interests seeking special access to Commonwealth contracts? Did the member for Fadden supply the same insider knowledge of government to any of his other 100,000 constituents? Did the member for Fadden ever directly or indirectly seek to or receive a financial benefit from Synergy 360? Is there still a potential benefit owed to him? What is the member for Fadden's previous and current interest in the Australian Property Trust? Is he the beneficiary of any other trust or structures controlled by individuals linked to Synergy 360? What agreement did the member for Fadden and his fundraiser John Margerison have in relation to profits derived from Synergy 360?

         There is a further report in today's

         that notes it's not just the government who feel there are questions to be answered. Eminent legal professionals believe these matters need to be looked into by an investigative body with the power to compel evidence and witnesses. Justice Anthony Whealy

         all agree that the actions and issues around this warrant further investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note in closing that the member for Fadden has unusually said that he won't come to parliament to deliver a valedictory speech because he considers it a vanity projectâ€”not even a thankyou to his electors. I do not believe that these actions are the way that 98 per cent of the people in this House conduct themselves, but I do believe that the member for Fadden owes the people and his coalition colleagues, all of those opposite, an explanation as to what he did and why he did it.
