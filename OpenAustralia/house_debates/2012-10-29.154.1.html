         Last Thursday
        </a>
        a jobs expo was held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . I was very fortunate to have the expo held in Shortland electorate. It was a fantastic event. Firstly, I would like to put on record my thanks to all the people in the departments that were involved in the organisation and setting up the jobs expo. I would then like to thank all those people that came along: exhibitors, employers with jobs—and there were over 600 local jobs up for grabs on the day—and also those organisations that came along and supported job seekers. We had over 3,100 people come through on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an absolutely outstanding success. There were people that actually obtained jobs on the day and over the next couple of weeks I will find out how many jobs were filled because of the expo. In addition to local jobs, there were jobs from around Australia. There was some interest in that from locals who were looking for work outside our area. There was a lot of information on training and obtaining skills that people need to find the job that they need. It was really good, because it provided the whole-of-person approach to employment. For people who are just starting to engage in the process of looking for work there were organisations that provide personal support, followed by organisations that provide training and then by organisations that provide placement. I thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        at Charlestown for attending on the day and providing a sausage sizzle. I know that was appreciated by many people that attended.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude by thanking absolutely everybody that was involved with the day. I was extremely encouraged by the number of people that came along to look for work. It was one of the most outstanding events that I have had the pleasure to be associated with in my electorate. I congratulate the ministers. Minister Carr, Minister for Human Services, was present on the day and I thank him very much for the support that he provided and for taking nearly two hours out to spend at the expo. Thanks to everybody who was involved.
