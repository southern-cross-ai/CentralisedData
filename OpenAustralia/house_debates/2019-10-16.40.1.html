       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to a special member of our community in the Ryan electorate: Patricia Weatherstone, a passionate golfer, a former staff member in my office and an all-round wonderful lady. We all know that in this place we are nothing without our staff. Patricia, when she worked in my office, was the very model of a professional community servant. She was forever patient in assisting local residents. She cared deeply for them and their issues, and they, in turn, cared deeply for her.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal level, working closely together with Patricia for many years was an absolute privilege. I treasured her wise counsel, her diligence and her loyalty, and I'm certain I would not be in this place without all of her hard work over those many years. I was very lucky to have Patricia by my side in my profession life for as long as I did. On many occasions, she was the glue that held our little office operation together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Patricia is now enjoying some well-earned family time with her daughter, Lisa, and her first grandchild, Hunter. As disappointed as I am not to have her in the office, I am pleased she is enjoying that family time. Patricia, thank you for all of those years of service. Thank you for your guidance and friendship. I hope this small tribute in the national parliament demonstrates how valued and missed you are by me and the whole team.
