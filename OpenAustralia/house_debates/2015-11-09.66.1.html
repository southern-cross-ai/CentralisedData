        My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that various advocates within the Prime Minister's party have suggested that an increased
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        could pay for cutting personal income tax, cutting business tax, compensating pensioners, funding schools and hospitals, and paying down national debt, will the Prime Minister please explain what exactly his 15 per cent GST will pay for?

         I thank the honourable member for what appears to be the beginning of a not especially scary scare campaign to date. But I am glad he has identified that there is a diversity of views in our party—yes, there is.

           from his own state of Victoria. The animosity towards the goods and services tax—of course, we all remember the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the introduction of which as being 'fundamental injustice day', memorably, some years ago—that antipathy towards the GST is not shared by all of his colleagues. Regrettably, from the honourable member's point of view, not all of his colleagues' former writings have been purged. The Stalinism is not as efficient as it used to be, apparently. I note from 2004, the member for Fraser said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … Howard's eight years have been marked by some strong policy initiatives.… The GST was radical for Australia, and in a broader context it brought us in line with the rest of the developed world.

What the government is doing is seeking to ensure that we can maintain strong growth so that our children and our grandchildren will have even better opportunities in the future than we have had. The way we do that is by going about the business of government in an open and consultative way.

               There is something to be said for retro fashion; but, really, the honourable member seems to be living in the past. The Australian people are not interested in that type of blame game politics. What they want to know is that there is a major debate, that government is listening, that Australians are participating and that we will have a fully-informed debate on these important issues.
