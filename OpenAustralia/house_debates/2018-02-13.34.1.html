       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to and say farewell to Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Roberts
        </a>
        who passed away aged 92 on Sunday night. Bill Roberts was chairman and mayor of the Murgon shire for 28 years and earned an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
         OBE
        </a>
        for his service to local government. He's better known as 'Mr Murgon', renowned for his dedicated service to the community. Bill was a member of Apex and Rotary, a member and chairman of the Murgon ambulance and fire brigade boards and a member of Fraser Coast Tourism Board and Wide Bay Burnett Area Consultative Committee and many other groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill started his tax agency in 1967 and retired when he turned 90. He had his finger firmly on the pulse locally and at a state and federal level, reporting his observations and insights in his regular 'Hub Rattles' column in the
        <i>
         South Burnett Times
        </i>
        for an incredible 58 years, perhaps the longest-running column in the world. I knew Bill only briefly, first meeting him at the Murgon Castra Aged Care Centre, and I saw him at the Murgon's Country Music Festival not so long ago. I always appreciated his reliable and sage advice. His legacy will live on in his local community. I convey my condolences to his wife, Mary, and his children, Scott, Kay and Swain.
