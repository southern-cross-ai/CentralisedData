        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present report No. 2 of 2015 entitled
        <i>
         Referrals made December 2014
        </i>
        , and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report deals with two matters: the fit-out of new lease premises for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Replacement Fire Station Project. Sadly, I missed the inspection of the new Department of Finance building, but even more sadly I missed out on going to Hamilton Island to look at the replacement fire station project. Some committee members were able to make it along but I went up to Cairns with another committee to deal with another cyclone. The inspection was ably handled by Mr Goodenough, the member for Moore, and was oversighted by the former chair of the committee Mrs Karen Andrews, the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make a few comments about her role as chair, because, whilst she has been promoted, she is sorely missed by the committee. We wish her all the best in her new endeavours. She was a wonderful chair and will be missed by the Public Works Committeeâ€”and that is not taking away from Senator Dean Smith, who will be taking over as chair. On behalf of the committee, I wish her all the best.

        In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a Parliamentary Paper.
