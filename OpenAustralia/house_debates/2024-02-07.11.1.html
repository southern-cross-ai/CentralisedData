        I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring in relation to proceedings on the Treasury Laws Amendment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_Living" rel="nofollow">
         Cost of Living
        </a>
        Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) on Wednesday, 7 February when the order of the day relating to the second reading debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 is called on following the conclusion of the matter of public importance, a cognate debate taking place with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024, and continuing without interruption until no further Members rise to speak, or the commencement of the adjournment debate at 7.30 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notwithstanding standing order 31, if the second reading debate has not concluded earlier, at 8 pm the adjournment debate being interrupted and the bills being called on for further consideration, with the second reading debate continuing until:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) no further Members rise to speak; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) 10 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        at which point, debate being adjourned and the House immediately adjourning until Thursday, 8 February at no earlier than 9.45 am;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) any variation to this arrangement being made only on a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        In supporting the motion, I advise members of the normal arrangements. This is being done to try to make sure that everybody who wants to speak on this tax bill—and the list already includes 50 people, and I expect it will continue to go up—can do so without the debate being curtailed in any way and without having to reduce people's speaking times. As the list grows, I wouldn't be surprised if we had some additional nights next week as well, but I'll keep an eye on the list to make sure we can manage the debate in a way that allows everybody to speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        We obviously have minimal government business time tomorrow because of the address from Prime Minister Marape. I also remind members that the 6.30 rule, as usual, applies here, so for those who are not speaking there is no reasonable requirement for all of their staff to continue to be here beyond 6.30 unless the member gives a particular direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
