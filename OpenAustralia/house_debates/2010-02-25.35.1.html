        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, at least 24 per cent, or nearly 240,000, of the one million homes insulated under the disastrous home insulation scheme are now known to have faulty and unsafe insulation installed. Why does the Prime Minister’s inspection program only include 15 per cent of these one million homes?

         I thank the member for Hume for his question. I am certain he is also asking that question based on the interests of his constituents. Firstly, I would say in response to the honourable member’s question that the government will check as many Australian homes as is necessary. Secondly, I would say in response to the honourable member’s question that householders who have foil insulation can get their homes checked right now and do so at the government’s expense. Every householder can right now contact a licensed electrician to conduct a safety inspection of their home. Householders will not be put out of pocket for any inspection or rectification works because the electrician will be paid directly by the government. Thirdly, this is available to any householder right now.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of non-foil insulation, can I add to my answer to the question posed by the member for Hume. Most of the installations of non-foil insulation—that is, pink batts—were conducted by reputable firms. I am advised that there, of course, have been a number of shonky operators who have done substandard installations. I am advised that more than 92 per cent of roof inspections have identified no safety issues whatsoever and that this is 92 per cent of a sample partly targeted to identified risks in the community. The government will target these homes for inspection first. This risk based audit will be extended further if necessary to any segments of household deemed to be at risk. As I said yesterday, any individual household that, having obtained an inspection by a reregistered home insulation installer, is not happy with that can contact the government direct and a further inspection will be undertaken.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for the future, the standards which will apply forward for insulation installers will be as follows: all installers will be required to be reregistered, all will be required to pay a cash bond, all will be required to show evidence of meeting the training and skills requirements which the government has established and all will be required to provide certified quality assurance and occupational health and safety plans. That is the advice that I have received.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also, in response to the member for Hume, add this to my answer concerning the standards which apply to the industry, both for training and quality. Under the Home Insulation Program, the government introduced more regulation to the industry than had applied ever before to the insulation industry: firstly, the first national skills requirements for installation contractors; secondly, the first accredited training courses for installers to be put in place; and, thirdly, the first occupational health and safety standards for the insulation industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the member for Hume, in terms of dealing with the practical problems on the ground for his constituents and the constituents of other members here: we will deal with each of these practical problems as they arise, both for workers, for installers who run good companies, as well as for householders and the concerns they have. I look forward to any representations from the member for Hume or any members opposite in terms of particular concerns in their electorates.
