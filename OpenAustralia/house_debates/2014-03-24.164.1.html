       <p>
        Last Saturday the Mooroolbark community again hosted the Celebrate Mooroolbark Festival at the Red Earth Park and Mooroolbark Community Centre. It is a wonderful annual event that brings together local schools, businesses, community groups and many others in a low-cost environment with entertainment for people of all ages. Throughout the day there was a parade, a full stage program, roving performers, kids activities, workshops, rides and food stalls. It was a tremendous event.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hardworking community and a hardworking committee ensures that this event is a success each and every year. I want to pay tribute to the chair of the event,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lang" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Lang
        </a>
        ; to the vice-chairs, Randall Bourchier, Barbara Austin, Liz Ryan; to the secretary, Jean Mitchinson; and to the tireless treasurer, Margaret Goldup, who does so much for the group as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of the local schools were involved in the parade and involved throughout the day playing music on the stage. I pay tribute to Pembroke Primary School, Bimbadeen Heights Primary School, Gladesville Primary School, Manchester Primary School and the Mount Evelyn Special Development School. Also involved in the parade were Yarra Ranges Scouts and Mooroolbark Girl Guides. For those members here who have young children, they would be pleased to know that renowned children's author
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffiths" rel="nofollow">

        was there at lunchtime. I pay tribute to him, too, because he spent a good hour signing autographs for all of his young fans that have read his many books, including
        <i>
         The 13-Story Treehouse
        </i>
        and the like. He was there at a community centre right through lunch.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a completely separate topic I do want to correct the public record. Second Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you would be aware that last Wednesday night week at our Carlton in Canberra function——where I, along with you, spoke—I made a statement that, of the four of us hosting the event, I was the only member to have actually played for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Carlton Football Club
        </a>
        , albeit in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League" rel="nofollow">
         Little League
        </a>
        . I have since learned that in fact the Second Deputy Speaker also played in the Little League at about the same time. It is something we have in common. I think what I can say on behalf of both of us is that that time represented the peak of our football career.
