        Briefly, this motion is being moved by the government in order to facilitate the appointment of the Independent member for Lyne to this committee. The member for Lyne has expressed an interest in it as a priority committee for him to serve on. As members would be aware, Independent members in the chamber are recognised as non-government members when it comes to committee positions. The opposition, up to this point, has not facilitated membership of the committee for the member for Lyne. Hence the government is taking this action in order to make sure that that is rectified. I commend the motion that I have moved to the House. I understand it has been the subject of discussion between the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip and will therefore receive the consensus support of the House.
