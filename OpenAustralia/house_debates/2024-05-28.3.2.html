        , together with the minutes of the proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to Australia's oceans and waterways due to the harm that it causes to marine and freshwater life and ecosystems. Without urgent action, the presence of plastic waste will continue to escalate and negatively impact the natural environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of our daily activities and routines involve plastic. Everything from our morning coffees to our fresh fruit shopping produces as significant level of plastic waste that is almost impossible for consumers to avoid. Different types and labelling of plastics mean that managing plastic waste present a real challenge for consumers, industry and governments. Importantly, for many uses, there are no real substitutes for plastics.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 20 million Australians have participated in clean-up activities and events over the past three decades. Community campaigns are valuable ways to raise awareness and promote behavioural change to reduce plastic pollution. Unfortunately, this isn't enough without addressing plastic pollution at its source.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee examined Australia's current approach to managing and preventing plastic pollution, with a focus on the policies under the National Plastics Plan, as well as state and territory approaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inquiry revealed areas where policies are inadequate to the scale of the problem and identified opportunities to drive meaningful progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee made 22 recommendations that go to the heart of strengthening Australia's plastics management framework: to minimise plastic waste ending up in our oceans and waterways; incentivise the use of recycled materials in the production of new plastics; and strengthen management of the plastics that are already in the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the major findings of this inquiry was that Australia's current National Plastics Plan is a disjointed collection of goals. Some of these goals were already completed prior to the plan being developed and others were not completed by their expected deadline. Australia needs an updated National Plastics Plan. This should be developed in consultation with state and territory governments, industry, and the community, and coordinated nationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is currently cheaper and easier to use virgin polymers rather than recycled materials in plastic products. This is mainly due to the higher cost and lower quality of recycled materials, and the lack of incentives in place. As well as this, with the waste export ban in place and a limited end market for reclaimed plastic, the lower value of recycled plastics means that they are not being used.
       </p>
       <p>
        Responsibility for plastics must be shifted back onto the manufacturers of the plastics. The committee has recommended that plastic manufacturers should take responsibility for minimising their environmental footprint through extended producer responsibility schemes. An incentive or mandate should be in place for plastic manufacturers to incorporate a minimum of 30 per cent recycled content in new plastics. This should be increased progressively to 50 per cent recycled content by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the committee has recommended the development of a sustainable end market for recycled materials to stimulate demand for products with recycled plastic content. This is important to mitigating plastic pollution and fostering a sustainable plastics industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians want to recycle correctly. However, inconsistencies amongst states and territories have caused confusion. This impedes the recycling process because contaminated materials are difficult to sort and recycle effectively. Non-recyclable items can damage equipment and reduce the efficiency of recycling facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has recommended that the Australian government leads the national harmonisation of single-use plastic bans; waste collection standards; the container deposit scheme; and standardisation of packaging and recycling labelling. The committee has also recommended that changes to recyclability labelling should consider 'greenwashing' claims made on packaging and in advertising. This will reduce confusion and help consumers recycle the right containers and dispose of non-recyclable ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RED" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        cycle's collapse in 2022 highlighted the need for a sustainable approach for the collection of recycling soft plastics. While some local councils have launched soft plastic recycling trials, there is a clear need for an effective program that is harmonised across the country and led by the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's regional and remote coastal locations, and the communities that live there, are some of the most disproportionately affected by plastic pollution. Ocean currents can move plastic waste across vast distances, leading to pollution far from its point of origin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Limited resources and insufficient infrastructure mean that these communities cannot manage such enormous quantities of plastic pollution, including ghost nets, on their own. Due to a lack of any other options, the plastic waste that is collected by volunteer organisations is either sent to landfill or burnt. This further impacts the environment and public health. The committee has recommended more support for these communities through additional funding, recycling infrastructure and a preprocessing hub for ghost nets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Microplastics have the potential to harm humans. Microplastics and microfibres can already be found in our water and food and may carry harmful chemicals and toxins. Ingestion of these particles raises concern about the potential health risks such as inflammation and toxicity. However, knowledge in this space is currently limited and requires further investigation. The government should invest in research into the potential risks and effects of microplastic pollution, and any absorbed toxins on human health. The initial research should be made publicly available by July 2026.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has also recommended that a national plastics reduction strategy is developed to investigate and implement policies to stop microplastics from entering the marine environment through stormwater systems, particularly those located in busy suburban areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plastic pollution is a global issue. Global cooperation is needed to implement strategies to reduce plastic production and use; promote plastic reuse; and improve international recycling efforts. The committee welcomes the development of an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. The committee has recommended that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        are supported to participate in these discussions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I thank those who contributed their time and their expertise to this valuable inquiry. I also acknowledge the dedication of the members of the committee and the secretariat in the conduct of this inquiry. I commend the report to the House, and I move:
