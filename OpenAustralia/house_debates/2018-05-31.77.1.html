         <p>
          I thank the honourable member for his question. The government certainly sees as a top priority the effort to keep our borders secure, because if we keep our borders secure we can keep our country safe. The government inherited an enormous mess when it came to border protection. The fact is some 50,000 people came on 800 boats, and, tragically, 1,200 people drowned at sea. We were able to implement Operation Sovereign Borders and make a number of changes. We have seen a stop to those boats, even though the people smugglers are still there, probably waiting for a Labor government at some point into the future—they would believe, rightly, that they'd be back in business.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was a debate last weekend in Victoria and there was a proposal, given the civil war that's taking place on border protection within the Labor Party at the moment, for their policy to be debated at the conference in Victoria. But, as we now know, the debate never proceeded because the CFMMEU moved its block of votes in support of the Leader of the Opposition to close the debate down. So riven with division is the opposition they don't even want to air the for and against on border protection policy. Why is this unholy alliance continuing between the CFMMEU and the Leader of the Opposition? There is a long and sordid history when it comes to the CFMMEU and the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is personal friends with many within the CFMMEU. The fact is that millions and millions of dollars have been donated by the CFMMEU to the Labor Party, and we know now that over 70 CFMMEU officials have been charged with offences. It is the most lawless union in the country. I note again that this Leader of the Opposition refuses to rule out taking money from the CFMMEU. Whereas
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Hawke
          </a>
          disassociated himself with those unions that had gone rogue, this Leader of the Opposition clearly does not have the character. I noticed in

           The Minister will resume his seat. The member for Lindsay is warned. At this point I'm asking the Minister to resume his seat, because I just want to make it very clear to the House that I'm concerned we're about to get into territory that is sub judice.

          <p>
           I'm going to address the matter without the minister giving a running commentary, otherwise I'll solve the problem in another way, frankly. I'm entitled to address the House on what I consider to be an important matter. The minister may well find that, if he's looked at Practice, there are general principles with respect to the sub judice rule. One of those key principles is:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           As a general rule, matters before the criminal courts should not be referred to from the time a person is charged until a sentence, if any, has been announced; and the restrictions should again apply if an appeal is lodged and remain until the appeal is decided.
          </p>
          <p>
           What the minister has done so far is on the right side of the line; he's merely referring to a public fact. But I've taken the decision to sit him down to warn in advance that matters that could be sub judice need to be avoided, and I'm making that clear in advance.
          </p>

           That's a very good point, and the minister knows the rules on props.

                  The point that I go to is the fact that the CFMMEU are the most lawless union in the country, and yet they are best mates with this Leader of the Opposition. People of questionable character donate millions of dollars to the Labor Party, and this Leader of the Opposition doesn't have the strength of character to stand up to people of this ilk.
