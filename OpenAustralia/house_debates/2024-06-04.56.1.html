        <p>
         A couple of important points about that question. As I acknowledged in the answer a moment ago, we know that people are under pressure whether in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         or, indeed, right around Australia. Inflation was much higher when those opposite were in office, but it's still too high now. That's why our budget is so focused on making sure we are providing cost-of-living help to people.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the honourable member was serious about these cost-of-living pressures, she would enthusiastically support our efforts to give a tax cut to every taxpayer in her community and right around Australia. If she was serious about these cost-of-living pressures she would enthusiastically support our energy bill relief for every household in her community and in our community, she would enthusiastically support an increase to the minimum wage, she would enthusiastically support our efforts to make medicines cheaper and she would enthusiastically support our efforts to cut student debt for students right around Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that people are doing it tough and we know that people are under the pump. That's why our budget was so focused on fighting inflation without smashing the economy. A key part of that—arguably the most important part of that—is cost-of-living relief right around the country, including in WA.
        </p>
        <p>
         It would be remiss of me, getting a question from WA—and following on from the Minister for Resources a moment ago to point out—to point out how substantial the support is for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         economy in the budget. Probably no budget—and certainly not one that I've been here for in the last couple of decades—has been more focused on the vast economic and industrial opportunities of the Western Australian people and workers and businesses and investors. It beggars belief from a party that pretends to support Western Australia that since we released the budget, with all of its focus on WA industries, those opposite couldn't find it within themselves to support WA.
