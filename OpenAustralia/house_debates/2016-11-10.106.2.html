        In the 240-year history of the American republic, no candidate has ever before been elected president without previous military, executive or legislative office. Elections determine power, not truth. It remains true today as it was yesterday that

        columnist, noted, summarising Trump's behaviour over four decades, 'I don't see what else to call it but racism.' These remain facts, and those who say that the people in Australia should refrain from stating these facts are effectively saying that when someone is powerful we should not call out sexism and racism where we have seen it. It was reasonable for those on the other side of the House to describe Mr Trump as 'terrifying' and 'kind of weird' and his comments on women 'loathsome'. And those who made these comments should not now refrain from them.

        What should progressives do on the day after a Trump victory? A temptation is to retreat, but it is vital to remember that reform is two steps forward, one step back. As the great American Martin Luther King once wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
       </p>

        The great American Martha Nussbaum wrote many of those who transformed their countries have drawn on the ethic of love including

        . As the great American Barack Obama once put it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … whenever we exaggerate or demonize, oversimplify or overstate our case, we lose. Whenever we dumb down the political debate, we lose.
       </p>
       <p>
        And an increased partisanship cannot be met by increased partisanship.
       </p>

        Today is the day in which many progressives are naturally sad and angry, wishing to pull the blanket over their heads and retreat from political life. But I urge progressives to remember the words of another great American progressive, United States senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker" rel="nofollow">
         Cory Booker
        </a>
        , who spoke about the politics of love at the recent
