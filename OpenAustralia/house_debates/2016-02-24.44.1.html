       <p>
        I rise in relation to an accident-prone black spot on the corner of the busy Woy Woy Road and Langford Drive in Kariong that has been the scene of at least 16 accidents in recent years. It is just metres away from a community centre, a childcare centre, tennis courts, homes and small businesses. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, I pledged to fight to get this intersection fixed. Together with some great local residents such as Peter Pauling, Fiona Lloyd and Yvonne Hart, we gathered a petition of around 3,000 signatures calling for action. The funding required by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford City Council
        </a>
        at the time was $675,000. I am proud to say that the coalition government delivered on this funding in the last two budgets.
       </p>
       <p>
        But as I stand here today, the intersection still has not been fixed and council has now advised that the cost has gone up to $1 million. Last night, we saw some vital progress from council with a motion moved by councillors
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ward" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Jeff Strickson and seconded by the deputy mayor, Councillor Craig Doyle, to ask what was happening. The outcome is that council will request that the

        government's Roads and Maritime Services commit with council to a fifty-fifty funding of the shortfall to help build a mid-block signalised pedestrian crossing. It is welcome news and I thank Gosford Council for their decision last night. But what we really need to see are shovels in the ground soon before another accident happens. I look forward to continuing to work with council and fight for our Kariong residents to ensure this urgent upgrade at the Langford Drive intersection is complete.
