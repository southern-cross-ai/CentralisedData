       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring in order to facilitate the work of the Federation Chamber in considering the appropriation bills:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) on Wednesday, 24 May the Federation Chamber to meet from 9.45 am to 1.30 pm and from 4 pm to 7.30 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) on Thursday, 25 May the Federation Chamber to meet from 9.45 am to 1.30 pm and adjourn without debate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) on Monday, 29 May the time scheduled for private members' business in the Federation Chamber to be allocated to government business;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) on Tuesday, 30 May the Federation Chamber to meet from 12.15 pm to 1.30 pm for government business in addition to its scheduled hours of meeting, and the period from 4 pm to 4.30 pm also to be allocated to government business;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) on Wednesday, 31 May the meeting of the Federation Chamber to continue until 1.15 pm and then suspend until 4 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) on Thursday, 1 June government business in the Federation Chamber to continue until 1 pm and an adjournment debate to take place from 1 pm to 1.30 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) on Tuesday, 13 June the period from 4 pm to 4.30 pm to be allocated to government business and there to be no Grievance Debate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) on Wednesday, 14 June the Federation Chamber to meet from 1 pm to 1.30 pm, in addition to its scheduled hours of meeting, with an adjournment debate to take place from 7 pm to 7.30 pm;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9) on Thursday, 15 June the meeting of the Federation Chamber to continue until 1.15 pm and to be adjourned without debate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (10) on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 20-22 June, Members' constituency statements to continue for 60 minutes, irrespective of divisions in the House;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (11) on Wednesday, 21 June the Federation Chamber to continue until 1.30 pm before suspending, and the time scheduled for government business from 11 am to be allocated to private members business until 6.30 pm, as determined by the Selection Committee, to be followed by a Grievance Debate until 7.30 pm; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (12) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the interest of members of parliament, this will allow the consideration in detail of the appropriation bills to occur in the Federation Chamber from one portfolio to another, as has been the case in previous years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
