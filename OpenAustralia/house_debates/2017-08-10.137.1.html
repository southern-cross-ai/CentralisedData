       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge and recommend a worthy program that recognises a very special, deserving person in my electorate of Hasluck in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . I hope all Australians were aware that last week was DonateLife Week. The very special person in my electorate I wish to acknowledge is Mr Norm Rudd of Bellevue, who recently underwent a heart transplant. I thank Norm for coming forward to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation as part of this year's DonateLife Week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm was born with a congenital heart defect known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot" rel="nofollow">
         Tetralogy of Fallot
        </a>
        , and has spent his life fighting heart problems. Early last year Norm underwent a life-saving transplant that gave him a new heart and a new lease of life. Norm made a decision to himself to be an organ donor, as he recognised that people don't always realise the impact organ and tissue donations have until you, or someone you know, need an organ. There are 267 living donors who last year donated a kidney or part of a liver and continue to lead a normal life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The message Norm wanted to get across was that we don't need our organs when we're gone; however, they may be able to be used by someone else. He also said that when we become an organ donor we take a raincheck and only use them when we have finished with them. Your donation can be used to make someone's life worth living. I encourage all of my Hasluck residents to sign up as organ donors through the new online registration process. Thanks to this new online registration process, it is now faster and easier than ever to register your donation decision on the Organ Donor Register. All you need to do is use your mobile phone, tablet or computer and visit donatelife.gov.au, or just type in 'donate life', where you can register in just minutes. A minute of your time can save and improve the lives of 10 or more people needing an organ and improve the lives up 70 people through tissue donation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As minister responsible for the Organ and Tissue Authority, I am very passionate about urging all Australians to jump online today and register their donation decision. Some of the key reasons people give for not registering is that they don't have enough time to register or they haven't got around to it yet. The aim of the new online registration is to address these barriers and assist people in registering their decision to save lives in a fast and secure manner. Last year, a record 1,713 Australians received a transplant thanks to the generosity of 503 deceased and 267 living organ donors and their families. However, with 1,400 Australians still currently on waiting lists and a further 12,000 people on dialysis, I would ask all Australians to consider becoming an organ donor. Registering is easy, but the other important step I encourage you to take is to talk to you family to let them know what your wishes are, because when they know your wishes they are more likely to honour your wishes.
