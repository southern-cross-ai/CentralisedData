        Recently I had the pleasure of attending the third annual Celebrate Henley Community and Family Fun Day, which was held in my electorate of Hindmarsh at the Henley and Grange Memorial Oval,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The Celebrate Henley Community and Family Fun Day is all about building the community, getting the community together and building community spirit. It is about getting active and getting involved while at the same time having fun and finding out what is new in the local area. This year it was held on Sunday, 10 April and it involved more than 20 local organisations from Adelaide's western suburbs, from schools, sporting clubs and the wider community. There were many different activities and events for people of all ages including food, kids' entertainment and art displays, sporting demonstrations, gardening, workshops and even a mobile library and presentations on sustainable living. These were delivered by the local community school and sporting groups who took part. These included the Henley and Grange Football Club, the Henley Surf Life Saving Club, Henley Districts Little Athletics, the Henley and Grange Art Society, the Western Districts Athletics Club, the Henley Sailing Club, the Adelaide West Girls Brigade, Transition Adelaide West, the Henley Community Garden, the Henley South Tennis Club, the

        .

        The weather was a little bit on the cold side and there was a bit of rain but that did not spoil the fun that everyone had. It was a wonderful day for all those involved. I also had the pleasure of seeing the fantastic new solar power system that was installed on the roof of the Henley and Grange Football Club rooms and which was funded in part by the federal government. The new system has 32 solar panels and can generate up to 7.5 kilowatts of electricity and for each year that the system operates 17 tonnes of carbon dioxide will be saved, which is equivalent to taking six cars off the road.

        I offer my congratulations on this wonderful achievement and my congratulations to the whole Henley and Grange community for a very enjoyable and inclusive community fun day. I have to mention and congratulate Dos O'Sullivan, who is the President of the Henley and Grange Football Club; Neville Fielder, the President of the Henley Surf Life Saving Club; and Peter Gangar, the President of Henley Districts Little Athletics. They are the founders who put this together and ensured that it was a successful day. They are wonderful people that bring the community together. Days like this assist and help in building community relations and ensuring that the community gets together to build that community spirit which is so important in all our neighbourhoods in all our electorates. I think we need to see more days like this when different clubs get together and inform each other of what they are doing while at the same time members of the community have a lot of fun and enjoy themselves.
