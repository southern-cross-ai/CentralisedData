        The Abedians' contribution to Moncrieff and the wider Gold Coast community is to be commended. Through the Abedian Foundation and its scholarships for 80 students per year coming into Gold Coast universities, including my own alma mater—

        Soheil Abedian is a good man. He's a gracious man. He's a great man. He's a man of faith—the Baha'i faith—a man of courage, a man of great principles, a man of determination and a man of compassion. I congratulate him, his wife, Anne, his children, Sahba, Mona and Tom, and his nephew, Khian, for the great honour that the home of the entrepreneurial spirit has bestowed upon Soheil Abedian AM.
