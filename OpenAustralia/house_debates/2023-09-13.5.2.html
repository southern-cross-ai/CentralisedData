       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia's energy grid is under imminent threat of blackouts as soon as this summer, as the Government's energy plan drives the premature closure of baseload energy without any guarantee of like-for-like replacement;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) that the stark warning is a direct result of the Government's energy policies;

        and Energy repeatedly claiming that he is leading an economic transformation 'bigger than the Industrial Revolution' his Government has not asked his department or Treasury to complete any modelling of the energy plan;

       <p class="italic">
        (h) that increased demand for gas coupled with decreased investment due to the Government's anti-gas policies will exacerbate the threat to reliability and the risk that the lights will go out;

        (k) the Government is setting up renewable energy for failure, not success, by demanding a renewables-only grid; and

        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately stop its ideological crusade against energy technologies it does not like despite many of these technologies having reliably kept the lights on for decades;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) adopt an 'all of the above' approach to energy, as the Opposition has done, to ensure a balanced mix of technologies that can power our grid into the future, including renewables but not only renewables;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) support any state government that seeks to avoid premature closure of coal fired power stations while like-for-like energy generating replacements are built; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) reinstate a technology-agnostic capacity mechanism as an insurance method to provide operators with the incentives they need to ensure a reliable synchronous energy supply in the grid.
