       <p>
        I think we can all agree on one thing: 2021 has been a very challenging year indeed—challenging not just because the world has had to navigate the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic but also because the flow-on effects to our local communities have been profound and in some cases devastating.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been heartened in Higgins by the enormous outpouring of support from our local community volunteer organisations. These groups have weathered the pandemic storm and been a beacon of light, supporting some of our most vulnerable in their darkest of times, and today I want to acknowledge them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year I have the privilege of hosting the Higgins community volunteer awards to recognise the outstanding efforts of the local unsung heroes of the Higgins electorate—the men and women of our local sporting clubs, Rotarians, scout groups, churches, toy libraries and the many other local clubs who make our community great.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year 30 individuals were recipients of the prestigious community volunteer awards and were acknowledged for their efforts by their peers at the award ceremony in November. The story of these community leaders touched my heart, and I want to thank all of those who submitted nominations this year. Collectively, our recipients contributed over 260 years of service to their local organisations, which speaks volumes to their ongoing commitment to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also place on record my sincere thanks to our extra special guest speaker, none other than three-time Olympic athlete, including the recent

        , and bronze medallist at the Olympics, Anabelle Smith—who also happens to be a Higgins constituent. Anabelle shared with the volunteers her experience competing as a triple Olympian and her admiration for volunteerism in her sport. As an athlete, passionate sportswoman and local champion, Anabelle has spent her career surrounded by dedicated volunteers who've made an enormous contribution to her success. I want to thank her for joining us on the evening and for being so inspirational.

        The Morrison government will always support our hardworking volunteers, and it gave me great pleasure this week to notify 37 community groups across Higgins that they were recipients of federal funding for volunteer grants. A total of $130,945 will be shared across these groups in a huge boost that will mean they can continue to play their crucial role in society, especially as we move forward out of the pandemic. Volunteering helps to reduce marginalisation. It increases community participation. Importantly, but often not recognised, it provides many with a proven pathway to work. Well done to all our volunteers across Higgins. I look forward to celebrating with each of these recipients in person very soon, as we'll be hosting a morning tea, now that Melbourne is out of lockdown, early next year. I look forward to meeting all of them and saying congratulations in person.
