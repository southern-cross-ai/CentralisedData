        Today I want to celebrate the achievements of one very special
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        local, June Smith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . June was recently awarded Citizen of the Year by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">
         George Town Council
        </a>
        for her service to the local community since arriving in George Town 55 years ago. June's achievements are numerous and worthy of recognition here today. June was a founding member of the local Play Centre in 1971 and was eventually elected as its president. She was an active member of the parents and friends association of local schools for a number of years, introducing critical healthy eating programs. In 1975 June was elected as a George Town councillor, staying on until 1984, and during this time she served three years as deputy wardenâ€”the first woman to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        June also served as a representative on numerous childcare, welfare, school, women's and senior citizens committees and was on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">
         YMCA
        </a>
        board of management for five years, organising school holiday activities, projects for the unemployed and camps for disadvantaged children. She became community officer at George Town in 1987, securing government funding for a community car service, family support worker, social worker, food and nutrition worker, office traineeships and youth employment schemes. June also instigated the George Town Winter Appeal, involving all church and community groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not content to go quietly into retirement, after leaving the council in 1995 June went on to establish the George Town Choral Group, which performed and entertained residents of Ainslie House aged-care facility. June volunteered for six years at Ainslie House, organising games afternoons for residents. Again deciding that she still had more to give, June ran again for councillor, serving from 1999 to 2002. June has rightly been recognised with numerous awards over the years for her tireless dedication to our local community, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        and a place on the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to share some of my personal thoughts about June, who I first met when I moved to George Town in 2008. I would describe her as a force of nature and a trailblazer. She's ahead of her time when you look at her achievements. June has never been backwards in coming forward and doesn't take no for an answer. She is the very definition of a doer. It's thanks to people like June that women like me have had the opportunities that we have enjoyed since, and I hold her up as an example of what's possible. I'd also say that I wouldn't want to be on the prickly end of her pineapple, and I'm fortunate that I don't think I have been yet!
       </p>
       <p>
        June, you've enriched the lives of so many through your dedication to community service, and I don't think we could even begin to count the number of people you've helped in your 55 years of involvement with the George Town community. You are the epitome of what true service to others looks like, and being awarded Citizen of the Year is another worthy accolade.
