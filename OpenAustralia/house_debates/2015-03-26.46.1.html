        I rise to share with the House the coalition government's commitment to support Australians with disability. I was pleased to see the announcement made by the Assistant Minister for

        coalition government will commit $14.7 million in 2015-16 for the NDIS in Western Sydney and the Baird government will commit $8.7 million. People with disability, their supporters and families should be encouraged that the scheme is proceeding so well in New South Wales. This is a reason to vote for the coalition on Saturday.

        The coalition government is committed to rolling out the NDIS in full, and I am pleased that people with disability and their carers and families across these three areas will benefit from the NDIS before the year's end. Both the Baird and the federal coalition governments areâ€”
