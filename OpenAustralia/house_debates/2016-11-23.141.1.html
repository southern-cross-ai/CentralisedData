        As we move into summer, as temperatures rise and the school holiday start, Australians will be following a long-time tradition in flocking to the water—pools, the beach, creeks, rivers and dams all around our continent. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the awareness of Brisbane families, and all families around Australia, of the importance of water safety. Australia, sadly, has some of the worst drowning statistics of any country around the world. It should not surprise anybody to know that the drownings are most likely to occur over the summer period. In the 12 months to 30 June this year, Australia recorded about 280 drownings—in other words, about one day—and 66 of those fatalities unfortunately were in Queensland. Far too many of those who drowned were kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken previously in this chamber about the great work of Kidsafe Queensland in their work to raise awareness around kids safety and reducing accidents around the home. I want to commend all parents who are taking steps to ensure their children learn to swim. Last week I was able to visit a local business in Brisbane teaching swimming and water safety to children from the earliest ages. I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Holland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and his very energetic and passionate team at the Aquatic Achievers swim school based in Paddington, who are doing great work preparing our kids—and their parents—for the pool, beach and creeks this summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        In encouraging all parents to consider talking to their kids about water safety, taking them to swim schools and enjoying the summer safely, I would also highlight some other benefits of swimming in terms of giving kids a chance to be more active and fit. The recent Active Healthy Kids Australia report card gave Australian kids a D minus for overall physical activity levels. National data indicates that only about one in five Aussie kids is meeting the daily physical activity guidelines, which recommend about 60 minutes a day of physical activity. I hope we can inspire more families to take advantage of their local swim schools for the fitness benefits and also because every drowning that occurs is one too many.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note that earlier this year the Turnbull government, in conjunction with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Water_Safety_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Water Safety Council
        </a>
        , launched the Australian Water Safety Strategy 2016-2020. The strategy outlines priority areas where various water safety bodies, governments at different levels and other interested stakeholders can work together to prevent drownings. It aims to reduce fatal drownings by 50 per cent by the year 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I would like to commend the work of the team at the Aquatic Achievers swim school in Paddington. I would like to give a shout-out to the Queensland surf lifesavers; to Kidsafe and the many other water safety bodies doing great work around Australia; and to the Hon.

        , the Minister for Health and Aged Care and Minister for Sport, for her role in launching the Australian Water Safety Strategy. Most of all, I would like to dedicate this speech to the parents helping their kids to learn to swim. I urge all families, when taking to the water this summer, to be safe.
