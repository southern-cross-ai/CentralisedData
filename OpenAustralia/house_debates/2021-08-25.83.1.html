        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer to the report in The
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        that the Morrison-Joyce government told
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSL" rel="nofollow">
         CSL
        </a>
        it would support mRNA manufacturing provided it meets the '

        test'â€”anywhere but Victoria. Is the report true?

         The short answer is: it's not, and obviously I was as concerned as the member was when I read that article. Now, whether or not such a claim was made by any person to the journalist, I obviously can't say or verify, but my office and the department went to some lengths to speak directly with those people at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSL" rel="nofollow">
          CSL
         </a>
         who would be in knowledge of any such statement, if it were ever made, because it is a matter of some seriousness if a Commonwealth official were to say such a thing, which they would never do and which we would never expect them to do; that would be a totally improper and wrong thing to do. So what I can say to the member is that that report, about Commonwealth officials advising CSL that the government had an '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABV" rel="nofollow">
          ABV
         </a>
         ' test, is absolutely wrong. It has been verified directly, after specific inquiries by my office, to my office that it's wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we are doing, with respect to our approach to market, is looking at all of the options that are in Australia's long-term best interests, in terms of health care: for mRNA manufactured vaccines, potentially, here; for COVID booster vaccines; for other therapeutics; for export markets. CSL have had a brilliant and rich history in Australia in contributing and, indeed, are manufacturing vaccines in Australia as we speak, and they have done a marvellous job. They've put in an excellent proposal, if I might say so. It's being considered seriously, alongside all of the other proposals. So I'm very pleased to say to the member: whether that was ever said to the journalist I can't say, but that was never said by any Commonwealth official to anyone at CSL and nor would it ever be.
