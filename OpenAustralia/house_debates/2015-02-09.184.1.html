       <p>
        Last Saturday I attended Lowood Volunteer and Club Sign On Day, sponsored by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Somerset Regional Council
        </a>
        . This Saturday I will be in Esk doing the same thing. I did my mobile office last Saturday with Councillor Jim Madden, the new Labor member for Ipswich West. I want to pay tribute to Amy Stockwell, who is the community and volunteers coordinator at the Somerset Regional Council, for the great work she did to make sure that that particular event, which was located at Lowood State Primary School, took place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to what is going to happen in Esk and Kilcoy in the next few weeks. The great community groups of the Brisbane Valley—now known as the Somerset region—were at Lowood in numbers. I want to thank them for the work they do. I also want to thank Trax church, which is a Pentecostal church that gives out lots of wonderful food hampers to people in need, families and individuals, in the Lowood region. I thank the Wivenhoe Pony Club, who have a great relationship with the Ipswich Pony Club, which I am involved in with Allen Zahnow and am a great supporter of. I want to thank them for the work they do. There is a lot of interest in equine activities in the area, particularly equestrian. Seeing the young people learn those skills really encourages me, and it is also a great pastime for a lot of people. I want to thank the Fernvale Lions and the rural fire brigades for their participation in that event. I congratulate the Somerset Regional Council for the work they do.
