       <p>
        I wish to bring to the attention of the parliament the considerable achievements of a wonderful resident of my electorate, Mrs Maureen Kingston AM. Maureen has been a tireless and dedicated worker in various capacities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        and in Brisbane previously. I have had the opportunity to work closely with her in her leadership positions on the Fisher Seniors Council, which I set up, and also the Fisher Australia Day Awards Committee. I have always found her to be determined, hardworking, friendly and supportive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her most noted achievement was her involvement in the Association of Independent Retirees, a wonderful organisation which represents retirees who have provided for their retirement during their working life. I am proud to say that this organisation, which has somewhere near 20,000 members in 80 branches across Australia, originated on the Sunshine Coast. Maureen Kingston was one of the foundation members and she helped to mould this organisation to become one of the most visible and effective champions of the needs of this sector of the community, to whom society at large owes so much. Maureen was its first national president, from 1992 to 1996, and national president again from 1998 to 2000, and its first honorary life member. Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello are among the many who have received regular correspondence from the Association of Independent Retirees. From annual budget submissions through to suggestions for improvements to capital gains tax guidelines and other issues, Maureen helped to create an Association of Independent Retirees that was not afraid to push its case with the government of the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maureen retired from the national presidency of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR" rel="nofollow">
         AIR
        </a>
        in October 2000, but not before having steered the organisation to one of strength and respectability that gives a considerable voice to the views and wishes of Australia’s independent retirees. On her retirement her contribution to the AIR and its members was honoured in a press release from the then Minister for Aged Care. Her efforts were recognised by the Treasurer who, during his keynote address for the AIR’s 10th anniversary, said:

        and other institutions as a tireless advocate, not only for the Association of Independent Retirees, but for older Australians and her community in general.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recognition she has received at the State and Federal level, including the

        attests to her compassion and community spirit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Maureen’s achievements serve as a reminder of how much can be done through constructive social partnerships between government and community organisations. They also serve as a valuable reminder of the active contributions many older Australians make to our communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can assure you that Maureen was an active, intelligent and persuasive advocate on your behalf as we went about designing the New Tax System.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maureen was someone who could walk through the doors of all senior ministers. She is greatly respected by people on both sides of politics. She has worked closely with me, as the member for Fisher, and she is a wonderful Australian, a person whom I greatly regard and a person I am very pleased to be able to recognise in the Australian parliament this afternoon.
