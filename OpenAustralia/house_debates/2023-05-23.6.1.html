       <p>
        I rise to speak on the additional appropriation bills for 2022-23. These bills—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 3) 2022-2023, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2022-23 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-23—provide for additional funds from consolidated revenue for the remainder of the 2022-23 year. Collectively, the additional appropriations bills 2022-23 appropriate approximately $6.2 billion from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        . The majority—approximately $5.5 billion—of this is to ensure that there is funding to cover upward revisions in demand-driven programs or other departmental funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opposition will be supporting the additional appropriation bills. However, this support should not be misconstrued as support for many of the ineffective or misguided policies of Labor's 2022-23 October budget. Labor's big-spending October budget was the canary in the coalmine for the big spending that would come in the form of Labor's May budget. In two budgets, in only a year in office, this Labor government has undertaken $185 billion of additional spending, while, at the same time, managing to cut infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        How are they trying to pay for this new spending? Well, with two new taxes on regional Australia that will add to inflationary pressures and increase the prices of groceries: a new food and fibre tax on farmers in the form of a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies; and a tax on truckies, with a 5.2c per litre increase in the heavy vehicle road user charge.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just a snapshot of the failures of this Labor government on managing the economy and managing the budget. I could go on for hours, but, with some reluctance, I will restrain myself from doing so.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opposition will be supporting these additional appropriation bills, but we will also continue to hold the government to account over the budget decisions it has made.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
