        Graziers just a half-hour drive from Rockhampton are facing a David-and-Goliath battle against conglomerate renewable energy companies that are planning to destroy acres of untouched land that is a habitat for koalas, sugar gliders and the rare

        . One development, the Moah wind farm project, has plans to cover over 10,000 hectares of remnant vegetation with wind turbines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glen Kelly and his family have been farming the land which backs on to under this project for six generations now. One of the turbines will be just 4.5 kilometres from their family home. Glen and his family understand the importance of farming to sustain and protect the land. They, and every other farmer in Queensland, adhere to the strict regulations enforced by the state government, which include tree-clearing guidelines, reef legislation and environmental protocols. Yet, unlike the farmers who are guardians of the environment they live and work on, these renewable energy companies don't have to meet any of these regulations. The sheer hypocrisy is astounding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister for the environment's need to hit his 82 per cent renewable target by 2032 is allowing these corporations to build their projects in completely inappropriate areas. The environmental damage that will be caused and the fact that the renewable companies do not have to meet any regulations, unlike other industries, is outrageous. The federal and state governments need to pause the push to rush to meet targets and take a step back to focus on the best way forward to make cheaper and cleaner power without the decimation of the environment.
