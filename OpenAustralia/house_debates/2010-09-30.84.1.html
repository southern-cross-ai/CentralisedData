       <p>
        On indulgence, Mr Speaker: obviously this is the last day parliament sits before commencement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        . While the focus has been on security and safety issues—I did have occasion to mention them in the parliament yesterday and I reiterate that Australians should pay regard to the travel advisory—perhaps today, as we leave this parliament before the start of the Commonwealth Games, we can move from safety and security, as important as it is, to wishing well the Australian athletes who are going to march into the stadium on Sunday to compete in the Commonwealth Games, proudly wearing their green and gold.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the biggest Australian contingent ever to attend the Commonwealth Games and each and every athlete who goes will have worked hard, trained hard and looked forward to this the most of their lives. They would have been supported by family and friends in what are remarkable endeavours of human endurance to make sure that they can compete on this world stage at this world class. I am sure that as our athletes march into that stadium every Australian will be feeling proud and will be wishing them well for the days of the Commonwealth Games.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the 19th Commonwealth Games and Australia is one of six countries—there are only six countries—which have competed in each and every Commonwealth Games. That is a record we would be rightly proud of. We are obviously looking forward to sporting success but whether our athletes come home with silver, gold or bronze, or they compete but are not up on the medal dais, I am sure we admire their efforts and we wish them well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously the Indian authorities, the Indian government and the Indian people have worked hard to deliver the Commonwealth Games. Seventy one nations will be in attendance and I am sure we would wish the Indian authorities, the Indian government and the Indian people well as they roll out the Commonwealth Games. I am sure that every member of this House would want to leave this place saying that they are hoping for a peaceful and successful games in India for our athletes, for competitors from around the Commonwealth and for the tourists and the people of India who are there at the games.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here in Australia, whether your sporting code is

        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        , it is a pretty big weekend. I would say to everybody who is competing, whichever side they are taking—obviously from the point of view of the AFL this has been a pretty interesting week—I am sure many Australians will be very enthused, very interested and very passionate about watching the contest on the weekend.

        <p>
         On indulgence: on behalf of the coalition I would like to associate myself with the remarks that the Prime Minister has made in respect of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Games
         </a>
         competitors. We congratulate them all and we wish them every success over the next fortnight. At the last Commonwealth Games, Australia had a record haul of 221 medals—let us hope they can do even better this time. Let us hope that these Commonwealth Games turn out to be memorable for all the right reasons. India is, of course, an emerging super power and may these games turn out to be a showcase for India’s economic progress, its democratic institutions and its cultural pluralism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like the Prime Minister, I wish all of the competitors in all of the great athletic and sporting contests that are happening this weekend very well, including
