        Earlier this month, hundreds a community members turned out to attend the memorial service of Mr Cosimo Brizzi, fondly known as 'Cos'. For more than four decades, Cos and his younger brother Ben trained generations of Darebin locals in the art of boxing, including

        champion, Ms Susie Ramadan. Starting out in a small tin shed behind the family home, by the late 1980s their group of students had grown too large and the Preston council helped them move to a decommissioned swimming complex in Kingsbury, which became the Brizzi Brothers Boxing Gym.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cos was known for his enthusiasm and commitment to the young people of Preston and Reservoir, helping them to develop their boxing skills and their self-confidence. After months of illness, Cos died of a stroke on 29 May. I was honoured to have known Cos as a much admired and dedicated member of our community. Our thoughts go out to his family, friends and the wider boxing community in this difficult time. He will be sadly missed.
