       <p>
        Today I am pleased to update the chamber with fantastic news for residents in the Bonner suburb of Tingalpa. I am proud to announce that the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        camera system at Minnippi Parklands is now fully operational. It is thanks to the hard work of local council and residents that these CCTV cameras have been installed. The cameras now record high-definition footage 24/7. The parklands are now safer for the many families and groups that use its facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to single out my colleague councillor for Doboy Ryan Murphy for much deserved praise. Ryan has been 100 per cent committed to delivering CCTV cameras to Minnippi Parklands since they were first proposed. He has done a first-rate job seeing this project through. When reports first emerged of inappropriate activities taking place at the parklands, Councillor Murphy was at the forefront of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        planning to make the area safer. He helped organise numerous infrastructure upgrades. Thanks to Ryan, lighting in the vicinity was improved, and, with other safety improvements that were made, Ryan then led key stakeholder meetings between council and Tingalpa Model Aero Club, which is the primary leaseholder on the site.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the club for their close cooperation with council and for providing the site for the CCTV tower to be installed. Councillor Murphy and club members attended every meeting on the CCTV proposal. They fully capitalised on the coalition government's $70,000 investment in the projectâ€”and, because of the tireless commitment to neighbourhood safety, residents will be able to enjoy Minnippi Parklands without fear of antisocial and criminal behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that round 2 of the Safer Streets Program is now open until 17 February. I encourage eligible groups and organisations in my electorate to go online and apply now. I look forward to delivering more funding for community safety initiatives in my electorate of Bonner.
