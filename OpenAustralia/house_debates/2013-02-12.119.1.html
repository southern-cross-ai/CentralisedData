       <p>
        Just over two weeks ago, I had the great privilege of delivering some very good news to about 2,000 Ipswich locals and the company which employs them—Ipswich's largest private employer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
         JBS
        </a>
        Australia. This is a good outcome also for local farmers who sell their beef to JBS Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with the federal Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Efficiency" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        , the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Combet
        </a>
        , I announced a $4.4 million federal government grant to JBS for its Dinmore abattoir facility and meat-processing plant. This announcement was opposed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        members from Queensland every step of the way. Why is this important to me personally? Because I started my working life as a cleaner at the JBS site. It was then known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMH" rel="nofollow">
         AMH
        </a>
        , and I worked as a cleaner on the kill floor.
       </p>
       <p>
        This grant is possible through the federal Labor government's $200 million Clean Technology Food and Foundry Investment Program. What will the grant do? By this grant, JBS will slash its electricity costs by $1.1 million every year by covering its settlement ponds, capturing the methane and generating electricity for its site. The amount of pollution produced per kilo of beef will be reduced by 81 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have had to endure some loud and very laughable protestations by the coalition in relation to carbon pricing, particularly in relation to the meat-processing sector. Who could ever forget Senator Joyce claiming that it would cost $575,000 to process one head of cattle in a meat-processing plant? Simply: what rubbish! The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency recently reminded us that none other than Senator Joyce also claimed that the introduction of a carbon price would lead to us all paying $100 for a leg of lamb. I have to confess that I did a fair bit of cooking over the Christmas break and cooked a lamb roast on more than one occasion. It did not cost me $100 at IGA; it cost me about $20 at IGA in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_View" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders View
        </a>
        , the suburb in which I live. In reality this $4.4 million grant from the federal Labor government shows that the federal Labor government is working closely with industry to make sure that we protect jobs, promote growth and do what we need to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berry" rel="nofollow">
         John Berry

        , the

        </a>
        and spokesperson for JBS Australia, for his tireless work. Together we trod the floors of Canberra, convincing the government that a $1 federal government commitment for a $3 private commitment should be reduced to a dollar-for-dollar commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank my electorate officer, Madonna Oliver. Madonna was with me in many of these meetings and worked closely with John.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a great outcome for local producers of cattle in the Ipswich and West Moreton region—particularly in the Somerset region. It is good for local jobs, it is great for growth and economic development, and sadly it is opposed by those opposite.
