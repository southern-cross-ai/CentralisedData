        I take my jacket off with some caution here. You'll have to bear with me to see where I'm going on this. Having been a farmer for 20 years, I found there is value in checking your arms. A couple of days ago I found myself with a little dot on my arm—a mole that was growing. Being sensible, my wife told me what to do. She said, 'You should get that checked out.' I got it checked out. I got it cut off only to find it was a melanoma.

        say to the farmers out there, to the country people and to Australians who love the sun: go and get checked out. Do yourself a favour before Christmas. It was very small. It didn't look much—two colours and a little bit sharp—but I have been told that the flat ones, the ones that don't look so sinister, are the ones you've got to watch out for. It seems to be a trend of the Nationals. Our leader,

        , who we're pleased to have back, has had some cut off. Maybe I've got leadership aspirations by also having a melanoma cut off my arm! Can I say: we love our sunshine and we love our summer, but do yourself a favour blokes and ladies and go and get checked out—particularly blokes, because we're notorious at not looking after our health. Luckily they got it in time. They've got to cut out a bit more in the next couple of weeks, when I get back from here. Ultimately, get a check-up, look after yourself and that will be the best present you can give yourself this Christmas.

         The member is excused for removing his jacket for such a serious message. I give the call to the member for Ballarat.
