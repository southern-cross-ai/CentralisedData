       <p>
        It's with a mild degree of distress that I report to the House that only in the past couple of minutes it's come to my attention that there has been an outbreak with at least one case of COVID-19 in the Goldstein electorate, from a man who recently travelled from Sydney to Sandringham, where he works; he lives in Oakleigh. This, of course, will cause enormous distress for the community, but it's also a time for people to rally and to make sure they take responsibility to protect themselves and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are a resident of Sandringham or the surrounding community and experience any symptoms related to COVID-19, you are able to go and get tested right now at Sandringham Hospital, just in the suburb. I heard from the mayor only moments ago that he walked past the hospital and there was virtually no queue, so, if you have the chance, please go and get tested to keep yourself, your family and your community safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to that, if you have the chance and opportunity to get vaccinated, do so. I have done so, as have many other members of the community. This is a decision about responsibility, not just to yourself to get vaccinated but for the health and wellbeing of the whole of the community. It will take time, but we've made it clear that by the end of this year anyone who wishes to get vaccinated will be able to do so, but you need to stand up and take responsibility to make sure we protect every Australian.
