       <p>
        There have been some exciting things going on in Donnybrook in my electorate. Congratulations to Oakway Estate, located in Palmdale, which recently won Best Cellar Door Experience for WA at the Travel and Hospitality 2023 Oceania Awards. Winners were selected based on the aggregation of reviews from multiple third-party sources. There were over 300 nominations received. The estate is being run by three generations of the Hammond family. The property originally supported apple and stone fruit orchards, before its potential for producing premium wines was realised. The current owners are Wayne and Ria Hammond. Today, the 100-acre, or 40-hectare, property supports the winery, a cellar door, a vineyard, a blue gum plantation and a small herd of beef cattle.
       </p>

        Also congratulations in Donnybrook go to Rowan, Merrin and the team at Donnybrook Pharmacy celebrating 10 years as part of that community. Their celebration included awarding one lucky customer a $200 gift card. There was also an amazing birthday cake and cupcakes. The team at the Donnybrook Pharmacy are now busy offering flu shots for their local community, as are most of our local pharmacies, to keep us all healthy over this period of winter. In a community that's based around farming and agriculture, known for its wonderful apples and pears, congratulations to each one of these worthy people.
