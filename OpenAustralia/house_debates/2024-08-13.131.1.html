        The Albanese government understands the transformative power of education. We want to make sure that all students, whether they are at primary school, high school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        or university, have every chance of success. In my electorate of Brand, the Albanese Labor government is making significant investments to support our local schools and school communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I grew up and went to school in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        and Rockingham Beach, so I know how important it is that local students get the best opportunities for a great education. Thanks to Labor, schools in Brand are now better equipped with the technology and infrastructure they need to deliver a quality education for students. Through the Commonwealth's Capital Grants Program, a total of $7.8 million worth of projects have been completed for new facilities in local schools in Brand. Schools such as the beautiful Mother Teresa Catholic College in Baldivis, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College" rel="nofollow">
         King's College
        </a>
        in Wellard and Rockingham Montessori School have benefited from this program. The new facilities include libraries, science labs, outdoor sports areas, food studios, an arts centre and specialist support rooms, and they will help generations of school students to come. Recognising the role of parents and communities in the education of young people, the Albanese government has so far provided more than $12,000 to P&amp;Cs in Brand through our Volunteer Grants program.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the school years, we want to make sure that students succeed well into the future. Access to quality vocational and higher education is essential to making sure that students are properly equipped with the skills for the jobs that they want and that the country needs them to do. Thanks to the Albanese government, students will be able to access courses for high-demand jobs for free as we deliver 300,000 fee-free TAFE places from this year. These fee-free TAFE places will change lives, especially in the electorate of Brand, and they will address skills shortages across a range of industries. That's especially the case in the suburbs of Rockingham and Kwinana, where the local community has the exciting opportunity to work in close support of the advanced technology of the AUKUS program, being conducted at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also, as a government, introducing payments for those doing mandatory practical placements next year. That means those studying teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work will be able to apply for payments of $320 a week while undertaking those mandatory placements. These payments will help students in Brand complete their courses and, ultimately, help employers get the skilled staff they need, which will be of benefit to the whole community. On top of this, more than 16,000 people in Brand will receive student debt relief, thanks to this Albanese government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm really proud of the work this government is doing to support young people and their education. These initiatives will help local students in our community to realise their full potential and to succeed.
