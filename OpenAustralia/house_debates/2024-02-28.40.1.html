        Another memorable milestone for the 47th parliamentâ€”the Albanese government's cost-of-living tax cuts passed yesterday. Everyone in Hasluck is now looking forward to 1 July, when those tax cuts will kick in, because everyone will now get a tax cut. These tax cuts are going to be appreciated by people particularly who are on modest wages, who were previously going to be missing out under the coalition. A full-time storeperson at Plantman Equipment in Bellevue on a $58,800 income will receive a tax cut of around $1,150. A warehouse supervisor at Ingham's Chicken in Hazelmere on $75,000 or $76,000 will receive a tax cut of around $1,600. A sales assistant at the WA farm shop in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Swan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on $50,000 will receive a tax cut of around $900. A retail assistant at Good Sammy in Ellenbrook on around $41,000 will receive a tax cut of nearly $700.
       </p>

        I often speak to people in the unions who are active in this space, particularly the

        , and I know there are those out there who are doing it tough. They will particularly notice and value these tax cuts because, unlike the coalition's old plans, these tax cuts are fair. Unlike the coalition, who want to make you work longer for less, under the Albanese Labor government we want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn. As a representative for Hasluck I'm glad we're delivering on that promise.
