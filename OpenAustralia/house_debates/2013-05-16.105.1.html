        My question is to the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. How do the government's workplace policies make Australian workplaces stronger, smarter and fairer? What other plans are there, and why is it important to be transparent about those plans?

         I thank the member for Reid for his question; I know his interest in fair workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget we heard on Tuesday night outlined our plans for fairer workplaces. We are investing in job-creating, productivity-building workplaces. We are making sure that we train our workforce of the future. We are making sure that we give a hand up for unemployed people to help them back into work. We are making sure that disabled people get a fair go all-round. We are tackling the scourge of asbestos and the scourge of workplace bullying.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor has plans—fair plans—for workplaces in Australia. We have a smarter, stronger, fairer approach to Australian workplaces, but there is a clear choice as the member for Reid alluded to in his question, because there is an alternative plan for Australia's workplaces. We saw the cat out of the bag last Thursday when the opposition proposed the sly, sneaky and stealthy reintroduction of unfair individual contracts. And on Monday we heard the retailers rub their hands in glee: if the Liberals get in, the good times roll on for

         . Then, on Tuesday the hoteliers had a crack. They said they would pop their champagne corks; they said, 'Fantastic, we can tackle penalty rates'.

          Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To be relevant, the minister really needs to point out that the individual flexibility arrangements were introduced by the Prime Minister, not by the Leader of the Opposition.

He said, 'Unfair individual contracts: let's bring them back'. He said, 'Let's go after parental leave'. The Chief Opposition Whip must have been channelling his inner Reith today! But he goes further: he says, 'Let's have crack at unfair dismissal protection'. They must love Peter Reith on the opposition side. They must say, 'Thank you for Peter Reith'.

             Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In order for the minister to be directly relevant, he must not just be tangentially relevant to the question, he must be directly relevant to it, and
