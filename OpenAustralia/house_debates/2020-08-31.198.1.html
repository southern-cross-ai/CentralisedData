        Sydney now boasts the most tolled roads in the world, and residents can soon expect three more toll roads. Once again, the

        </a>
        Liberal government is ignoring the needs of south-western Sydney electorates like Werriwa. The New South Wales government has levied a $6.95 toll on an existing road, all in order to prop up their budget blowouts, and there are delays on projects, like WestConnex and the Sydney light rail. There's no grace period and there's no cashback for this toll. Thousands of residents have signed my M5 East petition calling for this unfair toll to be scrapped. They've also contacted me directly. They've told me the increase of $3,300 a year to their family budget to pay for the toll is unsustainable, and that is taking into account the rebate they get for their registration. Especially during a recession, when family budgets are so stretched, to add insult to injury, the private operator gets an annual increase of four per cent. It's time the state government supported the residents of South-West Sydney and not expect them to pay for their mistakes, and it's time the local Liberal members of parliament speak up and say where they stand on this important issue. Their current silence on this is deafening, but they won't be able to duck and hide for cover from this one forever.
