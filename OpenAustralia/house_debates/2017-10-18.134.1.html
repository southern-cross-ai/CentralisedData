        On 17 September, I attended the Lugarno Lions club's 38th annual spring festival in Gannons Park at Peakhurst. As always, it was a fantastic day, with literally tens of thousands of people attending—they estimate around 40,000 people came on the day. Over the history of the event, more than $1 million has been raised for a range of great, charitable causes, many of them very local indeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day, there were over 150 stalls, which included stalls from a range of local businesses, live entertainment and various competitions. It was also good to see the Army,

         SES
        </a>
        , fire services and police represented at stalls on the day. I'd like to thank everyone at Lugarno Lions, one of the great

        and all of the scores of other members who were so actively involved in the day, congratulations, again, on a tremendous spring festival. We look forward to the 2018 edition.
       </p>

        On 13 October, I attended the second Georges River Light the Night event at Kelso Park and also at the Panania Diggers club in my electorate. It was fantastic event to raise funds for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        . Hundreds of people were there, holding lanterns to signify their support for people suffering from leukaemia and support for the critical research that will help to address the very serious issues of that disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank the community groups who were involved in the event: Panania Diggers, for its support; Padstow Rotary, who were there, as they always are, running the barbecue and doing a great job;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        nationwide Panania, a sponsor of many local events; and, in particular, Joanne Tonks, Katrina Larsen and all of the other organisers. It was only the second year of this event, but they raised over $21,000 this year and close to $50,000 in two years, which is a tremendous achievement. Well done to all involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 14 October, I attended the East Hills Bullettes Netball Club annual prize-giving night down at Picnic Point Bowling and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Social Club
        </a>
        . Thanks to Tara Banbury, the president, and Ben Seedsman, the club secretary, for inviting me along. The Bullettes have been around since 1999 and have 17 teams across both junior and senior competitions—about 150 players. They, of course, play at the big netball centre at

        as part of the Bankstown City Netball Association. It was great night with a fantastic atmosphere. It was great to see many of the young players recognised for their achievements during the year. Congratulations to everyone at East Hills Bullettes on a great 2017.
