        It's only a few days into spring, but yesterday's almost 30 degrees in my electorate of Macquarie was a taste of the bushfire danger that lies ahead, with the

        data mean we can see that conditions are similar to 2013, when more than 200 homes in the mountains, including mine, were lost. In my area, preparations for bushfire season pretty much never stop.

        In the Hawkesbury, the annual championships last month were a chance for friendly competition between the brigades. I was pleased to help present the prizes, with Tennyson winning overall for a second year running. Hawkesbury firefighters have also spent weeks doing hazard reductions and have treated more than 3,000 hectares. Nearly 400 people have been involved, and I especially want to mention 110 of them, who took time off paid work, for their efforts, and their employers, for their understanding.

        It's the same in the Blue Mountains. I recently attended the opening of the new Shipley brigade fire shed, a long fought-for addition to this upper mountains community. Captain Jim Crowther needs to be recognised for his absolute determination to see this shed rebuilt, as do all those involved in completing the wonderful project.

        district has also recognised 58 members for their long service, a staggering 1,357 years of service between them. These are people who will drop everything when bushfires strike, and we thank them.
