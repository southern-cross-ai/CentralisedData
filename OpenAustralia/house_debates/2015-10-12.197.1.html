       <p>
        I would like to present the attention of the house some great work being done by teaching professionals in my electorate. Recently, I met with local principals and senior staff from a number of schools, including Hastings Secondary College and Port Macquarie Public School. I heard all about their successful programs that they currently have underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Port Macquarie Public School, a program called the Little Dolphins has been initiated and is operating very successfully. Principal Brett Thurgate told me that nearly 100 families have already benefited. The Little Dolphins program aims to support children and their families in transitioning to kindergarten by valuing families as their child's first teachers. It also builds links between the home and the school. The program is seeking to promote development of literacy and numeracy skills in a fun and welcoming early learning environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Down the road at Westport Campus of Hastings Secondary College, significant inroads have also been made in using project based learning, utilising more practical initiatives that value-add to the more traditional teaching methods. I was pleased also to hear about their academy programs in the sporting, creative and

        </a>
        space.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hastings Secondary College has also introduced a Zenith program that delivers a solid pathway of support for gifted and talented students as well so that they can reach that goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank you, and congratulate Phil von Schoenberg, Amanda Leach,
