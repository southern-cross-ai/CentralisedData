       <p>
        It is with great sadness that I'd like to inform the House of the passing of one of Bayside's most influential businessmen, Mr Steven Economides. Steve was a larger-than-life character who would always greet you with his huge smile and handshake. A pioneer of the motor repair industry, Steve made his mark very early in life. When Steve was nine years old, he left his native Greece to settle in Brisbane. He was not one to ever shy away from hard work and help out his family financially. He sold newspapers, but it was the motor industry where Steve really made his mark. He operated one of the biggest motor repair shops in the country and was recently honoured at the Australasian Paint and Panel Successful Success Summit in Sydney.

        Steve's greatest success was his family. His wife, Jennifer, was his rock. Steve would often tell me how lucky he was to have her in his life. Devastatingly, Steve was diagnosed a few years ago with the insidious motor neurone disease. Despite being affected by this condition, it was impossible to keep Steve still. Steve remained active and, with the support of his family and many friends, was able to raise much-needed funds to fight

        and bring awareness to the Bayside community. His son, Paul, is making sure the business Steve started is continuously evolving, making it one of the best paint and panel shops in the country. Steve lived a full life surrounded by the love of his wife, Jennifer; his son, Paul; his daughters, Marie and Alicia; and his grandchildren.
