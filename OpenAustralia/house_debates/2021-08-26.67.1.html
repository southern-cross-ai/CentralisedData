        My question is to the Prime Minister. Last year the Prime Minister said Australians needed to come out from under the doona. Now he says to Queenslanders and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ns we need to come out of our caves. If the Prime Minister had done his job on quarantine and vaccines, half the country wouldn't be in lockdown. Why doesn't the Prime Minister stop ridiculing Queenslanders and Western Australians and accept responsibility for the health and economic crisis he helped to create?

         They either support the plan or they don't. They either do or they don't. And, if they don't support the plan, then at what rate of vaccination do they believe that Australia should open again? They either support it or they don't. Perhaps they're having an each-way bet on it. I don't know. But what I knowâ€”

           On direct relevance: there are many things that can be relevant to this question, but it doesn't ask about alternatives. It doesn't invite commentary on the opposition. It doesn't invite him to have some argument with an imaginary friend, as he's doing now.

            of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister certainly wasn't asked about alternatives, but when the question is framed with the preamble that it was I think the Prime Minister is entitled to respond to the accusations. I think he's entitled to do that, and I'm going to keep listening to the Prime Minister.

            <p>
             I was simply trying to make an explanation. To use an analogy from a children's animated movie which I've enjoyed with my children on many occasions, it's a pretty simple story, and it basically says this: that at some point, as a nation, all of us have to be clear that we have to move on and live with this virus. Like the young female character in that movieâ€”she decided that she wanted to go and face the future and go out there and deal with the challenges in the world, and she brought her whole family with her. And there was a sequel to that movie, and that says something. There's a lesson in thatâ€”that is, when you embrace these things, when you prepare for the future, when you move forward. That is the encouragement that I'm giving Australians. That is the plan that we've set out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those opposite might not share my view, but I know that our national plan will give Australians the hope and confidence that will not only lift vaccination ratesâ€”because we need to see those vaccination rates lift in Queensland and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia
             </a>
             . We certainly need to see that. I'm sure the member would agree with me on that. We need to target those communities that aren't getting vaccinations as quickly as we're seeing in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             and Tasmania and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
              ACT
             </a>
             and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
              Northern Territory
             </a>
             . And one of the reasons that the national plan is so importantâ€”and that we say to those who are getting vaccinatedâ€”is, when you get vaccinated, in phase B and phase C, you will have exemptions and you will be able to do things, as vaccinated persons, because you've taken the decision to ensure that you're less of a public health risk than others. The national plan, which I was explaining using that analogy, gives people that confidence. It gives them an incentive, which lifts vaccination rates and gets all Australians to where we want to be.
