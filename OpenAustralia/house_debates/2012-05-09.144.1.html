        The Australian Small Business Champion Awards, the only national awards that recognise the achievements of small businesses, were recently held in Sydney. The awards showcased some of the most outstanding small businesses from all around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the achievements of small businesses in the Penrith region shone brightly, with 60 local businesses being named as finalists and three going on to win their respective categories. I congratulate all of the finalists for being recognised at this national level of achievement: Kingswood Smash Repairs, Rejuven8 Penrith, Tax Today Penrith, Petrina Family Day Care Cranebrook, Connect Fitness Penrith, Advantage Psychology St Marys, James' Interior House Care Penrith, Go Bananas St Marys, White River Design Penrith, Property Central Penrith, Sittano's Bar and Restaurant Penrith, Stain Busters Penrith, Production Automotive Penrith, Complete Recruitment Solutions Penrith, Nepean Regional Security and Wild Ride Australia Colyton. With only 38 of these national awards on offer, it was a remarkable achievement for our region to have three successful businesses and 16 finalists.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the following award winners for 2012. Taking out the automotive services category was Production Automotive Penrith. Brendon and Melinda Leyshon, who have called Penrith home for many years, purchased the business in 2006 and have gone on to build an extremely successful business, which has been recognised by a number of state and local awards. I congratulate Brendon, Melinda and the whole team at Production Automotive for their success.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taking out the award for recruitment services and business growth was Complete Recruitment Solutions Penrith. Operating in Penrith since 2006 under the leadership of Linda Kemp, not only has Complete Recruitment Solutions proved to be a very successful business but it has also changed the lives of so many local residents by providing them with employment opportunities and pathways to careers. I congratulate Linda and the team at Complete Recruitment Solutions on their success and ongoing commitment to our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the category of services and business growth, Nepean Regional Security took the prize. Nepean Regional Security is operated by Gina Field, who is no stranger to winning awards, having won a number of local and state titles in recent years. I take this opportunity to congratulate Nepean Regional Security, Gina Field and her team.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am particularly proud of the fact that these three businesses not only are successful local businesses but are also actively committed to supporting our local community through sponsorship and charitable donations. Small businesses are the backbone of our local community and our national economy. I am extremely proud that small businesses from Penrith have achieved at such a great level and have shone brightly at these national awards.
