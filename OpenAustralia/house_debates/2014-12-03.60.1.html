        I rise today to note recent reports of sexual and physical violence taking place in institutions across the country against women with disabilities. Last week

        horrified Australians with stories of women who had been physically and sexually abused by those who had been entrusted to care for them. What is most concerning is that these stories do not appear to be unusual.
       </p>

       <p>
        Advocacy group Women with Disabilities Australia estimates that over 70 per cent of women with disabilities have been victims of violent sexual encounters. Pervasive and destructive abuse of this kind requires a serious response from government. That is why I welcome reports that the newly elected Andrews Labor government in Victoria will open an inquiry into Victoria's disability care system. However, all Australians who have suffered abuse of this kind deserve justice. As such, I also echo calls by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for disability reform to establish an independent investigation into these allegations.

        of People with Disability, I would like to acknowledge the important voices in my community who fight for the rights of those with disabilities by raising issues of this kind. One of those women in my community is Millie Parker. She is tireless in fighting for the interests of people with disabilities and making sure that their voices are heard. In the chamber today, I honour all her good work. I know that she will continue to be an effective advocate in my community—indeed, in all of our communities—into the future for people with disabilities.
