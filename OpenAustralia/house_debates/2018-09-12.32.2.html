        The distance between Canberra and Sydney is 286 kilometres and the distance between Canberra and Melbourne is almost three times that at 662 kilometres, so it's understandable to ask why on earth the price of a flight between Sydney and Canberra is up to four times higher than that of a flight between Sydney and Melbourne. A last-minute flight from Canberra to Sydney tomorrow will cost you $263 at best, with no luggage and no flexibility, but tomorrow you can get from Sydney to Melbourne for just $80—less than one-third of the price. This is absolutely outrageous.

        Earlier this month I received a letter from Canberran Monica Millgate, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are constantly shocked by the cost of airfares to and from Canberra in comparison to the rest of the country and wonder why this is happening. I work for a charity organisation and my partner is a motor mechanic, like many others in Canberra we are not high earners. The cost of airfares really puts my family at a disadvantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Monica is not alone. Since I started this campaign, countless Canberrans have told me about their expensive experiences, especially last-minute trips for funerals, so I wrote to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        s of Qantas and Virgin Australia asking them to please explain—'Please tell me why these airfares are so expensive.' The response was completely underwhelming.
       </p>
       <p>
        Qantas told me that $23.97 goes directly to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Canberra Airport
        </a>
        , which is by far the most expensive capital city airport in the country, according to them. Other than that, their advice was to book early. That was all of the advice. It failed to get to the nub of the question as to why so many Canberrans are paying $300-plus to fly from Canberra to Sydney. I wrote to them again because I was not satisfied with the answer. I asked for a breakdown of their fares. I'm happy to report that I'll be meeting with the Qantas government relations team this afternoon for an update. So, Canberrans, watch this space.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virgin Australia are yet to reply to my letter, so last week I wrote to them again asking for them to please explain. Once again, I'm yet to see a reply. On top of these outrageous prices, my community is still seeing flight cancellations almost double the national average. Just this week six flights have been cancelled and, as we speak, two flights are delayed at Canberra Airport. I feel sorry for anyone relying on getting to Sydney today. That's a regular story for Canberrans. This is simply unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, not all Canberrans are politicians. Contrary to popular belief, many of them are not on high incomes. I've started this campaign. I encourage all Canberrans to get in touch with me to share their experience. I'll continue to fight for my community for fair fares for Canberra.
