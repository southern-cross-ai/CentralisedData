        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister please update the House on how the Morrison government is providing critical ADF support to those communities impacted by flooding and stands ready to respond to further requests for assistance?

         Obviously the highest priority for the government at the moment is to make sure that Australians are safe from COVID and to make sure that those people who are suffering as a result of the floods at the moment are given every protection, not only now but in the recovery phase as well. The government is determined to work very closely with the emergency service personnel in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and in Queensland and, potentially, in Victoria as well. We want to make sure that every Commonwealth asset possible will be provided to support these Australians who, in many cases, have lost their homes, livestock, assets and the life that they knew only a week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         has one of the greatest capacities in the world to deal with threats offshore and domestically, but they also have an incredible skill base to provide support to Australians. As the minister earlier pointed out, the Australian Defence Force has now committed assets, both personnel and helicopters, that be will based out of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Base Richmond and also Nowra and Bega. It will be a 24-hour operation. They will provide support to protect the safety of life, which is the highest priority now. They will provide support to people as they evacuate. They will provide support to people in situations where they may seek to go into flooded crossings and river ways. They will provide support in the recovery phase as well. We want to help people get back to their normal life as quickly as possible but this is a very, very dramatic situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our plea again today to those Australians who want to wade into river crossings to rescue animals or to try and preserve their belongings, which is understandable, is: please do not do it. We've seen countless lives lost in our country over many years where people, with good intent, have gone into those waterways. The rapid nature of them means that you cannot compete: whether you're in a four-wheel drive, a tractor or a motor vehicle, it is just not a fair competition. Listen to the advice of the police and emergency services authorities, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland at the moment. Don't enter those waterways. Australians will see, once again, the familiar uniform of the Australian Defence Force going to the assistance of Australians in need. We will do whatever it takes to provide assistance to those Australians now and through the recovery phase.
