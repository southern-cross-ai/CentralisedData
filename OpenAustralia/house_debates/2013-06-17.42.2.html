        Several weeks ago I joined the volunteers and attendees at the Epping
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Granny Smith Day Club to help celebrate 30 years of operation. The Epping RSL day club has been open since April 1983 thanks to the dedicated support of a large number of volunteers. Every Friday the volunteers put on a morning of activities for the elderly and isolated at the Chester Street Epping Uniting Church. Essentially it is a social club designed for people who are unable to participate in social activities already established in the community and it generates personal friendships between people who are isolated.
       </p>
       <p>
        A free bus service takes people to and from the venue each and every week. I have visited the Granny Smith Day Club on several occasions and I can attest to the wonderful work that they are doing to provide a warm and inviting environment. I have been told by many of the regulars how much they look forward to Fridays at the Epping RSL Granny Smith Day Club. President John Curdie, Margaret Waddell and John Roddy along with their team of volunteers continue to provide a vibrant program each week of mental stimulation and gentle physical exercise. The program is full of variety and I thank the volunteers for going to so much effort in preparing a diverse array of activities. The volunteers give significantly of their time and energy and, without their efforts, the Granny Smith Day Club would not be the success that it is. I offer them every good wish and hope that the program continues well into the future.
