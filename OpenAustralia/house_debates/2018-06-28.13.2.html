        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        more broadly. This project aligns with the
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        's advice on the importance of key enabling capabilities at defence bases. The paper foreshadowed the upgrading of
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        to support the new offshore patrol vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants and contractors, a maximum workforce of 240 personnel and an average construction workforce of around 130 personnel. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $272.6 million, excluding

        . The committee has conducted an inquiry and considers the project to be value for money for the Commonwealth, fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to start in early 2019 and be completed by mid-2023. I commend the motion to the House.

        redevelopment project, Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        As advised when this project was referred to the public works committee on 28 March this year, the Department of Defence is proposing to redevelop the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct in Darwin, which encompasses HMAS
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        and the Larrakeyah Barracks. The redevelopment includes upgrades to engineering services, base entrance and working accommodation. The
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        recognises the importance of key defence base capabilities and foreshadowed the upgrading of Larrakeyah Barracks and
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        to support more offshore patrol vessels and Australian Defence Force operations and exercises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants and contractors, a maximum workforce of 290 personnel and an average construction workforce of around 130 personnel. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $223 million, excluding GST. The committee has conducted an inquiry and considers the project to be value for money for the Commonwealth, fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in September 2018 and be completed by June 2023. I commend the motion to the House.

         Garden Island
        </a>
        (East) Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        As advised when this project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 28 March this year, the Department of Defence is proposing to undertake repairs, installation and replacement works to wharves and engineering services at Garden Island in Sydney. The
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        identified the importance of Defence's key enabling capabilities, including wharves, and foreshadowed the upgrading of Garden Island to support an expanded fleet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The capital investment in infrastructure at Garden Island will bring economic benefits to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        economy, with employment opportunities in the building, construction and labour markets. The works will also provide opportunities for suppliers of construction materials and equipment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $286.5 million, excluding GST. The committee has conducted an inquiry and considers the project to be value for money for the Commonwealth, fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government I thank the committee for undertaking the timely inquiry into this matter. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled from late 2018 through to late 2023. I commend the motion to the House.
