       <p>
        I rise today in the House to praise the government and, in particular, the Attorney-General and the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for supporting the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ratifying this convention is a very progressive and far-sighted decision by the Rudd Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we all know, in every electorate across the country there are a number of people with disabilities who are able and willing to participate fully in society to contribute, whatever the skills and experience they have gained, to improving the broader community. Unfortunately, because of levels of discrimination, levels of prejudice and levels of concern, there are still some barriers to people with disabilities participating in our community as fully as they would like. I know there are many organisations across the community trying to protect and promote the rights of people with disabilities. Indeed, in my electorate of Bonner there are many such organisations trying to improve the rights of people with disabilities and to ensure that we end discrimination and provide equal opportunity so that they can continue to involve themselves in community life and to live a full and satisfying life for themselves and for their families. There are a number of these organisations, whether they deal with mental health issues, deal with physical disabilities, support parents caring for children with disabilities or support carers looking after people with physical and mental disabilities. There are a number of people out there—not just those with disabilities but those that support them—that I know are very pleased and proud that the government has made the decision to sign this convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am so pleased that the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, in conjunction with the treaties committee, have in a sense fast-tracked the ratification of this convention, because it enables the government and Australia to be part of promoting and making decisions, in the committee that will be involved, on the rights of people with disabilities. It will ensure that the government can participate fully in ensuring that this convention results in practical decisions and government policies on the ground that will end discrimination for people with disabilities.
