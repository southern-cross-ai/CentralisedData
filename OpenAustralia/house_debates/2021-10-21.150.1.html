       <p>
        I was walking in my electorate of Chisholm the other day, an electorate lucky enough to have two world-class universities:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Deakin University
        </a>
        . The students in my electorate were in high spirits, with their bars opening and their exams finishing. However, there was something missingâ€”a part of the student community that we have been missing. We are missing the international students that are such a vital part of our university community. International students improve the uni experience for our students. They give Australian students an opportunity to work with, learn with and interact with people from all around the world. We know that the international student community contributes so much to the education sector and we also know that they do more than that. It is international students that keep the cafes, bars, restaurants and student accommodation around universities alive, not only by supporting the hospitality industry but, very often, by making up their staff as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most international students have made the difficult decision to leave their friends and family to come alone and study here in Australia. I know it can be tough, because I was one of those who came as an international student. These students have put their faith in our country and our government, and we must support them. The Liberal Morrison government is working very hard to get international students back here safely, in an orderly way, as soon as possible. I would especially like to thank the federal education minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Tudge" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Tudge
        </a>
        , for leading this important work. Minister Tudge has been working tirelessly to put the building blocks in place to ensure a smooth return for our international students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government is paving the way for these students to come from countries which may have different kinds of vaccines. Through very careful research and investigation, we are recognising vaccines such as Sinovac and Covishield, which have received TGA approval. So I want to assure international students and the communities that rely on them, that I am fighting each and every day to make sure that you can return to study in Australia as soon as possible.
