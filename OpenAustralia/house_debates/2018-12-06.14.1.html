        I rise to speak briefly to these amendments. I thank the parliamentary joint committee for accelerating their comprehensive review of the bill. The government's response to the committee's review is extensive and the amendments address the committee's recommendations. The amendments include several very important amendments which have been the product of the parliamentary joint committee's consideration: a double authorisation mechanism requiring the Minister for Communications, as well as the Attorney-General, to approve a technical capability notice; a definition of systemic weakness and systemic vulnerability, and an extension of those definitions to technical assistance requests; a clear provision to acknowledge how the proposed measures interact with parliamentary privilege; a deconfliction mechanism for the use of technical assistance notices to ensure that issuance of notices by Commonwealth, state and territory agencies is consistent and proportionate; extending consultation requirements to technical assistance notices issued by interception agencies; limiting compulsory industry assistance measures to serious offences, notably those with a maximum period of imprisonment of three years or more; the imposing of time limits of 12 months for technical assistance notices and technical capability notices; the extending of consultation requirements to technical assistance notices; and the introduction of a new definition of interception agency to remove the ability of state and territory independent commissions against corruption to utilise the industry assistance measures in the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        To reflect recommendation 11 of the parliamentary joint committee's report, a robust framework has been established to enhance the independent assessment of technical capability notices. Upon referral from the provider, the Attorney-General will appoint a technical and legal expert to determine if a proposed capability will create a systemic weakness. These experts will also have carriage as to assessing whether the requirements imposed by the notice are reasonable and proportionate, whether compliance with the notice is practicable and technically feasible, and whether the notice is the least intrusive measure that would be effective in achieving the legitimate objective of the notice.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also provide robust review mechanisms—namely, review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor within 18 months of commencement and the expansion of an existing review by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        in early 2019—to encompass these measures. Existing oversight functions of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman have been enhanced to reflect their extensive comments provided during the committee's review of the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments, therefore, increase transparency and strengthen the existing accountability and oversight measures. They ensure that the powers in the bill are only used when required to facilitate our law enforcement and national security agencies' legitimate and lawful operations. I have tabled an associated explanatory memorandum to provide further detail on these amendments, and the agreed amendments provide further assurances to the parliament and to the broader community that the bill strikes the appropriate and necessary balance between maintaining privacy and security and ensuring agencies have the powers they require to protect our nation's security. I, therefore, commend the amendments to the House.

        <p>
         Labor will be responding to the amendments in two ways. The shadow Attorney-General will follow me and will talk about the detail of the amendments. I will explain to the House the reason why we're taking the approach that we're taking right now. We had been given in writing a guarantee from the Attorney-General, which I will quote from now: 'As discussed with you in our meeting earlier today, the government also commits to introducing the agreed amendments in the Senate, subject to the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives without amendment.' We had presumed that that would be the process that would be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reason why we viewed that as the wisest process in terms of national security is simple: whenever the intelligence committee has come forward with recommendations for amendment, those amendments have been provided to the opposition and, on each occasion, as I understand it, the opposition have come back saying, 'Some of these amendments don't actually fully reflect the recommendations within the committee.' When that has happened, the government, in good faith, has revised the amendments and we have ended up with amendments that properly reflect the committee's report.
        </p>
        <p>
         These amendments were provided to the opposition at 6.30 this morning. They were circulated online at 9.22 this morning. There are 173 of them. In the time that the opposition have had to go through them, we see that there are areas where the amendments that are currently in front of us do not yet properly reflect the findings of the intelligence committee. We believe it would have been the wisest path for the government to keep with their original agreement, but they have chosen not to. Notwithstanding that, the amendments that are in front of us get us closer to the committee's report than the original bill. With that in mind, Labor will be supporting the amendments that are before us. But, given that there are now comments following a particularly enthusiastic media conference from the Prime Minister, the government should recognise that there is a plan, potentially, to shut down the House today. I want to advise the parliament that that would not be wise.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will be seeking in the Senate to pursue further amendments to make sure that this bill properly reflects the findings of the intelligence committee. We would have preferred to have done that correctly the first time, but the government has chosen a path of particular haste. So we will support these amendments now, we will support a third reading of the bill and we will continue to pursue further amendments in the Senate, which will then come back to the House for this bill to be finalised. The amendments we will be pursuing will be within the frame of what is recommended through the intelligence committee report, in the same way we did when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
          Malcolm Turnbull
         </a>
         was Prime Minister or, indeed, when the member for Warringah was Prime Minister. I would simply ask the government to act on national security with a similar level of responsibility as what has happened under their two previous prime ministers. The intelligence committee operates this way for a reason. Bipartisanship matters and getting amendments right on national security matters as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are not afraid of the parliament. We are not afraid of the parliament sitting. We're happy to stay here for as long as it takes today. We don't need to clock off early. Of all the issues to clock off early on, it would be extraordinary if the government chose to do that on national security. Therefore, given the limits around what the government have done in breaking their earlier agreement, we will support the amendments in front of us, send the bill across to the Senate and, in the Senate, seek to have amendments that properly reflect the intelligence committee's report.

         <p>
          Just to add to the comments of the Manager of Opposition Business, there has been extraordinary conduct by the government in relation to this inquiry. There has been extraordinary conduct in relation to an inadequate bill, despite a consensus report of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          I thank the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hastie" rel="nofollow">
           Andrew Hastie
          </a>
          , the member for Canning, who is here in the chamber with us. As the chair, he and the other government members of the committee, together with the Labor members, joined with us in a consensus report, like the 18 or so other consensus reports that have been made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security since the Abbott government was formed in 2013. Labor has cooperated with the government to ensure that bills on national security that are introduced into this parliament are, in fact, fit for purpose. More than 300 recommendations have been made on a consensus basis by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security since 2014, as I say, in respect of some 18 different pieces of legislation, 15 of them major. To that, we can now add the 17 recommendations that have been made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in respect of this bill, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018.
         </p>
         <p>
          The inquiry of the committee has already been shamefully interrupted and interfered with by this Prime Minister and by this Minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Home Affairs
          </a>
          . It should, as we have said in an additional comment to the committee's report, never occur again. At the end of the legislative process—when Labor has cooperated with the government and when Labor has cooperated with the government to ensure that the process of the committee has been accelerated in an extraordinary way—this, as members of the public listening and any members of this parliament should know, is a 175-page bill that amends, in five schedules, 10 other acts of parliament. It is a complex bill. It's a bill that introduces, for the first time in Australian law, a power for agencies and police to compulsively require innocent third parties to assist the police in their inquiries in the technology area. The compulsive powers are to be used against innocent third parties who have nothing to do with the subject of an investigation, and that alone should have warranted much, much more time being provided for consideration than the government has seen fit to do.
         </p>
         <p>
          To add insult to injury, late on Tuesday, at about 7 pm on Tuesday, having committed in the terms that the Manager of Opposition Business has already referred to, in a letter to me from the acting Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General, we were told: 'The government also commits to introducing the agreed amendments in the Senate, subject to the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives, without amendment.' We proceeded in good faith on that basis. We finalised the report of the committee yesterday. It was tabled at around 7.30 pm yesterday. It contained 17 recommendations. We awaited the government's response.
         </p>
         <p>
          There still hasn't been a formal response of the government, but the first response of the government was to send us on an informal basis, at 6.30 this morning, most—but not all—of the amendments that are now before the House. And it's significant. We now have 173 amendments, covering some 50 pages, which the Attorney-General and the whole of the government, including the Prime Minister—who's here in the chamber and should be ashamed of himself for the disgraceful way in which he has performed over this national security bill, brought to the parliament, not fit for purpose—

                  I will make a brief comment on some of the matters mentioned by the shadow Attorney-General in his addressing of the amendments. Yes, it is the case that I indicated in a letter that we were intending to move the amendments in the Senate. That was based on an agreement between the shadow Attorney-General and me—and I'll be very specific about this—that the parliamentary joint standing committee would report yesterday in a way that would allow us to move the bill through the House of Representatives yesterday. So, the undertaking to move the amendments in the Senate was based on the agreement that this bill would already be in the Senate now. Indeed, we agreed, if I recall correctly, that there would be a very small, limited number of speakers so that we would be able to facilitate this bill through the House yesterday, and that didn't happen; that agreement was breached. And last evening, in trying to extract the report from the joint committee, I corresponded with Senator Wong, who was dealing with this. I said to her that I really don't want a fracture on the parliamentary joint committee, that I'd spoken to Pyne—our affectionate term for the Leader of the House—and I said, 'How about the committee signs off on the unanimous report tonight, we table the report tonight, you have the report and the amendments and we proceed first thing tomorrow?' and the response was, 'We'll work towards that.' So, the idea that somehow we're in breach of an agreement is totally false. This is a procedural effort to cause problems in another area of national security by procedurally jeopardising a national security bill, and we will not let that stand.

                   Regrettably, in the very short time the opposition has been provided with these amendments and the parliament has been provided with these amendments—they were first circulated to the parliament at 9.22 this morning, barely three hours ago, and there are 173 amendments covering some 50 pages—the government's contribution to this has been for the Prime Minister to give an intemperate and, frankly, ridiculous press conference rather than focusing on the fact that, despite the consensus report made by the 11 members of the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
                    Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
                   </a>
                   , which recommended to the government that a large number of changes be made to the inadequate legislation brought to this place by the government, it's already apparent that the 173 amendments do not conform with the 17 recommendations of the intelligence committee in a number of important respects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will just take some examples, although I'm not going to take up time going through the whole of the ways in which the 173 amendments don't conform to the committee's recommendations. Take recommendation 11 alone. That's a recommendation which makes it very clear, in very substantial detail, that the assessment of a technical capability notice—this is right at the core of contentious schedule 1 of the legislation—by a former judge and a technical expert is to be binding on the Attorney-General, and that both of them must be satisfied of certain matters. By contrast, the government's amendments only require the assessors to 'consider' certain matters rather than 'be satisfied of them', and only require the Attorney-General to 'have regard' to the assessors report rather than 'be binding' on the Attorney-General. This is a sharp and clear example of the government's failure to consider the recommendations or fulfil the recommendations. It's consistent with the sloppy approach that this government has taken pretty much to every national security bill. I see one of its authors, the former minister assisting the Minister for

                     now—that meeting with Apple is a sufficient form of consultation. The reality of this is that the member for Hume and the government didn't meet with the thousands of Australian small- to medium-sized businesses who are going to be affected by this bill. They should be ashamed of themselves for that alone.

                    <p>
                     Committee recommendation 17 makes it very clear that the bill must be amended so that an agency cannot sidestep a warrant requirement by asking a provider to give voluntary technical assistance. That called for an amendment to the bill. The government's 173 amendments, covering 50 pages, regrettably ignore this recommendation of the committee entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We're also concerned with the government's proposed definition of 'systemic weakness' and proposed definition of 'systemic vulnerability'. This, of course, is at the core of the committee's consideration. It's at the core of public concern about this bill. The government brought a bill that didn't even attempt to define 'systemic weakness' or 'systemic vulnerability'. What they've now done, in response to the committee's recommendation, is to include—as recommended—a definition of these two terms, but they're now using a definition that nobody can understand. They've used the term 'whole class of technology'. What does that mean? No ordinary person could understand it and no lawyer could understand it. Is new technology a class? Is old technology a class? We proposed a workable alternative to the government yesterday afternoon. Regrettably, the government hasn't responded, so we'll be moving amendments in the Senate—if this bill passes the Senate with these amendments—in order to ensure that the bill is fit for purpose and not the inadequate piece of legislation the government brought here.
