       <p>
        Bowel cancer is on the rise and is Australia's second-deadliest cancer. Sadly, it claimed my father. It claims the lives of more than 5,350 Australians each and every year. Whilst the risk of bowel cancer increases significantly with age, it does not discriminate, and, indeed, we're seeing it in younger people all the time. In fact, it is considered the deadliest cancer for Australians aged 25 to 44.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of having a meeting with a young woman in my electorate, a constituent, who was diagnosed with early onset bowel cancer at just 28 years of age. She was remarkable, she was brave, and she shared her lived experience with me about her early onset bowel cancer and the incredible work that she is now doing to raise awareness, especially amongst younger Australians. This superfit and healthy youth worker knew something was wrong, but it took her six trips to emergency before she started the journey to a diagnosis. I heard how young Australians with bowel cancer symptoms find themselves needing to battle the age bias when it comes to getting a diagnosis. Given it's one of the most treatable forms of cancer when detected early, her work in raising awareness amongst younger Australians is particularly important. Youthfulness should not be a barrier to getting a timely diagnosis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vanessa, along with 49 Australians impacted by early onset bowel cancer, visited Canberra last month as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Bowel Cancer
        </a>
        Australia's annual Call On Canberra event. June also marked Bowel Cancer Awareness Month. Nineteen June was also Red Apple Day, the day that I managed to meet Vanessa. It is Bowel Cancer Australia's annual giving day. I was really pleased to hear the announcement by Minister Butler, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, that in the 2024-25 budget we are lowering the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program commencement age from 50 to 45. This change was implemented on 1 July and allows 45- to 49-year-olds to opt in to the program by requesting a testing kit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know it's not pretty. These kits come in the mail, and you have to go and do them. I'd encourage every Australian who gets the kit in the mail to go and do this test. It's important and it saves lives. Importantly, our budget also included $38 million to ensure that people who receive a positive screening result will be contacted to encourage appropriate follow-upâ€”again, critical if you get that test. The government will continue to work with

        on a $9 million campaign to encourage Australians to complete their bowel screening test kit. Thank you to Vanessa and thank you to all those Australians who are continuing to raise awareness about this dreadful disease.
