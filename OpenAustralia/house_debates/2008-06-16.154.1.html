       <p>
        I want to raise a matter to do with the most important project in the federal division of Mallee, and that is the piping of the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic system. It is appalling that before the last election we needed $248 million to finish this project, which, when it is finished, will represent an investment by the community, the state government of Victoria and the Commonwealth, in partnership, of just under $1 billion. Before the last election this was quite an issue: we needed $248 million to finish the project. The coalition in government at that stage committed $124 million, half of that $248 million, and the state government committed $99 million, expecting the community to pick up the rest. But, more than that, the then opposition and now the government also committed $124 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appalling for the government to stand at the dispatch box during a budget speech and say that they have honoured every commitment. Now Senator Wong, who is the relevant minister, has chosen to renege on that commitment of $124 million and make it only $99 million. That means the Commonwealth government now expects, in conjunction with the state government of Victoria, the community to pick up $50 million to finish this important project, on top of the $80 million they already have to pay through future arrangements through the lending authority. I think it is appalling. It is a good example of why people are so cynical about politicians and members of parliament.
