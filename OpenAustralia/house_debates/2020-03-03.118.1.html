         North Epping

        is the northernmost suburb of my electorate, framed on three sides by the upper reaches of the

        gives everything a peaceful air. Car noises are less obtrusive than the laughter of kookaburras and screeches of lorikeets. This is an idyllic and peaceful bush suburb, a world away from city cares.
       </p>
       <p>
        Epping North Public School is one of the ties that bind this community and the groups of parents that have formed and socialise at the local shops just after the school run for a coffee, chatting, laughing and building a sense of community. It was to one such group that tragedy struck last Friday morning. As a group was sitting in a cafe at Malton Road shops, a car came crashing through the garden and into the seating outside a popular local cafe, crushing some of the group against the wall. It seemed the car had been parking when it simply shot forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first reports were that there were 10 injured, one of whom was critical and was rushed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_North_Shore_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal North Shore Hospital
        </a>
        . Tragically, this mother of two died of her injuries later that dayâ€”a staggering blow to this peaceful community. Four more were also taken to hospital in a stable condition, and the remainder were treated by paramedics at the scene. Tributes have flowed in for the victim, and I would like to add my own heartfelt sorrow to her husband and family for their tragic loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also important to recognise, however, that the first on the scene were the local business owners. My office has been told that everyone in the nearby shops rushed out and were amongst the first people who administered first aid and assisted in the pulling of the car off those trapped. I'm so proud that these locals refused to stand by in the face of this tragedy and stepped up to help before the ambulances arrived.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention my sympathy for the driver. This was clearly an accident, though a heartbreaking one. The driver and his family will have some dark days ahead, and, while there are no words that can make this easier, do know our hearts go out to you as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        This accident will leave a scar on this close-knit community for years to come, and the family of the poor mother will not know happiness for some time. If there is any comfort to be found, it will come from the incredible North Epping community, who, I have no doubt, will rally around this young family that now finds itself without a mother. Our hearts and our prayers go out to you all.
