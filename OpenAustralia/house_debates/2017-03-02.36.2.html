        Twelve months ago, Labor announced our housing affordability policy, with reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax. That was 12 months ago. What has happened since? House prices continue to go up and the Treasurer continues to fail. We have seen double-digit growth in Sydney and Melbourne, we have seen Australia's major cities listed in the 20 least affordable cities around the world and we have seen the Treasurer lurch from excuse to excuse. The excuses are over, because our policy has been backed by a plethora of groups and eminent experts, from the Committee of

We're having real trouble getting negative gearing reform. Do you think you could come out and change your mind? I know I asked you to say it was a bad idea last year. Why don't you say it's a good idea today? I might get the numbers in the cabinet for once.' That is what the Treasurer is up to. The excuses are running out.
