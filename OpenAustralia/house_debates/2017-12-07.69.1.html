        I wish to congratulate the Randwick Botany
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">
         Little Athletics
        </a>
        Club, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this season. As it was the first Little Athletics club formed in Australia, the Randwick Botany Little Athletics Centre was given the honour of wearing the No. 1 on its competition shirts, and that number remains to this day. The driving force behind the formation of the club was Mr CD Hensley, or 'Chic', as he was known, and the club's athletics field at Pagewood is named in his honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Randwick Botany continues to be a strong club, with an average of 500 children signing up each season. Some notable names that have raced around the local track in the blue and yellow include

       <p>
        Then of course there are Tony and Judy Vecellio. They've been involved with the club for 40 years, Tony as the club president for the last 35 years. Rain, hail or shine, Tony never misses a training session or a Saturday at the track. Through their dedication to the club and their active coaching and support, many thousands of kids have come through the Randwick-Botany Harriers. So thanks to Judy and Tony and all concerned with Randwick Botany Little Athletics Club. Congratulations on your 50th anniversary.
