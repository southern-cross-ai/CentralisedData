        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister outline how the
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        will contribute to Australia's security, including our regional and global stability?

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I note that her electorate of Gilmore hosts over 1,600 members of the

         , with the associated defence industries. I know she has a deep interest in defence matters.

        <p>
         Under our
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         , Australia will be positioned to meet the challenges that could threaten peace and stability, particularly in our region, in the decades to come. We must safeguard regional security. That will safeguard trade and investment and will continue to support economic growth. Peace and stability are the precursors to prosperity.
        </p>

         We live in a time of more complex global challenges. During a recent meeting with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, he told me that he believes the world is facing the greatest period of instability since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . I note that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
          President Obama
         </a>
         has noted recently that UN peacekeeping operations are experiencing unprecedented strains. The conflict in Syria has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Brutal terrorists like Daesh continue to occupy territory in Syria and Iraq, while exporting globally their violent ideology and terrorist methods. The security situation in Afghanistan remains volatile. There is conflict and instability in many African countries. There are rising tensions in our region, with competing territorial claims in the east and south China seas.

         continues to threaten regional peace with its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Natural disasters will also continue to regularly afflict our region, with our defence forces increasingly being amongst the first responders.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through the white paper, the government will increase the ability of our defence forces to work in even deeper partnership with the United States and other key countries to address common threats and security challenges. The government will strengthen Australia's defence presence and cooperation in South-East Asia, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
          South Pacific
         </a>
         and North-East Asia in areas such as counter-terrorism, shared maritime security, science and technology, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. We will enhance global partnerships in defence to contribute to the maintenance of the international rules-based order.
        </p>
        <p>
         The resources the government commits to defence today will deliver the most capable Australian Defence Force Australia has ever had. The defence white paper sends a clear message that Australia is a significant and active contributor to regional and global security. We are committed to keeping our people and our nation safe. That is our highest priority.
