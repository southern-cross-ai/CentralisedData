       <p>
        Water plays a vital part of life. Tonight, I want to outline the need for bold water projects in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        to broaden the diversity and economic potential of my electorate of Capricornia. The northern Australia green paper is currently out for discussion on the future potential of food and fibre production north of the Tropic of Capricorn. Our government is also examining the future competitiveness of Australian agriculture via a white paper task force. Both are considering the need for new dam infrastructure. A third group examining our nation's future water needs is the ministerial task force on dams. I want to assure my electorate of Capricornia that I will be writing to the dam task force, urging it to consider funding infrastructure that will directly benefit Central Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we have coal, this industry is currently facing a price slump due to increased supply of poor-quality coal from China, the United States, Canada and Russia. We also have a significant beef industry, but, again, a flood of cattle onto the domestic market, due to Labor killing off our live export trade, continues to impact on domestic beef prices. These factors, affecting our two biggest industries, highlight the need for investment in infrastructure that enables us to diversify our regional industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Central Queensland there are many potential water projects now proposed that would benefit Capricornia, including: the Eden Bann and Rookwood Weir concept, Connors Dam, Urannah Dam and Nathan Dam. Local government is pushing to revitalise an old idea to create a food bowl in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_River" rel="nofollow">
         Fitzroy River
        </a>
        corridor near Rockhampton. Rockhampton's Fitzroy River is the second largest catchment area of its type in Australia, yet for decades it has noticeably lacked new and significant water infrastructure. To achieve a food bowl, with more feedlots, a bigger pork industry and horticulture, we would require two steps: firstly, raising the dam wall at Eden Bann Weir and, secondly, building a new weir at Rookwood, near Riverslea. Technically, both fall into the area of Flynn but would provide significant new agricultural diversity to the city of Rockhampton.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also need to fund Connors Dam in the Isaac regional shire. This project is shovel-ready and awaiting private or government funding. The dam will cost $1.3 billion, on the Connors River near Mount Bridgett, about 110 kilometres east of Moranbah and 70 kilometres south of Sarina. According to the Queensland Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, Connors Dam would supply over 373,000 megalitres. Water would be piped to Moranbah through a 133-kilometre pipeline to service local towns and coalmines. However, I urge this government to ensure that, if this project is funded, water is also allocated to diversify other industries in this region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Central Queensland can no longer rely just on coal. We must put in place new water infrastructure to diversify agriculture near Moranbah. This could include rice crops bred especially for Central Queensland conditions, more citrus and horticulture and further meat production. Recently, I met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Isaac Regional Council
        </a>
        and they are enthusiastic about getting the Connors project rolling to broaden the industry base in this part of Capricornia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another significant project that needs to be funded is the Urannah Dam, 60 kilometres south-west of Proserpine. The benefits of such a project are shared between my colleague George Christensen's electorate of Dawson and my own patch of Capricornia. According to regional economic group Bowen Collinsville Enterprise, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE" rel="nofollow">
         BCE
        </a>
        , the Urannah Dam could be used for organic horticulture and organic sugar production, as well as coalmining in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">
         Bowen Basin
        </a>
        , and to supply electricity for the town of Collinsville. Collinsville has been hit by bitter union industrial disputes, causing the local coalmine to close and reopen under changed conditions. BCE is adamant that Urannah would give Collinsville a new lease of life by offering new irrigation industries and employment opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, there is the Nathan Dam project at a cost of $1.4 billion. This would serve the Surat coal basin and the Dawson-Callide subregion of Central Queensland. Water from the dam may also supply the lower Fitzroy. Nathan Dam is expected to have a capacity of 888,000 megalitres.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to diversify the inland areas of Central Queensland in order to provide future jobs outside of our important coal sector. To do this we need water. I urge those pulling the purse strings to ensure that Capricornia, on the Tropic of Capricorn, is included in future spending on new dams and that we are not overlooked in favour of far north Australia.

         Before I call the honourable member for Lalor, I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that we have with us in the chamber Senator the Hon.
