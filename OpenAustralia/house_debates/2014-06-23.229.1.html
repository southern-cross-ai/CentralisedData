        I have great news for you, Deputy Speaker, and in fact for everyone who is listening: I have met and personally know Australia's next Steve Irwin. Australia's next Steve Irwin is a Casino lad, Brandon Gifford. He has won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Museum" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Museum
        </a>
        University of Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka Prize—get this—for the third year in a row and has been offered a position as a research associate at the Australian Museum. Brandon was a Casino High School student last year. He said it was incredible to win the prize for a third time, as it gives him a greater opportunity to spread a message of conservation. He was ecstatic to have been offered a position that would allow a bigger audience to see his documentaries. Brandon won this prize for his documentary
        <i>
         Spectacular Spider
        </i>
        , which was filmed, directed and narrated by the year 12 student.
       </p>

        As I said, this is the third of Brandon's documentaries to win the prize. He looked at snakes and lizards in previous years. In fact, he did a certificate I and certificate

        with my daughter Bridget, and I can tell you that he is an absolute ball of energy. He is going to be the next Steve Irwin, I tell you. He said he was determined to portray the plight of the misunderstood spiders and hoped that viewers would grow to respect them rather than fear them. He was more excited about communicating the conservation message to scientists and discussing how these three films have worked to promote conservation. He met
