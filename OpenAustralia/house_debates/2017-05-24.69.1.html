        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government is providing real needs based funding that is consistent across all states and territories and finally delivers on

         I thank the honourable member for her question. I can advise the honourable member that all the 48 primary and secondary schools and the more than 23,000 students in her electorate of Chisholm will benefit from the government's record investment in schools. This is what my government is delivering for schools: fair needs based funding that is consistent across every state and territory and is transparent and people can see what they are going to get. They can see the basis of the funding. They do not have to worry or wonder about 27 secret deals done by the Leader of the Opposition in the Gillard government—stitching up one deal after another, heedless of whether it was consistent or fair, just trying to get another signature on another piece of paper. So far did he travel from the recommendation of

          David Gonski
         </a>
         that Ken Boston himself, Gonski's co-panel member, described Labor's funding model as 'a corruption'—strong language.

             Our funding model is sector blind. It means that government, Catholic and independent schools are all funded based on need. Every school can find out what the funding is. And it is a record funding level this year and every year: $17½ billion this year, increasing to $30.6 billion in 2027. That is an extra $18.6 billion over the decade. No wonder it has been well received, because it is seen to be exactly what it should be: fair, needs based, consistent and transparent. Of course, transparency is not a long suit of the Leader of the Opposition—as his former union members used to find out—but neither is consistency.

             This is an opposition that, as we have seen, is trying to run a protection racket for the banks, which they claim to be wanting to bring to book. They will not fund the

              NDIS
             </a>
             , which the Leader of the Opposition spoke so warmly and proudly about. He asked whether I had been at some meetings with him when he was the parliamentary secretary for disabilities. Not surprisingly, I was not accompanying him around the countryside. But I tell you the meeting he has failed to turn up to—it is the meeting of this parliament when we vote to fund the NDIS. That is the question. It is all very well to showboat and grandstand, but an honest leader, a fair dinkum leader, funds the promises he makes. He has not done—
