         I do thank the member for Mayo. I acknowledge her strong interest in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is transforming the experience of Australians with disability, with some 250,000 Australians with disability now receiving support. A critical element of the experience that participants have with the National Disability Insurance Scheme is their plan, with developing the plan and then acting upon the plan. The plan will typically have within it a range of supports that are funded and then, under the principle of choice and control, it's open to the participant to go out to choose people to provide those support elements and spend the money that's allocated in the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that we have a process under which there is close engagement and consultation between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         participant or their parents or carers, where that's relevant, and with typically their local area coordinator. That's a process that occurs. It's often an interactive process. There is now a face-to-face meeting in every instance. That is something that has been in place from October of last year. What's also important is the work that we are doing to improve the participant pathways. For example, there are dedicated pathways for psychosocial disability. That allows specific expertise to be brought to bear to the particular circumstances of the person with disability.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a whole range of ways in which are working to improve the experience of participants as they engage with the NDIS. They have the option of seeking an internal review of their plan should they not be happy with it. They also have the option of a formal appeal to the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But there has to be a point at which the plan is finalised and when the participant knows with certainty that that funding is available. What can then happen is if they have concerns about the elements of the plan then there are options to seek a review or to seek an appeal. There are 250,000 Australians now being supported under the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and we're continuing to expand that number.
