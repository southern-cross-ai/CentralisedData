       <p>
        I have a question from the member for Watson but before we go to that, I want to make a statement on a question I was asked last time we sat. This is a question on the tabling of documents by private members.
       </p>
       <p>
        During question time on 15 May 2014, the member for Jagajaga sought leave to table a document during the response by the Prime Minister to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. A number of points of order were taken at the time and reference was made to earlier rulings concerning tabling of documents by private members. I said that I would look at the precedents and advise the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relevant standing order 199 provides that only ministers may table documents without leave and only when there is no motion before the House. Members other than ministers or parliamentary secretaries require leave of the House, at any time, to present documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two speakers have ruled on the question of the presentation of documents, by leave, by private members. In 2004, Speaker Hawker held that a request from a private member for leave to present a document during question time would not be put to the house where the document was already on the public record. In 2012, on four separate occasions, Speaker Jenkins stated that he would not permit a private member other than the person asking the question to seek to table a document during question time. Subsequent to Speaker Jenkins' departure from office his rulings were not sustained, with members other than the questioner being permitted to seek leave to table a document during question time.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I see it, the purpose of allowing a private member to present documents to the House is to inform the House in relation to the matter raised by that member in his or her remarks. What is not permitted is the use of this procedure as a disruptive device, particularly during question time. With this being the underlying principle, and consistent with earlier rulings, I propose to uphold the rulings of Speakers Hawker and Jenkins so that:
       </p>
       <p>
        (1) only the member speaking or, at question time, the questioner may seek leave to table a document and only then after the minister has concluded his or her answer;
       </p>
       <p>
        (2) a request by a private member to seek leave will not be put with a document is already on the public record;
       </p>
       <p>
        (3) a request to table by a private member will not be permitted when used as a disruptive device.
       </p>

         I will withdraw, but it was on the basis of the interjections by the member at the time.

          I do not care what the reason was. I find it an offensive interjection.
