        veteran Arthur Keith Pennell passed away on Sunday 24 July at the age of 96, surrounded by his family. Keith was a pillar of the local veterans community and Ipswich generally. A former citizen of the year, he served in the Australian General Transport Company and in Japan following the atomic bombing. He was a life member of the Ipswich

        Keith dedicated his life to supporting his fellow living veterans through volunteer work with the Ipswich Incapacitated Servicemen and Women's Association. He was a former president of the association and a pension welfare officer. It was an honour to present Keith with a commemorative medallion and certificate of commemoration at the 75th anniversary of the end of

        in 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        With his passing, we've lost another connection to that great generation who grew up in the Depression and served in World War II and then rebuilt our nation post-war. It's hard to describe with words the deep respect held for Keith in the Ipswich community. I want to pass on my sincere condolences to Keith's daughter Estelle, his family and his many friends, particularly those at Bundamba at this time. I can't be at the funeral service. Vale, Keith Pennell. Thank you for your service. Lest we forget.
