        On Saturday, 20 June, with my wife, Vicki, I attended a dinner celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Para Hills Community Club. In the early 1960s a committed group of residents who had settled in the newly established and growing suburb of Para Hills set about establishing a local community club in response to the social needs that were arising at the time. In 1969 their hard work culminated with the official opening of the Para Hills Community Club by the then

        parliament, were present at the celebration dinner, and it was fitting that they could both be there on the night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, the club has been enlarged and modernised, and today it is a stand-out community club in South Australia. It has also won numerous awards and accolades, including Best Community Club in South Australia for the last two consecutive years. Importantly, the club has not only provided a social, recreational and dining venue for the locals but, since 1969, has been a major financial supporter of the many sporting and community groups in the area. Over the years it has also raised tens of thousands of dollars for many worthwhile charities and causes, including the recent Victorian bushfires.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the dinner it was also wonderful to see some of the original Para Hills stalwarts and founders of the club, including Bob and Merian Giles, and Bill and Irene Redhead, who, after more than 40 years, are still keeping a watchful eye over their community’s needs. Adding to the celebration was popular long-time 5AA talkback host Tony Pilkington who emceed the evening and, with his wit and good humour, ensured that people were kept entertained throughout the evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay particular tribute to the club’s general manager, Cameron Taylor, who also happens to be the chairman of Clubs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">

        in South Australia; the club chairman, Chris Goldner; the deputy chairman, David Macdonald; and the entire Para Hills Community Club team for the leadership they have shown in recent years. They have not only ensured that the club adapted to the changing needs of the community but also ensured that the values of the original founders of the club of 40 years ago have been preserved. I wish the club well into the future.
