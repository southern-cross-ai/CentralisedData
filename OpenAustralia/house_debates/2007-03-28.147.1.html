        massacres in 1989. He was the convener of the Beijing Autonomous Workers Federation, the first independent labour organisation in mainland China in 50 years. He wished to build a workers federation that could monitor the

The Workers Federation was shut down as the Tiananmen Square protests came to a bloody end when the protestors were crushed by the tanks of the Chinese government on 4 June 1989. After the Tiananmen Square massacre, Han Dongfang was jailed for 22 months without trial, during which time he contracted tuberculosis. He was released from jail on the verge of death and soon after received an American visa for urgent medical treatment. He recovered in the

        program and he made some cynical but true comments about the recent decision of China’s National People’s Congress to legalise private property. In his view, it is very much like that of the Russian nomenklatura, after the fall of communism. In China’s case, the Communist Party is still in charge. This new law will give people the legal entitlement to enterprises that were illegally grabbed by members of the Chinese communist nomenklatura. His view is shared by
