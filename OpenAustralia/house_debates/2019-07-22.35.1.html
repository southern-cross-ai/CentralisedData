        Back in March, the Greens called on governments to step in and organise the urgent removal of flammable cladding from all high-risk buildings, to ban its importation and to implement a levy on developments to recoup the costs in solving this crisis. This call followed disastrous fires in Melbourne at the Lacrosse and Neo 200 buildings and conversations with affected residents in my electorate.

        have been working closely with the community to push for change, refusing to accept that the government has no responsibility to help people who are living in unsafe apartments. Last week, we welcomed the Victorian government's decision to adopt Greens policy to fund the rectification of buildings with flammable claddingâ€”the first step in dealing with this colossal failure of privatisation and poor regulation. This result is a testament to the hard work of the local community, but this rectification work needs to begin immediately in Victoria and across the country as well.

       <p>
        Taxpayers shouldn't be the only ones funding this. Once this cladding is removed, the government should pursue those companies who were responsible in court and implement a levy, if need be. While I am pleased that Premier Daniel Andrews has not ruled out investing more than $600 million, I am appalled that the federal government has refused to contribute just weeks after passing $158 billion in tax cuts. You have responsibility, Prime Minister, because the federal government let this flammable cladding into the country. This is a national issue and requires a national response. I know there'll be relief for many Victorians, but there's still plenty of work to do until everyone in Australia is safe.
