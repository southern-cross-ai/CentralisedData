       <p>
        On Sunday I joined the Outback Highway Development Council, who were in Canberra hosting their very first think tank on how to add value to the amazing road infrastructure that is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Outback Way
        </a>
        . Today they join me here in the chamber. The OHDC have done a terrific job over the past 26 years lobbying for and securing over $1.2 billion in federal, state and territory funding to literally pave the way across Australia, from Laverton in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        to Winton in western Queensland. This 2,700-kilometre highway will form Australia's longest shortcut, an iconic new trans-Australia tourism route and essential freight artery, linking WA to Queensland via the Red Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        The momentum has gathered, with seven shire councils across Australia collaborating to make the Outback Way a reality. Now it's time to focus on maximising the opportunities the Outback Way will present for communities along its length. Over the last two days, OHDC general manager Mel Forbes has led the charge in harnessing the enthusiasm of a new bunch of stakeholders who will help guide the next phase of the Outback Way development. They collaborated on ideas for Indigenous training, employment and business opportunities; bespoke outback tourism and cultural experiences; and of course essential communications infrastructure and support service provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        We heard from some terrific business owners like Kate McMaster, whose family has lived on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenty_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for five generations. She owns and operates Gemtree, a unique gemstone museum and fossicking experience.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a 38-year tourism industry veteran, maintained that a unique point of difference will attract travellers to explore a new 'road less travelled'. Graeme Hoare, of the Livestock and Rural Transporters Association, affirmed that this new trans-Australia route will improve market access for livestock year round and enable the relocation of animals during drought or flood.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Outback Way will also provide a shorter, more direct route for the interstate movement of freight which is currently shipped by the main southern freight route. For communities along the Outback Way, this will deliver food security, counterseasonal variety and healthier fresh food. Additionally, the Outback Way will connect Australia's most remote communities to each other, availing them of better health, education and social opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I would like to thank everyone who has added to the collaborative efforts and legacies of the shires along the Outback Way, their mayors, shire presidents, councillors and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        s, who over the last 26 years have committed funding and in-kind works to help build the Outback Way. The Outback Way is truly a nation-building project, and we will all be proud to look back and say we were part of building not only the physical road but the human capital along the way. Well done.
