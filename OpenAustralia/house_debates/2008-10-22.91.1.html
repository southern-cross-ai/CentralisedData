       <p>
        Children often know better than adults, and they know one thing very early on in their lives—that is, riding a bike is one of the greatest things you will ever do. They absolutely love it and they love it for many years, sometimes until they become adults. Unfortunately, then they forget; there seems to be a strange metamorphosis that takes place. Children understand it but adults forget—well, not all adults. In our capital cities most trips involve stop-start driving or short trips, with around 50 per cent of trips being less than five kilometres. Some 300 grams of greenhouse gas emissions is saved per kilometre for every vehicle that is taken off our roads. Potentially this totals an average of more than four tonnes of emissions per vehicle every year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia it is estimated that, in a single year, air pollution from motor vehicles causes between 900 and 2,000 early deaths and between 900 and 4½ thousand cases of bronchitis and cardiovascular and respiratory disease, costing between $1.5 billion and $3.8 billion. Riding to work is a great way of getting fitter, having fun, reducing traffic congestion and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. How do I know this? Firstly, because I have done a bit of research and, secondly, because I am an enthusiastic cyclist. I have been ever since I was a child—and some might say that I still am a child, but either way I am very proud to be a cyclist. For many years I actually did follow completely some of my philosophies in terms of riding to work and not using a car at all. I did that for a number of years and it was one of the greatest things I ever did. It gave me time to think. It often meant that I was riding past a whole heap of traffic sitting in the city on some of our arterial roads that are completely clogged. I actually beat them to work. In the 30-odd kilometres that I had to ride from my home to the city I would actually beat most of the traffic in over the same distance. Fortunately, I had the luxury of having a shower at my workplace and so I could leave some clothes there or take them in a backpack.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many other reasons to promote cycling and I want to list four examples simply to demonstrate the long-term impacts of cycling and what it can do. Firstly, as Australia’s population ages there will be increasing pressure on our already stretched healthcare system. Much of that pressure will come from the diseases, such as diabetes, associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Around 70 per cent of Australians over the age of 15 are said to be living sedentary lifestyles. Regular cycling represents one of the most effective and practical ways of tackling these preventable diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, cycling has been shown to reduce stress and improve general wellbeing. Having fun is definitely the best medicine. Thirdly, statistics show that nearly one-third of commuters in major cities spend more time stuck in traffic than they do with their own children. Cycling will reduce congestion and its related cost and maybe give people a little bit of time on the weekends to do something with their kids that they all really enjoy. Finally, if we could convert just a few journeys in our working week into bike journeys we could make a significant dent in our individual emissions footprints. That is why I applaud the policies, the projects and the initiatives that deliver increased options for active transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Active transport is defined as a physical activity undertaken as a means of transport and not purely as a form of recreation. Active transport generally refers to walking and cycling for travel to and from a destination but may also include other activities such as skateboarding or use of public transport. Many people find that choosing active transport options is an effective way to build physical activity into their daily routines and busy schedules. Active transport has the added benefit to communities and the environment of reduced traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. And no-one could argue with the fact that for every biker on the road that is one less car. And there is plenty of evidence and pictures to demonstrate how significant that is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local councils are doing a great job on the cycling infrastructure front. Millions of dollars, in fact, are being committed to innovative projects such as the brand new

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City" rel="nofollow">

        . I note the member for Ryan is in the chamber. He is from Brisbane and I am sure that he has had a look at the centre or at least knows where it is. It is a great facility and it makes a real difference. The states are doing their bit. I think councils are starting to do their bit and I want the federal government to do a little bit as well. There is at the moment a submission to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        for a more efficient and sustainable national transport network, looking at the efficiency of Australia’s transport system and the quality of life in our cities through the development and improvement of cycling networks, which I think are as important as any other transport network in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been demonstrated overseas what the benefits and effects can be. It is incredible what cycling can produce, including a healthy lifestyle that benefits individual people. I encourage every member of the House to get active in cycling. Every Wednesday morning at 6.30 in front of the House of Representatives there is always somebody to go for a ride with you if you want to come along.
