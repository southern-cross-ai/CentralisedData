        I would like to bring to the attention of the House the wonderful Dungog Festival, and also congratulate the Dungog community for their wonderful festival, which I attended with my wife, Charlotte. There were many highlights of the Dungog Festival, which ran for several days, and they included a film festival, art shows, the classic long table lunch, which is probably the biggest table lunch in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">

        , as well as many other musical events. But I want to particularly highlight the unique, inaugural and highly successful Sculpture on the Farm event. It was a resounding success due to the hard work of Philippa Graham; her husband, John; and the committee. It was set up as a non-profit entity with a focus on regional tourism—you only need to look at what they have done for Dungog with Sculpture on the Farm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 2,000 people attended their farm at Fosterton, which was opened to display 51 national and international renowned sculptures, both large and small. Some of the pieces you might have seen at events like Sculpture by the Sea. Over time Sculpture on the Farm will increase in its stature, but over 2,000 people turned up. It was a great event for the whole community to help contribute to. The Hilldale Union Church committee catered for the crowd, and they raised funds at the same event. Annabelle Rossini's coffee cart, which supports education for women in Africa, provided coffee refreshments. Dungog Rotary assisted on the gate, and Dungog Rural Fire Service members managed the parking and traffic. So it was an all-of-community event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to personally congratulate Philippa and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham" rel="nofollow">

        . They donated $10,000 for the inaugural prize. The winner was a magnificent piece: Braddon Snape's work 'Nothin' but Sky'. This piece will be donated to the community and placed in a prominent town within the

        . The aim of Sculpture on the Farm is to keep raising money and to develop a suite of sculptures to place in all the villages around the Dungog Shire.
       </p>
       <p>
        So put it in your diary for next year—4 to 7 October. The Dungog Festival is for everyone to come and enjoy. And, in the meantime, if you're bored, come up to Dungog on 9 and 10 November for the annual show. Thanks very much.
