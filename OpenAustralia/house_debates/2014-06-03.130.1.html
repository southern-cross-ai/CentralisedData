        I rise to speak on the subject of medical research and the scientists who do this work. I rise to speak in particular about the

         Royal Melbourne Hospital
        </a>
        's Research Hall of Fame. In 1848 a small group of visionary Victorians came together to open Victoria's first public hospital. Since that time the Royal Melbourne Hospital has become the linchpin of the Parkville Precinct's leading biomedical research hub and a magnet for some of the brightest minds in medical research. As Victoria's first hospital, the Royal Melbourne Hospital has seen many pioneering innovations in medicine and health care. Many of these innovations have had a real and lasting impact on health care today, not just in Australia but around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a few weeks—on Saturday, 21 June 2014—the Royal Melbourne Hospital will celebrate its rich history and bright future in medical research by launching the Research Hall of Fame and the inaugural Royal Melbourne Hospital Research Medal for a mid-career investigator. The special evening will honour the research legends of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, whose courage and brilliance has changed the face of medicine over the past century and before. They dared to challenge conventions of their day, and their legacy inspires today's researchers.
       </p>

        These are great researchers, whose contributions will live through the lives that they have improved and lives that they have saved.
