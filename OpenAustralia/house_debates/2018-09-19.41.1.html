       <p>
        Labor has been saying for some time that Australia's aged-care system is a system in crisis. It is a system in crisis because this Prime Minister, as Treasurer, cut almost $2 billion out of the sector and is sitting on dozens of reports into what is wrong, but refuses to act. This side of the House welcomes the royal commission into aged care, but the royal commission must look at all aspects of the aged-care system. It must look at the impact of the Prime Minister's cuts, it must look at the future funding sustainability of the sector and it must look at workforce issues and workers' pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        The royal commission is very important to Tasmania. According to the ABS census, Tasmania's population is the oldest and is ageing faster than any other part of Australia. Almost 20 per cent of our population is 65 years old or older. In my electorate, between the years 2011 and 2016, the community of Latrobe saw the greatest increase in its population in those aged over 65. Tasmanians need, right now and into the future, quality aged care. It is for these reasons the Prime Minister must ensure the royal commission holds public hearings in Tasmania. The banking royal commission did not, sadly, run anything in Tasmania, meaning that Tasmanians were forced to travel interstate just to be heard. There is no reason why Tasmanians should be treated any differently. I call on the Prime Minister to ensure Tasmania is not left off the map again.
