       <p>
        I rise to speak about the charitable efforts of my constituent Dr Joanna Tait and the WANTZ Committee. This is a fundraising committee who have sought no recognition, but I've taken it upon myself to recognise them in this place because of the outstanding work they do. The fundraising committee was formed in 2003 from likeminded friends to provide some very practical assistance to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year they choose a charity to support and raise funds for nominated equipment. They have raised over $2 million from 2003, their formation, to 2018. What's special about this fundraising committee is it is a committed group of local residents and 100 per cent of all the funds raised go directly to the charity that they have nominated. They take no wages and they cover the cost themselves of operating their activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year the highlight of their fundraising activities is their annual fundraising dinner. I was there last year at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_House" rel="nofollow">
         Customs House
        </a>
        . It was a very, very enjoyable night. This year it is on the 24 August and they are supporting the Hear and Say centre. This is a perfect example of what I spoke about in my maiden speech of residents who are rolling up their sleeves for their community and giving back. I urge Ryan residents to support their charitable efforts. Again, I congratulate Joanna Tait and the whole WANTZ Committee for their selfless fundraising efforts.
