        I rise today to honour the fine Australians who are part of Legacy. In the trenches of the

        during

        </a>
        , a soldier said to his dying mate: 'I'll look after the missus and kids.' This became known as 'the Promise', and it is still kept today. Realising the dire circumstances of the tens of thousands of veterans, and widows and children left behind, those who returned set out to help them. In 1923, Major General Sir John Gellibrand formed the Remembrance Club in Hobart. Another returned soldier, Lieutenant General Sir Stanley Savige, was inspired to establish a similar club in Melbourne, which was named Legacy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legacy Club started as a small organisation with local legatees assisting local families. Today, there are 44 Legacy clubs across Australia, plus one in London, providing emotional, social and financial support. Legacy is truly Australian and unique across the world in providing for the families of those who have died or given their health in service for this great country.
       </p>

        With the outbreak of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a war orphans appeal started in 1942 to raise funds for the widows and children of soldiers who did not return. Today this appeal is known as Legacy Week. Legacy Week is now the single major fundraising initiative by Legacy, and it's primarily centred on selling Legacy badges to the public. Since the legacy promise was made by that soldier to his dying mate, Legacy has supported
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        families in times of great need. Today Legacy is still caring for 40,000 of the partners and children who have lost their loved ones who gave their health serving our country and have been affected by their partner's service in any wars, conflicts or peacekeeping operations Australia has been involved in.
       </p>
       <p>
        Originally, it was returned servicemen who took this duty of caring for and supporting widows and children. They later became known as legatees. To this day it is the legatees, of which there are over 3,400, who volunteer the support that Legacy provides to its beneficiaries. This work can mean a child gets an education and a fair go, a widow is not disadvantaged and alone and a family is not torn apart by the effects of post-traumatic stress or other psychological issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year is the centenary of Legacy, and it's being celebrated through the whole country by a Legacy torch relay that will access each state and territory after starting in France, then going to London, before concluding in Melbourne.

        to develop a Legacy coin and stamp to commemorate Legacy's centenary year. I look forward to continuing my relationship with Legacy and supporting them and their beneficiaries wherever possible, and I encourage all Australians to buy a badge during Legacy Week, which starts 27 August, so this magnificent legacy can be continued for as long as we have those who need to be supported because of the sacrifice of a loved one.
