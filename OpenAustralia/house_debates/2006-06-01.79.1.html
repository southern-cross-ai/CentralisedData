       <p>
        Bearing in mind the member for Braddon’s comments on the contribution made by the member for Gorton, I would like to reassure the House that, notwithstanding the very poor level of illumination in the House at the moment, this is not a case of the blind leading the blind. Mr Speaker, you will doubtless recall my having sought your assistance under standing order 105(b) after question time today in relation to some important questions on the

          Notice Paper
         </a>
        </i>
        . I made reference to questions on security in the baggage handling area at Sydney (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kingsford Smith
        </a>
        ) Airport. I want to draw it to the House’s attention that, on 28 March, I put follow-up questions 3256, 3257, 3258 and 3259—and, on 30 March, question 3391—to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs in relation to the two closed circuit security cameras at Sydney airport which had been interfered with on three occasions between October 2004 and October 2005. I want to remind the House that, in October 2004,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schapelle_Corby" rel="nofollow">
         Schapelle Corby
        </a>
        went through Sydney airport and something like $10 million worth of cocaine went through Sydney airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very serious episode. I want to express my grave concern that it took Senator Ellison nine months to answer my questions and he has taken a further two months to tell the people of Australia what has happened in relation to the inquiries, investigations, findings and conclusions that were made in relation to the two cameras that were sabotaged on three separate occasions. It is a very serious issue. People want to know that when they check their luggage in it is safe.
