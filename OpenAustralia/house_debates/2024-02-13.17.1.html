       <p>
        Yesterday I am sure many of us here witnessed the final arc in the
        <i>
         Nemesis
        </i>
        saga. By that I mean the nemesis to hardworking Australians. Ever since the closing the loopholes bill was introduced into this place, we have seen those opposite do everything in their power to get in the way of workers being able to earn more and keep more, especially when they have to work more. We saw pathetic displays from those opposite, starting with complaints about having to read the bill, let alone consider it. But we always knew whose side they were on, and it wasn't going to be on the side of workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those opposite, throughout this entire debate, have seemed to be the largest supporters amongst the parliament of a right to disconnectâ€”but only when it concerns themselves. They will defend their God-given right to disconnect from reality and to disconnect from any semblance of rational thought when it comes to debate on industrial relations. They are disconnected from everyday Australians, and that has been as clear as day, combating the nemesis opposite in their intent to disconnect the working people of this country from working conditions. This government will always have the backs of Australian workers, working to ensure that they will be earning more and keeping more.
