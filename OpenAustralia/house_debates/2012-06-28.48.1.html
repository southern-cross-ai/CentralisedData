       <p>
        My mother in her last few years had type 2 diabetes so I point out that National Diabetes Week is coming up, from 8 to 14 July. I am proudly wearing my diabetes pin, which is about turning diabetes around. Unfortunately, diabetes is Australia's fastest growing chronic disease, with up to 1,500 people being diagnosed per week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to speak about the schools chaplaincy program. I wish to congratulate my colleague Minister Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and the federal Labor government for swiftly introducing legislation to ensure the National Schools Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program continues in my electorate of Moreton. I also note the support of the opposition. The Gillard Labor government has acted quickly to protect this important program, meaning that 26 schools in Moreton will continue to receive funding for the scheme. This means that payments that were due to some service providers by the end of this financial year can still go ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a former teacher, I understand how valuable this program is to schools, students and parents and I am pleased that this community program will continue to be funded. I have seen first-hand the great work of school chaplains in our local schools and I am relieved that the parliament has been able to quickly resolve this issue. Once passed, the legislation will ensure that chaplains and welfare workers continue to be funded and services continue to be supplied in schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gillard government has provided an additional $222 million for the program over the next three years and has extended it to an extra 1,000 schools this year. I welcome the government's ongoing commitment to this program in schools such as Acacia Ridge State School, Brisbane Christian College, Coopers Plains State School, Corinda State High School, Corinda State School, Eight Mile Plains State School, Graceville State School, Macgregor State High School, Macgregor State School, Milperraâ€” (
