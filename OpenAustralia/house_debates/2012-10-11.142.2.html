        I must officially congratulate the member for Hindmarsh on his elevation to Second Deputy Speaker. I will miss him as Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Health and Ageing, but I am sure he will be replaced by someone equally capable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I rise to speak about the 10th anniversary of the tragic Bali bombings, which will be commemorated tomorrow. Both here in Australia and in Bali friends, families, survivors and supporters of those who suffered during this cowardly act of terrorism will stand side by side in memory of the tragic event. Two hundred and two people, including 88 Australians and 39 Indonesians, were killed at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Sari Club
        </a>
        on the night of 12 October 2002. Even more were injured and airlifted to Australia for treatment. Our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        were instrumental in treating victims on the ground and setting up makeshift hospitals to treat not just Australians but all those injured.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tomorrow we will be not only remembering the events of 12 October but also celebrating the ever-strengthening relationship between Indonesia and Australia. I have spoken before in this place about a wonderful bilateral organisation that was founded in Perth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , in 2008 called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bali Peace Park
        </a>
        organisation. This not-for-profit organisation is supported by Australian federal and state governments to bring together survivors, families, friends and supporters of those affected by the Bali bombings, as well as Balinese and Indonesian government officials. The organisation has a mission statement of 'striving to help build a future without fear by promoting tolerance, understanding and freedom for generations to come'. The Bali Peace Park organisation has helped many Australians and Indonesians come to terms with the horrific terror attacks and move on in cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the organisation's beginning in 2008, I have sought to keep the House up to date with the Bali Peace Park's goal to create a spiritual garden on the Sari Club site for persons to reflect upon and acknowledge the terrorist attack on 12 October 2002. At the moment the site is being used as a makeshift car park and the organisation is in ongoing negotiations with the owners of the land. I wish the organisation every success with these endeavours. I have also had the opportunity to meet with the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, and promote the ideals of the Bali Peace Park organisation to him and seek his assistance in reaching the goal of turning the Sari Club site into a memorial, a spiritual garden.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tomorrow morning I will be attending the peace park's annual dawn service at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Park" rel="nofollow">
         King's Park
        </a>
        in Perth with WA Premier Colin Barnett and many members of the public. The support for this service continues to grow year after year and is a testament to the spirit of the survivors and the supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing I would like to acknowledge one of the patrons of the Bali Peace Park, Dr Fiona Wood. Dr Wood pioneered groundbreaking medical technology to treat the burns and save the lives of many injured in the blast. It is people like Dr Wood, our Defence Force and heroic survivors who have pioneered through heartbreak to create a strong and supportive network. They deserve to be celebrated on 12 October each year.
