        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister please update the House on the Defence Force's Operation COVID-19 Assist and advise how the Morrison government is working to keep Australians safe during the pandemic?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. Like all Australians, I'm incredibly proud of the work that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         have done right across the country, not only in relation to the fires and floods and a cyclone but, most importantly, in their continued effort in relation to the COVID-19 response. The work of the Australian Defence Force, where they have provided support to Australians, not just in Victoria, has been quite remarkable and they should be commended. In many cases, they've spent a lot of time away from their family and friends. They have held up the best in our Australian Defence Force, and we should be very proud of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to acknowledge the efforts of Commodore Eric Young
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
          CSC
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAN" rel="nofollow">

         for his work in the vaccine operations centre—the work that he has done in leading the people within that centre, providing his special support in logistics and planning—and the whole team that works with him. Defence vaccine delivery teams have delivered vaccines in 181 aged- and disability-care centres. Sometimes these are very, very difficult cases, particularly those with disabilities who have comorbidities and other health needs and issues and anaphylactic reactions in some cases. All of that needs to be taken into consideration by the health teams as they roll out that vaccination program.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Defence Force has provided significant efforts in protecting the cybersecurity and providing advice and assistance in this regard to key entities involved in the vaccine supply chain through the Australian Cyber Security Centre. It's almost unbelievable to conceive that organised criminal groups and, indeed, state actors would seek to exploit the health information and patient records of aged-care facilities, of health facilities and of state health authorities that hold important, confidential and essential information, but that is the case. So the work of the Australian Defence Force, along with the staff of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Home Affairs

         , is absolutely crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
         Operation COVID-19 Assist has seen the ADF deliver significant support to the Victorian government throughout the pandemic. Over the course of the pandemic, almost 4,000 ADF members have been deployed in Victoria as part of the operation. Since the start of the pandemic, those personnel have undertaken tasks in Victoria, including planning logistics support to the Victorian government, manufacturing facemasks, border control, quarantine compliance, clinical testing, community engagement, contact tracing, support to

         , logistical and clinical support to the Aged Care Response Centre and vaccination of aged-care and disability residents. As we speak, 218 personnel are employed in Victoria currently providing support, in particular, to the
