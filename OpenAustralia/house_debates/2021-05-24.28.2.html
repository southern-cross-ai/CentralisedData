       <p>
        I wish to draw the attention of members to the current arrangements in this chamber and the Federation Chamber and for committee rooms. Any changes are of course in line with the current COVID-safe advice and will remain in place unless circumstances change. Arrangements for the operation of this chamber and the Federation Chamber will remain much as they were in budget week and the same arrangements will remain for the use of party rooms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The easing of COVID restrictions means that committee rooms can now accommodate more people at any one time. Committee rooms will now have COVID
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR" rel="nofollow">
         QR
        </a>
        codes at their entrances so that people can be contacted, if necessary, by COVID contact tracers. By now, we are all well practised in the use of QR codes. They are one of the precautions that allow us to increase the number of occupants in the committee rooms. All committee room occupants, including members, committee witnesses and staff, are strongly encouraged to scan into the rooms when they attend their meetings. Members and all other building occupants are reminded to continue to follow COVID-safe practices, including frequent use of hand sanitiser and handwashing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The President of the Senate and I continue to take regular advice from the medical authorities on appropriate COVID procedures. Arrangements in the chambers and at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will be adjusted as required to reflect the expert advice, and I will continue to keep members up to date. I thank the House. I just thought members would want to hear that firsthand, with respect to committee rooms.
