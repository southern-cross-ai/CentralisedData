       <p>
        I rise this morning to place on the record my dismay and sadness at the fate of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_Knowledge" rel="nofollow">
         Tree of Knowledge
        </a>
        in Barcaldine in my electorate of Maranoa after it was poisoned earlier this year. Just last week this historic tree was officially declared dead. The iconic tree is an important part of Australia’s history. It symbolises part of our political history and tells a story of the early struggles faced by the people of western Queensland. In fact, in January this year, the federal government recognised the importance of the Tree of Knowledge by its inclusion in the National Heritage List.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story is that on 1 May 1891 striking shearers marched through the streets of Barcaldine and met under this historic ghost gum. This strike, in conjunction with the maritime strike of 1890, was a very important event in the history of Queensland and Australia. These events led to the creation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , but the tree and what it represented in relation to the pastoralists and grazier industries was also fundamental in their joining together as a union of employers and establishing the pastoralists and graziers association, and later the United Graziers Association of Queensland, who put forward candidates and established a push for a political party which became the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Country Party
        </a>
        and of course today
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
         The Nationals
        </a>
        . So it has a significant part in the history of two political parties in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I first heard of the poisoning in May of this year, I was hopeful that the damage caused by this cowardly act would not permanently damage the tree. After all, the 150-year-old 10-metre ghost gum had survived some of the harshest droughts ever recorded in our history. Ultimately, this untimely loss of such an iconic tree is a bitter blow for the people of Barcaldine, who had worked hard to preserve this unique part of Australia’s history and heritage. It was also a major tourist attraction for the region which assisted in the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I believe the demise of the tree should not close the investigation to find the person or people who were responsible for poisoning the tree. Whoever is responsible for such an un-Australian act should be dealt the full force of the law. I join with the people of Barcaldine, who I know will not rest until the perpetrator or perpetrators are brought to justice. I hope that the $10,000 that has been offered, I understand, by the Australian Labor Party as a reward for information will lead to a conviction. This is an important part of our national history and heritage. It has been destroyed by irresponsible people and we must make sure that we leave no stone unturned in trying to bring people to face the law because of their action.
