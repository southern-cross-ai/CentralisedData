         HMAS Albatross

        is the centre of the Royal Australian Navy's maritime aviation capability, supporting operations of one training helicopter squadron and two operational helicopter squadrons. This proposal is at an estimated cost of $192 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        to upgrade and replace ageing, obsolete and, in some cases, potentially unsafe infrastructure to improve the functionality and capability of the facilities at HMAS Albatross to support Navy's training and operational requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal will provide a comprehensive engineering services upgrade, new refurbished working accommodation, a new hot refuelling capability, works to provide increased future airside development space and demolition of redundant facilities at HMAS Albatross. The capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Shoalhaven region and local industry with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin mid-next year with completion expected in mid-2015. I commend the motion to the House.

        is the primary officer training base for the RAAF and is also a main operating air base, providing continuous support to two operational squadrons, visiting operational squadrons, minor exercises and operations and contracted research and rescue operations. The RAAF base redevelopment project estimated at $185.6 million plus GST proposes to improve the functionality and capability of the base by upgrading or replacing inadequate and non-compliant facilities, infrastructure and engineering services to meet current and anticipated future requirements. The proposal will provide major engineering services upgrades, new and refurbished working accommodation, new and refurbished training and maintenance facilities, security upgrades, a new air traffic control complex, new commercial, community and chapel facilities, a new firing range, new living-in accommodation and demolition of redundant facilities at RAAF Base East Sale.
