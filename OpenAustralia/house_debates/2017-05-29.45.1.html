       <p>
        I want to express to the House my appreciation of Adani for their commitment to purchase $74 million work of steel rail from

        . I am very concerned at the moment about the vacillation of the Queensland government, who do not seem to know whether they are coming or going on this issue. I, the electorate of Grey and, most specifically, the people of Whyalla have a special interest in this issue. We are reaching the pointy end of the negotiation of a successful sale of Arrium and, coming on top of the order from the Commonwealth government for the Adelaide to Tarcoola line, the $49 million loan for the two new beneficiation plants in the nearby mines is sending a strong signal to the buyers that there is a great future for Whyalla and for making steel in Australia.

        Backing the Adani mine is backing Australian jobs. I cannot tell this House just how vital the Arrium business is to the city of Whyalla and the material impact a loss of this order would have on its future. My great concern is that the Queensland government is succumbing to organised pressure from the extreme left, with no less than a

        ! campaign. Just to put people in the picture, I had a call to my office in the last couple of days from a constituent who expressed opposition to the Adani mine going ahead. Once we discussed the issue with her and found out the problems, she said: 'I don't know anything about this, but I was told by GetUp! to ring.' She was told to ring about something that she knew nothing about.
