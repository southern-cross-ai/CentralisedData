        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        has a rich bushranging history, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Hall
        </a>
        to Jessie Hickman, who was known locally as the 'lady bushranger'. But tonight we celebrate the exploits of the latter day Lady Bushrangers, and I speak of course of the Bathurst Bushrangers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        Club women's side, who have just claimed their second Central West AFL title, making it two in a row—a mighty effort from the Bushrangers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, it was their second title in a row, playing at Cowra's Mulyan Oval. It was a very close match—a tough encounter—but the Bushrangers triumphed 4-7-31 to 2-1-13 over a gallant Orange Tigerettes side. There is a great rivalry between those clubs. The Tigerettes fought very hard and they did the Orange community proud, but it was the Lady Bushrangers who prevailed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I need to make special mention of all of those Lady Bushrangers in the side, including Taylor Armstrong; Lauren Barnett; Mikala Bringolf, who was named best on ground; Paige Cuy; Mariah Gilchrist; Isabella Giuliano; Abbey Hardie; Selina Harlum; Elise Hull; Monique Price; Courtney Pring;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Rose" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Rose
        </a>
        ; Jessica Scadding; Rachael Schumack; and also 'captain courageous',
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kelsey Smith
        </a>
        , who did a wonderful job. She kicked a major in the third quarter, along with Keeghan Tucker. I have to say that Keeghan Tucker was recently named the Central West AFL's best and fairest: 36 goals for the season, Mr Speaker—I know you are an AFL fan. She had two in the final and she has recently trialled with the Greater Western Sydney Giants. I can see you nodding in approval, Mr Speaker.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also need to mention Sarah Stackman, Sophie Thrower, Sarah Weal, Victoria Weal, Hollie Whitla and Tori Whitla. I also need to mention the coach,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Trevor Brown
        </a>
        , who was effusive in his praise of the side—but obviously they are very well coached. And I also need to mention team manager, Helen Price, team physio,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Helen Brown
        </a>
        and also all the other support staff, including Sharron Stevens.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bathurst Bushrangers is a wonderful club, and I also need to make special mention of Graeme Grundy, who is the president; Brian Matheson, who is the vice president; Jo Howard, who is the secretary; David Flude, who is the treasurer;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Ross" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Ross
        </a>
        , who is the players representative;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Lewis
        </a>
        , the registrar;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Fuller" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Fuller
        </a>
        , the match day manager; and Helen Price, who is the social committee member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, we all wish Keeghan all the best in her efforts, not only for next season but also, hopefully, she will get a berth at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWS" rel="nofollow">
         GWS
        </a>
        Giants. We have the inaugural women's AFL competition about to launch next year, so this is a very exciting time for Keeghan and indeed for all women who are playing AFL, not only in the Central West but right around New South Wales and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also need just to mention Bathurst Giants pair, Cooper Brien and Ben Cant, who took out the under-12s and 14s best and fairest awards at the recent Central West presentation. They did an excellent job there. I will also mention Bushrangers pair, Peter Grundy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Waterson" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Waterson
        </a>
        , who finished inside the top three for the senior best and fairest honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a wonderful sporting history and heritage out in the Central West of New South Wales, but we are all very proud of what the Lady Bushrangers have achieved. They are obviously a very tight unit, with two premierships in a row, and I believe that we are going to see great things from them next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not want to take anything away from the Orange side. There is always a tough competition between Orange and Bathurst in these local derbies, but this year it was the Lady Bushrangers who prevailed for the second year in a row. I would formally like to pass on the congratulations of this House, the Australian parliament, to the Bathurst Lady Bushrangers on a job well done for 2016.
