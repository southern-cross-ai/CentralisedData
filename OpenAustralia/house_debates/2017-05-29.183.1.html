       <p>
        Just after dawn on Anzac Day, I was with many thousands of my constituents at Epping
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , reflecting on a typically beautiful Anzac Day service, when Herb Mason, the president of the Epping RSL, announced that he would be stepping down as president. Herb had served the Epping RSL as its president for 18 years, an extraordinary contribution to the RSL and to the wider community, and had been involved in the organisation for many years before that. Herb's departure will be deeply felt in the community, so it is appropriate that I acknowledge his contribution in this place, as well as his wider contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Herb joined the army in 1962 and fought for Australia in Vietnam. When he returned, he continued to serve his community, being a member of the RSL all of that time. He is described by those who know him best as loyal and hardworking, and I know both these things to be true. I also know him to be a good friend, a confidant and a great source of advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Herb saw his role as president of the RSL as looking out, not looking in. He made an extraordinary contribution to the northern suburbs' commemoration of Anzac Day a couple of years ago. I know that he has left the Epping RSL in very good hands. I also know he will not be absent from community life, but I do take this opportunity to acknowledge an extraordinary constituent and a great human being.
