        Recently I was approached by a very impressive young Geraldton woman who wanted to talk about the Abbott budget. She felt it was very tough on single parents who needed more help to build their capacity to support themselves. Sara is a single mother with a four-year-old boy. Two years ago she went back to study and obtained a Cert
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">

        in Beauty Therapy and various related qualifications. She has now established her own business at home and is gradually building up her client base, and she hopes to be financially independent in the next few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sara explained she could not have done any of this without, firstly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JET" rel="nofollow">
         JET
        </a>
        Child Care Fee Assistance program. Sara could not have afforded day care costs from her parenting payment alone. That entitlement has now been cut so that full time study will be much harder. Secondly she relied on the Education Entry Payment to cover her fees and the cost of transport each day. She was very clear that without that payment she would have struggled to cover these costs. This payment has now been abolished. Sara agrees that we need to encourage supporting parents to become independentâ€”but you do not do that by cutting the childcare and fees assistance that makes it possible for these young parents to get the skills they need to re-enter the workforce.
