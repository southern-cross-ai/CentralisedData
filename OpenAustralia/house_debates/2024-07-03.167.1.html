        I rise to pay my respects and acknowledge the passing of Eamon George Lynham, the youngest of the four sons of Dr Anthony Lynham, former state member for Stafford, and his wife, Pam. The electorate of Stafford is partly in my electorate of Lilley. Eamon's life was cut short on 25 May 2024, at the age of just 28. He had been ill for some months following a diagnosis of cancer.

        This young man was described by friends and family as shy and reserved, highly intelligent and with a very quick wit. His father, Anthony, told the story about how he was determined that his four sons would all participate in some form of sport, but Eamon hated sport. He hated watching sport. He hated playing sport. He was happiest with his friends, spending hours upon hours online gaming. No-one was happier than Eamon when it was announced that eSports would be introduced in the 2028 Olympics. It was no surprise that Eamon's love of eSports translated to a fulfilling career in the

        industry, where he made so many friends. Many of those work colleagues joined family and friends at a memorial service celebrating Eamon's life on 30 May, a service that was so well attended that the chapel opened all the doors and all the windows so that the large crowd outside could participate and show their respects as well. To Eamon's parents, Pam and Anthony, to his partner, Bronte, and to his three brothers, Brayton, Rohan and Sean, I send my very heartfelt sympathies.

        During National Volunteer Week in May, I had the opportunity to express my deep gratitude to some wonderful constituents of mine in the 2024 Lilley Volunteers Awards. I recognised 31 incredible individuals, community groups and businesses who volunteer their time, skills and expertise for the benefit of our northside community. These volunteers are essential to the Lilley community, and their selfless contributions make all of our lives better. I would like to give a particular shout-out to those who received the Elaine Darling Lifetime Contribution to Volunteering Award. The recipients of this award each have made exemplary contributions to the community through their volunteer work for over 15 years. This award was presented to Joy Nielson, Leanne Eggins, Angela Flaherty,
