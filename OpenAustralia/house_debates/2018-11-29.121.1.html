       <p>
        As 2018 draws to a close, I report to the House on the Morrison government's commitments in Canning, and also on how we have worked to strengthen Australia's national security.
       </p>
       <p>
        2018 has been a huge year for our region. The Morrison government has delivered record funding for important infrastructure and services across the Peel region and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Hills
        </a>
        . In the May budget we delivered $253 million to extend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkin_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Tonkin Highway
        </a>
        south past Mundijong Road in Serpentine and Jarrahdale. This will attract more jobs and investment to our region and, importantly, it will mean people spend less time on dangerous, congested roads and more time with their families. We're also spending $183 million to build grade separations on the Tonkin Highway at the Hale Road,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool_Road_East" rel="nofollow">
         Welshpool Road East
        </a>
        and Kelvin Road intersections. Anyone who has travelled along the Tonkin Highway knows how frustrating the current stop-start arrangement of traffic lights can be. Thanks to this government, that problem will soon come to an end. We're also spending $241 million to extend the Armadale train line to Byford. This is big news. Byford is one of the fastest-growing local government areas in Australia. If you live locally, the train will provide easy access to job opportunities and educational opportunities in Perth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Down in Mandurah we delivered $2 million for the business case to build a Latham train station. This is sensible, long-awaited public transport infrastructure that has strong community support. I'm currently in discussions with the Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population about construction funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our growing region also needs more jobs. To encourage industry development and investment, we delivered $21.75 million for stage 1 of the Peel Business Park. This locally grown project is designed to make the Peel region an agricultural and export hub. This coalition government has also been mindful of the unique challenges faced by regional communities in electorates such as mine. As such, we've had a particular focus on improving regional services through programs such as the Building Better Regions Fund. I'm pleased to report that since 2016 this government has invested over $9 million for important projects in Dwellingup, Waroona, Pinjarra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dandalup" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Preston Beach
        </a>
        through the BBRF. One highlight is the expansion of aged-care services this program has funded at Bedingfield Park in Pinjarra.
       </p>
       <p>
        In parliament, my focus has been on keeping Australia safe and secure. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        has led the listing of new terrorist groups and strengthened the power of police and security agencies to hunt them down. Much of our time on the committee has been spent refining laws to fight the dangerously high levels of espionage and foreign interference in Australia. We have established the Critical Infrastructure Centre. This applies a strict national security test to any foreign investment into Australia's critical infrastructure, such as electricity, gas or water assets and, importantly, our ports. The Morrison government has blocked the sale of one of our major gas pipelines to a foreign country that is vulnerable to coercion by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese Communist Party
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Back in Canning, there are many important projects that I am working on in the new year. My priorities for 2019 include fighting for a better Peel Health Campus; funding for the Mandurah waterfront pool, which will transform the centre of Mandurah into the tourist hub that we all want it to be; and fighting for the Pinjarra heavy haulage deviation, which is critically important for the people of Pinjarra. Right now, there are 690 trucks driving through the Pinjarra town centre each and every day. The deviation will relieve that congestion and get the sound of Jake brakes out of the town centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Serpentine-Jarrahdale and Byford, I will further increase pressure on WA Labor to extend the Tonkin Highway, as so far they have done nothing with the money we have committed to the works. In the hills, I've jointed the fight for important local institutions, like the Roleystone-Karagullen cricket club and the Save Roleystone Theatre campaign. Together we have achieved a lot and together we can achieve much more in the future. I want to thank all the constituents, local governments and community organisations who have supported me as I have advocated here in Canberra on their behalf. It's been a privilege and an honour to serve you this year.
