       <p>
        I wish to talk about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        . A campus in my electorate, Nirimba campus, is an education precinct. It has two high schools and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        , and of course the university has been there for a number of years. Last year I learnt from the then Minister for Education, Science and Training,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Bishop
        </a>
        , that the university had proposed to withdraw from that campus. I have to give credit to my colleagues on the other side. In particular, the member for Parramatta, who is here, was part of a group who pulled together to fight to ensure that the university did remain. I called a number of meetings with the chancellor and the vice-chancellor and the then education minister and also took out a petition. The Labor candidate at the time criticised me for taking out that petition, but he has now taken out a petition himself, which he claims has helped. I congratulate both the mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kelly" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and also my other colleagues for fighting together. This is an opportunity to talk about the fact that we can work together to achieve a good outcome, but what is most important here is that the young people of my electorate now have the opportunity to continue or to begin a university education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week the vice-chancellor announced that the university will remain. They will be moving some diploma courses from their Westmead campus. I think that is a good move; it is a good start. I would certainly like to see the university look beyond diploma courses. Previously, there were only business courses available. With this move, there are more opportunities for students to, at least, start in a variety of different courses. This is a win for young people, particularly people who are already in high schools and TAFE on the campus in that precinct. It is a win also for young people in the norâ€™-west sector, in the electorate of Greenway and neighbouring electorates across Western Sydney to begin a university course. If they want to complete a diploma they can complete it on site, but it also gives an opportunity to students to decide whether they want to complete a full university degree and whether they will be able to complete one. I congratulate the university for this decision. It is a good step forward. I will be encouraging them to look at how they can provide further educational opportunities for the young people of Western Sydney.
