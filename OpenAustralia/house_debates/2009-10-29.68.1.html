         I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question is out of order. It is not in order for the shadow minister to verbal the Prime Minister in a question.

            I thank the honourable member for her question. The fact is that we are dealing with a very difficult issue. We are dealing with the Indonesia authorities to ensure the safe transfer of the passengers on the
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Viking" rel="nofollow">
              Oceanic Viking
             </a>
            </i>
            to Indonesian territory. That is what we are doing. In relation to that, we will continue to work with the Indonesia government pursuant to the agreement that was struck between the Prime Minister and the President some time ago. As we know and as the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, we are dealing with 78 human beings here. We will continue to ensure a humanitarian response to this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can confirm that the Prime Minister was correct in informing the House that this matter has not been canvassed by the government. The matter that was referred to in the question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not referred to by the government. I can say to the House that we will work patiently and calmly with the Indonesian authorities pursuant to the agreement that has been reached. While I am on my feet, I thank—and I am sure that all members of the House would like to do so—the crew on the
            <i>
             Oceanic Viking
            </i>
            for their good work. This is a very difficult situation that they are confronted with. The care that they are discharging and the concern that they are exhibiting for these passengers should be commended by this House. We will continue to work with the Indonesian authorities and resolve this matter to the satisfaction of the agreement reached between the two countries.
