       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge on behalf of the 18 local schools in Corangamite that they were allocated $1.75 million under the Commonwealth governmentâ€™s Investing in Our Schools program. As members on this side would be aware, the allocation of this money has given a number of smaller primary and secondary schools in the electorate the ability to upgrade some of their equipment, fix up their classrooms and carpets and other school facilities, and it has provided them with some new computers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This brings to a total of $3 million which has been allocated to those schools in Corangamite. I am personally delighted on behalf of those schools and those parent groups who have made application for this federal funding. I acknowledge Alvie Consolidated School, Bannockburn Primary School, Bellaire Primary School, Colac Specialist School, Elliminyt Primary School, Ocean Grove Primary School, Point Lonsdale Primary School, Rokewood Primary School and Wallington Primary School and a number of others that will enjoy the extra funding which has been directly allocated to those parent groups and school communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be visiting those schools during the break, and I am sure they will be very pleased to see me because of the way in which the federal government has funded them directly.
