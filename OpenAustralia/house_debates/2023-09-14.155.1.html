       <p>
        I rise to speak to a matter of public interest on the National Mental Health Commission. Established back in 2012, the commission is a vital public institution. It has provided federal government with unapologetic, independent advice on the state of the nation's mental health and wellbeing over the last decade. The last few years, with unprecedented natural disasters, the COVID pandemic and increasing cost-of-living pressures, have further highlighted the importance of mental health and wellbeing across Australia. For this reason, there has never been a more important time in our history to have a national mental health commission that is delivering for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In early April this year, I initiated an independent investigation into the National Mental Health Commission in response to allegations made public through the media. The allegations were of a serious and significant nature and canvassed a broad range of organisational and staff wellbeing matters. The investigation was lead by Adjunct Professor Debora Picone AO in collaboration with Adjunct Professor Karen Crawshaw PSM, and its intent was to consider whether matters raised in the media could be substantiated; to conduct a culture and capability review; to ensure the commission provides a safe work environment and has the capability to perform its role; and to conduct a full functional and efficiency review to ensure the commission can be financially sustainable moving forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the Adjunct Professors Picone and Crawshaw for their work in conducting the investigation, and particularly their care in working with the staff of the commission. I also want to thank the many staff who participated in the process and acknowledge their ongoing contribution to the work of the commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        I received the report from the reviewers on 31 July this year. Having taken some time to consider the report in detail, I am today tabling the final report in full as well as the associated functional and efficiency review final report conducted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EY" rel="nofollow">
         EY
        </a>
        . Maintaining confidence in the work of the commission is critical for its future. Over its 88 pages, the report explores the commission's current operating environment and takes into consideration accounts from staff and stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, the investigation determined that the commission's workforce, inclusive of its leadership, has been dedicated to the commission's work and mission. There was no substantiated evidence of maladministration or evidence of conduct that would substantiate a finding of bullying. The most significant findings impeding the functioning of the commission related to what the reviewers termed a 'very poor workplace culture', significant budget operating losses and a staffing profile operating above the agency's currently funded average staffing levels. Significantly, the reviewers found an organisation that had 'outgrown its existing systems, practices and capabilities'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report provides an important platform for reform of the commission, and outlines key areas requiring further consideration and action. Over the coming months, I will work with government colleagues, the commission and key stakeholders to further consider the recommendations and bring advice to government on resetting the commission's role and strengthening it. I have tasked the Department of Health and Aged Care to oversee this work.
       </p>
       <p>
        My immediate priority is ensuring we position the commission for the future, providing staff with stability and a clear path forward. The department will work with the commission to develop a plan for addressing the recommendations in the report and to support the wellbeing of staff. I have also asked Dr Ruth Vine to provide advice to me as a special adviser on the development of reforms, continuing to work with the sector.
       </p>

        On 8 September 2023, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">

        of the National Mental Health Commission, Ms Christine Morgan, wrote to me offering her resignation, advising that she considers it is in the best interests of the commission for a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        to undertake the work identified by the report. I have accepted Ms Morgan's resignation, and I want to thank her for her service as CEO of the commission. I also thank Dr Ruth Vine for her stewardship of the commission during the investigation process. I am committed to ensuring the commission delivers on its important role in transparency, accountability and monitoring of government investment and the impact on mental health and suicide prevention. The Australian government is committed to a National Mental Health Commission that is focused on improving the mental health and suicide prevention system, so all Australians have confidence in the services that they choose and use.
