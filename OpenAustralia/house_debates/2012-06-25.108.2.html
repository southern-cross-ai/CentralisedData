        , I present the committee's report 3/2012:
        <i>
         Referrals made 2011 to March
        </i>
        <i>
         2012
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2012, which addresses referrals made between November 2011 and March 2012. This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $302.2 million. In each case the committee recommends the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first inquiry examined
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Australia
        </a>
        's proposal for the development of housing for defence families at Rasmussen in Townsville, Queensland. The key objectives of the project are to ensure that the proportion of defence families residing in private rental accommodation in the Townsville area remains under the target of 15 per cent and to maintain the housing stock in Townsville at acceptable levels. Defence Housing Australia plans to develop 1,180 residential allotments and one medium-density site in 30 stages on a site of approximately 99 hectares. Defence Housing Australia then intends to construct 401 dwellings to supply housing for defence personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key issues for this proposal concerns the potential for large flood events to impact on the Rasmussen site. Defence Housing Australia stated that the proposed development will be above the one-in-100-year flood event level. The committee pursued this issue, suggesting that a one-in-100-year flood may not be the worst flood event that could occur, as recent flood events around the nation have shown. In particular, my deputy on the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Mallee, pursued this issue. The committee accepts that Defence Housing Australia is developing and building on the Rasmussen site within normal guidelines and according to advice provided by local and state government agencies regarding the potential for flooding. I move to speak to the second inquiry of this report. The Department of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , Arts and Sport seeks approval for a project that will increase bulk fuel storage capacity and integrate and co-locate fuel storage on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Christmas Island has a high dependency on fuel to maintain essential services and operations owing to its isolated location. Diesel is used primarily in the generation of electricity; aviation fuel is essential for commercial and government aviation operations; and unleaded petrol is used for private, commercial and government vehicles. Increased activity, including sea, land and air transport components, has particularly increased demand for diesel and aviation fuel. The ability to maintain essential services and operations on the island is limited by the current capacity of the fuel storage infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal describes several measures that will increase fuel storage capacity and co-location of facilities. However, a key element in the proposal, and the key concern for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Christmas Island
        </a>
        is the proposed location of the service station. There are four outcomes proposed for the service station, each with key advantages and disadvantages. The shire does not entirely agree with the department's proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department reassured the committee that full and open consultation would be undertaken during the detailed design phase of the project. The committee is relying on the department, which has overall responsibility for Christmas Island, to make the best-informed decision concerning the location of the service station. The committee is confident that the department, in making that decision, will do all it can to incorporate the community's views and ameliorate any negative impacts associated with the selected location.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third inquiry in this report examined the proposed fit-out of Commonwealth parliamentary offices at 1 Bligh Street in Sydney. The Sydney
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPO" rel="nofollow">
         CPO
        </a>
        , currently located at 70 Phillip Street, provides office and meeting facilities for the Prime Minister, cabinet, ministers, office holders and visiting senators and members. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_and_Deregulation" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance and Deregulation
        </a>
        stated that the 70 Phillip Street premises can be described as inadequate and no longer fit for purpose, with the key areas of concern being deficiencies in security, functionality, architecture and flexibility. Refurbishment of 70 Phillip Street has not been pursued as an option as there are several fundamental issues with the building that cannot be remedied through renovation alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to lease three levels of the new building at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The department is confident that it will achieve a far better CPO facility through contemporary design, shared facilities and the intelligent use of a superior building.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new premises will also feature dedicated media facilities, including a live broadcast link capacity, something that has not been possible at 70 Phillip Street. One of the questions that the committee asked and was seeking reassurance about was on the telephone usage and the communications also at parking level within the planned facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is satisfied that the Department of Finance and Deregulation has fully considered all feasible options for the establishment of new Commonwealth parliamentary offices in Sydney, and that the selected option is a practical, long-term solution that represents value for money for the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries, and the committee secretariat.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the report to the House.
