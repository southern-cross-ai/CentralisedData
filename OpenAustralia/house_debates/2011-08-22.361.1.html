       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Connie Fierravanti-Wells, shadow minister for ageing and mental health, for visiting my local community earlier this month. The senator and I went to local aged-care facilities, and we had a very honest, open and often robust discussion about the challenges facing aged care into our future. As policymakers in this place I think it is important that we rise to meet what will inevitably be a very significant challenge for our nation with the ageing of the population.
       </p>
       <p>
        The senator and I then held yet another open forum with over 40 local service providers in the mental health area. Once again we had a very robust discussion about the challenges facing mental health service provision in my local community and across the nation. It was made evident that these challenges are roadblocks to all facets of our society, be they employment or social inclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The senator and I engaged in the discussion about how we meet these challenges. It was made evident that locally, with nearly twice the average rate of suicide, we need 24-hour care, we need acute and subacute care and, in short, we need an Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre. This is something that was committed to by me and the coalition at the last federal election and something which we remain committed to. It is something which I am fighting for for my local community so that we can rise and meet the significant challenges as a society.
