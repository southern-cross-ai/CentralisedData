       <p>
        I would like to talk about a very important matter to the people of the electorate of Greenway, and particularly the people of the Hawkesbury, and that is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racecourse_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Racecourse Road
        </a>
        . The northern end of Racecourse Road presently includes the following regional facilities: the Hawkesbury Race Club, the Hawkesbury showground, Clarendon railway station, a restaurant and tavern and of course the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        base.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to normal activities, the race club and the showground often promote special eventsâ€”car shows and so on. Many patrons avoid the most direct route, which is a 1.7-kilometre unsealed section via Racecourse Road, due to the condition of the gravel road and are forced to travel an additional seven to eight kilometres. This increases traffic through very populated areas, particularly Richmond and Windsor, and the sealing of this road will encourage people to use it. Of course, as many people would appreciate, owners of valuable racehorses want to avoid such risks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Racecourse Road also provides a vital link to regional transport, markets, employment and many other amenities. There are many special activities around the racetrack, such as horse trainers, stables and agistment. The sealing of Racecourse Road will yield the following benefits: significantly reduced transportation costs by reducing the trip; reduced vehicle operation costs, wear and tear; a saving of 20 minutes of travelling time; and potential productivity improvements due to time saved.

        I had the privilege of meeting with key stakeholders in February this year. Those key stakeholders included: members of the Hawkesbury District Agricultural Association, including Mary Aveyard and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Colin Mitchell
        </a>
        ; and members of the Hawkesbury Race Club, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fletcher" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Fletcher
        </a>
        . I also had the privilege of meeting with the mayor. At that meeting we discussed the critical need for funding for this road. The council applied for funding through the AusLink Strategic Regional Program, and I was pleased last year to be able to announce under this federal program $723,000 to seal this significant road for the local area. I am absolutely committed to working for the people of Greenway and securing safety and funding for their key road infrastructure.
