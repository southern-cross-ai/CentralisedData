        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister inform the House of the savings that have been passed onto families and businesses in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        since the government scrapped the world's biggest carbon tax? Minister, are there any threats to these savings?

         I want to thank the member for Swan who is a great champion of the environment. Along with the member for Hasluck, he was the co-architect of the Swan-Canning River Recovery Plan—a million dollar plan—part of the coastal rivers recovery plan with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">

         and Tuggerah Lakes; real things to do to clean up our environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the member for Swan is not just a champion of the environment; he is also a champion of lower costs for families. The member for Swan voted to repeal the carbon tax; unlike his neighbour, the member for Perth, who voted to keep the carbon tax. The member for Swan voted for lower electricity prices; unlike the member for Perth who voted for higher electricity prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than that, the member for Swan voted for a saving of $319 million in electricity prices for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

           It is hard, isn't it? A three-second silence and she has gone troppo. The member for Swan voted for lower rates in

           ; the member Perth voted for higher rates. And, most recently, in the last few days the member for Swan voted for lower public transport costs, and just last week we saw Transperth announce fares would be reduced from November 1 following the repeal of the carbon tax.
          </p>

          <p>
           He will not call it a carbon tax, but the answer is very simple: if it looks like a carbon tax, if it hurts like a carbon tax and if it raises electricity prices like a carbon tax, it is a carbon tax. You know what? He will not call it a carbon tax between now and the election, but we know what it is. You know what it is, and the Australian people know that you want to bring it back. We are for lower electricity prices; you are for higher electricity prices, and that is all that matters.
