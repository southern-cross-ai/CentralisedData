       <p>
        The Labor budget that was just handed down starts the repair work of our Medicare and primary health system. The primary health and Medicare system was really neglected in the former government's reign, so I'm really pleased that in this first budget we are taking steps to repair our primary healthcare system. The big issues that many people in my electorate raise on a regular basis include access to see a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        , access to the local hospital, access to cheaper medicines and access to the right health care when they need it. I am so pleased to communicate with my electorate the big investments Labor is making to strengthen Medicare and get primary health care back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've already started delivering our Strengthening Medicare Taskforce. This task force is a diverse group of health experts and consumer representatives who will provide advice to help the government fix our healthcare system. The goals of the task force are to improve patient access to general practice, including after-hours care; to improve patient access to nursing and allied health services; to increase affordability; to have better management of complex cases; and to decrease the pressure on our hospital system. The work of the task force will be implemented through a $750 million investment to deliver the highest priority reforms to Medicare. This has been welcomed by people in my electorate, who have been crying out for some action to strengthen Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the big commitments in this budget was an urgent care clinic for the southern suburbs of Adelaide—something very much needed by so many people in my electorate. It's really a commonsense idea. If you don't need to go to a tertiary hospital, where can you go to get broken bones mended and other care you might not otherwise be able to access from a GP?
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there was the $200 million for the expansion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Medical Centre
        </a>
        —the medical centre in which I was born. This is a good investment for our local community. It will be matched by $200 million from the state government. It's a very critical institution that desperately needs this investment, which will go to servicing so many people in my electorate. The new investment will include money for 136 extra beds and expansion of the intensive care unit, new modern operating theatres, upgraded imaging technology and a brand-new eye-surgery clinic.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is investing in healthcare, and it will benefit my community.
