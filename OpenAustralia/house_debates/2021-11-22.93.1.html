        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister claims he changed his mind on electric vehicles because of 'massive changes to technology since 2019'. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Electric Vehicle Council says he has no idea what the Prime Minister is talking about. Why did the Prime Minister make this claim when it simply isn't true?

         If the opposition spokesman doesn't think there have been advances in technology since 2019, then he's clearly not keeping up to pace. What I do know is our government is not going to put up the pressure on petrol prices by changing emissions standards on fuels. We're not going to do that. It's important that the Labor Party come clean on that, otherwise that's just another sneaky tacticâ€”

             In particular, where I was on that day at Toyota, the advance in technologies that has occurred with hydrogen powered vehicles, particularly consumer vehicles, and in heavy industry in heavy vehicles has come forward in leaps and bounds. Now, the Leader of the Opposition says hydrogen vehicles are not
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV" rel="nofollow">
              EV
             </a>
             . I just heard him say it. What does he think hydrogen does in an electric vehicle? It converts it into electricity which drives the battery. That's what an electric vehicle is. It can be powered by a charger. It can be powered by hydrogen. The Leader of the Opposition has no clue what he's talking about when it comes to these vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
             This might come as a bit of a shock to the Leader of the Opposition, but, in Australia, there are very large distances over which Australians travel, and, if he thinks you can have charging stations along the

              Outback Way
             </a>
             , good luck to him! But what I know from talking to the transport industry, what I know from talking to the vehicle manufacturers and people like Dr Alan Finkel is that here, in Australia, hydrogen powered electric vehicles is an Australian solution. It's a solution for Australian transport. Now, that might not go down so well in the cafes of Marrickville. That might not go down so well when he's spinning the discs there pretending to be a

                 I know that there are electric vehicles that you use in inner suburban areas, and that's very important. That's fine when people want to make those choices. We're not going to force people to buy those cars by putting up petrol prices by changing the fuel emissions standards, which is nothing more than a sneaky tax on petrol. We're not going to do that. We will ensure that we're supporting it, through the incentives and the initiatives we're putting in place. But one of the things we're particularly focusing on is hydrogen powered electric vehicles, because those are the things that can transport heavy vehicles and consumer vehicles over long distances, which is what Australia needs. Our approach is following the Australian way. The Leader of the Opposition might want to just go down the path of heavily populated cities in Europe and think that's the solution for Australia.
