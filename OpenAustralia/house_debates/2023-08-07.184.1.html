        Today I rise to honour the life of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        community stalwart, Mr George O'Sign, who passed away last week aged 85. Born in Launceston, George grew up on a farm in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Head" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and attended school in George Town before he undertook an apprenticeship, working for a few local builders and for Comalco before spending three decades at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">
         George Town Council
        </a>
        as a building inspector, building surveyor and health inspector. In fact, all around George Town, George has left his legacy across the area, with many buildings, including houses, having been built or inspected by him. His son Colin said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I used to take him in the car, and he'd say, 'I built that one' … just about every house in George Town they had a crack at when he was a builder.'
       </p>
       <p>
        After retiring in 2007, he was elected top of the poll in the 2009 local council election, the same year I was first elected to the council. I always found him to be very thoughtful and sincere and a great councillor who was very passionate about his local community. George eventually stepped away as a councillor following the death of his beloved wife, Pauline, after 54 years of marriage. He's survived by three sons, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, all of whom I know brought him so much joy. I particularly love the comment from Colin, who reflected on having George as his father:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He did everything for us and tried to give us more than he ever had. You couldn't ask for a more genuine man—he was a great family man.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vale, George O'Sign.
