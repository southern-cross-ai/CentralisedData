         <p>
          Yesterday, the member for Swan asked me a question in parliament concerning Ms Brenda Hendricks, who had raised issues about her dealings with Centrelink. In responding to the member’s question I do not want to cause any undue stress to Ms Hendricks herself. However, it is important that I place on the record the advice I have received in relation to this matter.
         </p>
         <p>
          We believe Ms Hendricks contacted Centrelink for the first time on 17 February. She attended a Centrelink interview on 27 February, during which she provided a medical certificate. As a result of the interview and information on the medical certificate Ms Hendricks was granted, on that same day,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newstart_Allowance" rel="nofollow">
           Newstart Allowance
          </a>
          (Incapacitated). Ms Hendricks was not required to look for work. Two more medical certificates were provided to Centrelink in April 2006. The three medical certificates were completed by three different doctors and contained completely contradictory advice about Ms Hendricks’s prognosis. In line with normal processes, the lodgement of the third medical certificate prompted a referral for a work capacity assessment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The third medical certificate indicated that Ms Hendricks’s condition was temporary. The work capacity assessment was returned to Centrelink on 15 May indicating Ms Hendricks was correctly receiving Newstart Allowance (Incapacitated). On 26 May contact from a social worker at the Charles Gardiner Hospital alerted Centrelink staff to the seriousness of Ms Hendricks’s medical condition. Centrelink staff went to the hospital to collect a completed claim for disability support pension and a treating doctor’s report. This treating doctor’s report provided new information and stated the significant nature of Ms Hendricks illness. Centrelink assessed the claim immediately and disability support pension was granted on that same day. Therefore, Ms Hendricks has been receiving the disability support pension since 26 May.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am advised that Ms Hendricks contacted my office for the first time by email last Thursday. She received an acknowledgement from my department the next day advising that her email had been referred for investigation. I am also advised that the member for Swan never contacted Centrelink, never contacted his designated local liaison officer and never contacted my office before raising this sensitive matter in the parliament. This matter is very serious. I think everyone here should wish Ms Hendricks a speedy recovery from a serious illness.
