       <p>
        This government lie continuously to 2.6 million Australian pensioners. They told pensioners there would be no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to Medicare and they told them that robodebt was entirely legal. We know that this Prime Minister says one thing and does another. And when it comes to the cashless pension card, he has already said that the pension is a 'welfare payment'. Then his minister admitted on Channel 7, 'We are seeking to put all income onto a universal platform—the cashless debit card'. This is a universal platform, a nationwide expansion, and there is broader application for the entire community.

        Already in parts of WA, people on pensions like the disability pension are being forced onto the cashless pension card. People in my electorate are very concerned about this government's legislative plans. They put legislation up to do this. Karen from Bayswater says that she likes to buy a wine or two and Kathy from Bayswater says she likes to support local businesses. Matt from

        That's what this government wants to do: end the flutter and end any fun for pensioners—lock up their pension, quarantine their payments and take away their dignity. It's disgraceful!
