       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to Australia's Vietnam Veterans in the lead-up to Vietnam Veteran's Day on 18 August. This Saturday I will join thousands of Australians across the nation who will attend a memorial service to remember those who fought in one of this country's most unpopular wars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's military involvement in the Vietnam War was the longest in duration of any other war in our country's history. My father, Reg Matheson, was one of the 60,000 Australian soldiers deployed to Vietnam between May 1962 and April 1975. Sadly, 521 men died as a result of this war and more than 3,000 were wounded.
       </p>

         The Vietnam War
        </a>
        caused one of the greatest anti-war movements in Australia's history and, sadly, our soldiers met a hostile reception on their return home. I pray that no Australian soldier ever has to return home from war to such little support from their country. I know that my dad experienced the horrors of war in Vietnam and those memories remain with him today. That is why every year I attend a Vietnam Veteran's Day service and memorial dinner in Macarthur to pay my respects to those soldiers who fought so gallantly and suffered with very little support for many years after they returned home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vietnam Veterans Association Macarthur Branch are committed to the ongoing support of our local veterans and their families. It is with great pride that I stand here today to thank them for their dedication and commitment to these men who deserve all the help and support we can give them. I hope that everyone in this place has the opportunity to attend a Vietnam Veteran's Day service this weekend to remember those who fought in one of the most horrific wars in Australia's history.
