        Far North Queenslanders have answered the call and rolled up their sleeves in record numbers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. They know the vaccine is the best defence to protect themselves, their families, their loved ones and their communities from COVID-19. They also know that the 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination target is the catalyst for learning to live with the virus, kick-starting their tourism sector and getting back to living their lives.

        More than 52 per cent of people living in the

        The vaccine rollout is continuing in earnest throughout the cape. This week residents living in Weipa, Napranum and Mapoon will have access to their first Pfizer dose, while residence in Bamaga will start receiving their second. Next week, residents in Coen, Weipa, Kowanyama and Lockhart will start receiving their second dose. The uptake in these communities is very strong, and it shows that Far North Queenslanders are doing their bit to ensure vaccine targets are being met.
