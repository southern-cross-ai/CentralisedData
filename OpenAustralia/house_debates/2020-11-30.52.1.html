        I was recently privileged to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark's" rel="nofollow">
         St Mark's
        </a>
        Catholic Primary School at Inala and speak about government to a fantastic grade 6 cohort. Bright and as excited as always, students at St Mark's had the opportunity not only to hear how the government works but also to ask tough questions of their local federal member. St Mark's is a vibrant learning community within the St Mark's parish that is founded on the values of respect, relationships and responsibilities. They gave me a squeezy stress ball—which has had great use!—with that slogan on it. The Oxley electorate Parliamentary School Program allows me to outreach about all of the government's services and inspire young Australians who may one day be leaders sitting in this place. I take a moment to thank members of our local Forest Lake Men's Shed who created a replica dispatch box and mace to help teach students about the history and processes in parliament.

        Schools have had a different year this year, and I know that many Queensland schools and Australian schools were unable to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        in Canberra this year, which gives an appreciation of the difficulty of the school year through remote learning and teaching, I want to take a moment to thank all of our teachers, teachers aides, support staff and parents who have worked so hard this year. I believe it's important that, as leaders, we connect with the next generation of our community as they learn and navigate their way through learning. We are proud of all of our educators and we salute you all.
