        I want the name Wilson Neuendorf recorded in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        so that it remains in perpetuity within this place. Wilson Neuendorf is an amazing Australian who lives in the community of Kalbar. He's the president of the Kalbar Progress Association. This year, he was the Australia Day Award
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim
        </a>
        recipient of the Citizen of the Year Award, Senior. And, more recently, he was Rotary's Felix Grayson memorial inaugural Community Leadership Award recipient. Kalbar is a better place to live because of Wilson Neuendorf and the work he has done over many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kalbar is a small community of 1,100 people, and the biggest footprint in the community is the showgrounds. Kalbar sits within the Scenic Rim. For those Australians that may not have heard of the Scenic Rim, it starts on the

        hinterland—beautiful rainforest—comes down into rich farmland and opens up into beautiful big scenic locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, the Scenic Rim has earned the auspicious title of the No. 1 place in Australia to visit and is amongst the top 10 in the world, according to

       <p>
        Mr Speaker, if you come to the Scenic Rim and go to the community of Kalbar, I hope you get the opportunity to meet Wilson Neuendorf, because he will take you down and introduce you to the owners of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Chapel" rel="nofollow">
         White Chapel
        </a>
        , which was voted the best wedding venue in the state. Imagine—I'm trying to paint a picture—you've got the best wedding venue in the state, ousting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Island" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; it's the No. 1 place in Australia to visit, and, according to Lonely Planet, is in the top 10 places to visit in the world. Come and visit Kalbar. Come and visit the Scenic Rim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wilson has grown vegetables all his life and he's a pork producer, so he's at the heart of Eat Local Week, where we showcase the beautiful produce, the beautiful food. We get some of the state's best chefs to come to the region, we celebrate food, we celebrate the region, and we celebrate our diversity. Today it gives me great pride to get to my feet and celebrate the great Australians who make this happen. Wilson Neuendorf, I commend you.
