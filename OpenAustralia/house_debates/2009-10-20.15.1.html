        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to today’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank

        board minutes on the decision of 6 October to raise interest rates. The minutes state:

       <p class="italic">
        … the balance of risks was now such that the current very expansionary setting of policy was no longer necessary, and possibly imprudent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Isn’t it the case, Treasurer, that the current very expansionary setting of fiscal policy is also no longer necessary, and possibly imprudent?

         Well, talk about verballing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank

         board and their minutes! There they go again. They cannot stand the fact that the stimulus was successful. They cannot stand the fact that the stewardship of this government during a period of grave threat to this country was successful. They simply cannot stand it so they will stretch any fact. They will distort any quote from anybody anytime to completely and inaccurately portray the position of both the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the minutes.

                  and the governor—in their minutes today—are saying nothing different from what they have consistently said for a long period of time, and that is that interest rates, at their 50-year emergency lows, could not stay there forever. Those opposite have been running around the country trying to pretend that somehow they could and that there would not be a withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus by the Reserve Bank at any time in the future. They hate the fact that our economy has begun to grow. They simply dislike that because the one thing that they wanted, when they came into this parliament in February this year and voted against our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, was higher unemployment and they wanted it for base political purposes. They therefore resent the fact that our fiscal stimulus, working hand in glove with the monetary policy stimulus from the Reserve Bank, has produced one of the most outstanding results in the world. That is what they resent, and therefore they then go on to perpetrate a fiction that there is somehow some conflict between the Reserve Bank governor and the board and their minutes with government policy. There is nothing in these minutes that says anything other than the Reserve Bank is beginning to unwind monetary policy stimulus because the economy is beginning to grow. It is that simple. Of course fiscal policy and monetary policy are both working together. And the other thing that they refuse to admit is the fact that fiscal policy reached its peak in June this year and it will subtract from growth in every quarter of next year. But the reason they will not admit that is that they have got a policy of withdrawing stimulus—

With due respect to you, Mr Speaker, as you well know a member who feels that they have been treated offensively has the right to ask for a withdrawal. The Treasurer on four occasions before today has accused us of voting a certain way in this House when the opposite is true. Now today he is accusing the Leader of the Opposition of verballing the

                            minutes. He is therefore a serial offender. I would ask you to ask him to withdraw for the good of the House.

                              Order! One of the standards might be to listen to the standing orders and not interject on everything and every matter. I just remind the member for Bowman of that. Regrettably, this is a discourse that is characteristic of this place where people can place greater emphasis on what might be considered as debating points and the like. We have already had in this question time another shadow minister being accused of verballing. If that was the case, then it would have been raised at that point in time. I am suggesting that the other forms of the House are the best way that this might be handled. On the point that has been raised further by the Manager of Opposition Business about where there is a necessity to repeatedly make personal explanations, this again is something that has occurred over a number of parliaments.

                                  especially on the chair, no matter what people might think of the occupant, might not be of assistance.

The Treasurer has the call and he will, I hope, conclude his answer.

                                   board minutes. I would like to quote from those minutes to conclude my answer, Mr Speaker. The board observes that stimulus has already peaked and is tapering away, and it says this:

                                   growth was likely to have peaked in the June quarter and was now gradually declining.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   This should be read in the context of statements that the Reserve Bank governor gave when he attended the Senate inquiry last month. He was talking about the inbuilt withdrawal of the stimulus when he had this to say:
                                  </p>

                                   Such an outcome would mean that fiscal and monetary policy would be acting broadly consistently, as they did when they were moved in the expansionary direction when the economy was slowing.
                                  </p>
