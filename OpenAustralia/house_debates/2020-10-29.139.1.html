        One aspect of this job I really enjoy is when I get to travel around my electorate of Longman and see firsthand the positive changes we are making in the community. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is a good example of this. The Morrison government has allocated around $20.6 million to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        Regional Council under this program. The first round of funding announced earlier this year was just over $5 million and the second round of just over $15 million was announced in the recent federal budget. The investment will get shovels in the ground on local construction projects that are important for maintaining jobs and boosting the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four projects in my electorate have already been approved under this program. Summerfields Drive Park in Caboolture will get a significant overhaul under this program, including a new shelter, barbecue and picnic facilities, new shade trees and landscaping as well as a play area for the kids. This investment will encourage more families to get outside and spend quality time together and will help increase the sense of community that we have in Longman. Bigmor Drive in Elimbah will get a 2.4 kilometre concrete footpath that will make it safer for pedestrians to get where they're going and easier for mums with prams and people with mobility issues who use that footpath. Two new fauna crossings and new wildlife signage will be installed at Woorim on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">

        . This infrastructure will help keep local wildlife off busy roads and inform road users to take more care in those areas. Finally, Bob Brock Park in Dakabin will get new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED" rel="nofollow">

        sport lighting, which will help the North Pine Sports Club meet the growing demand on their facilities. These projects are all about federal and local governments working together for the community. They support local jobs and boost economic growth in the electorate as well as provide tangible benefits to the local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is certainly not the only way we are helping support local councils to deliver local projects.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will also receive around $5 million from the Roads to Recovery Program to help them maintain and upgrade local roads. The council can choose the local road projects based on local priorities. Moreton Bay council will also receive more than $17 million through the Financial Assistance Grant program, helping it deliver infrastructure, health, recreation, environmental and employment projects. Again, the council can spend this funding based on local priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every single job we support makes a huge difference in our local community as we build our way out of the pandemic. That is why we have moved quickly to approve funding for these programs so shovel-ready projects can get moving. Initiatives such as these that support local governments to deliver priority projects reinforce the federal government's commitment to job creation and improve the lives of all Australians.
