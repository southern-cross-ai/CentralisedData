        My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. As the member representing the garrison city of Townsville, I ask: would the minister inform the House of recent rotations of our forces in Iraq? Would the minister also update the House about—

          This is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister inform the House of recent rotations of our forces in Iraq? Would the minister also update the House about the work of our Defence Force and Australia’s contribution to security and democracy in Iraq?

           I thank the member for Herbert very much for his question and, more importantly, a very deep conviction about and commitment to the Defence community of Townsville. Just after lunchtime today, about 110 Australian soldiers returned to Australia. They were welcomed by the Chief of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who passed on to them my admiration on behalf of the government and the member for Barton’s on behalf of the opposition. They were led by Major Kyle Tyrrell. These men and women have returned from the security detachment in Baghdad.
          </p>
          <p>
           Major Tyrrell is one of five Australian soldiers who will, in returning, be introduced to their newborn babies, born during the deployment. These young soldiers undertook 80 operations in the streets of Baghdad. They are not only soldiers; they are required to be diplomats, aid workers and teachers and to exercise judgement in extremely difficult circumstances on the streets of Baghdad with their
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASLAV" rel="nofollow">
            ASLAV
           </a>
           s every single day that they have been there. It was of course last month that this security detachment sustained the rocket attack which injured four of our soldiers. I am very pleased to say, having spoken several days ago to Corporal Sarah Webster, that she is recovering very well in Townsville.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our Defence Force men and women voluntarily join the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Army

           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Air Force
           </a>
           and Navy, but their families in many cases basically are involved in a different way. On behalf of the government I particularly pay tribute to the families who supported these men and women during their deployment. The normal issues that are involved in relationships and households are compounded greatly when people are away, and I especially thank them. I was in Baghdad only two weeks ago—in fact, two weeks today, I had the privilege of being able to speak to the soldiers of the security detachment about the job that they have done on our behalf. Amongst the small group of journalists who attended with me was the Channel 7 personality
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koch" rel="nofollow">
            David Koch
           </a>
           . In speaking of the security detachment upon his return he said: ‘Those security guys in the security detachment, they do an extraordinary, extraordinary job. You come away absolutely inspired by our men and women.’
          </p>
          <p>
           During that visit I also had the opportunity to meet with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Iraq" rel="nofollow">
            Prime Minister of Iraq
           </a>
           , Nuri al-Maliki. During that meeting, in relation to Australia’s support for Iraq, he said that his country was particularly grateful for Australia’s support and pleased that Iraq has reached a stage where security responsibility could be transferred in some areas of Iraq. Establishing democracy, he said, would take time. Despite scenes of blood and terror, Iraqis covet their newly found political and economic freedoms. I say to all Australians, and in particular I say to the opposition, who do not support what Australia is doing along with other countries to support the Iraqi people themselves: these people have no less a right to freedoms than Australians,

           or anybody else. On returning to Australia the security detachment and our soldiers can be very proud of what they have done on behalf of our country—
