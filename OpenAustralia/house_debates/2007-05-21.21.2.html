       <p>
        I rise this afternoon to congratulate Northern Brass on its recent win of the intermediate section of the 2007 National Band Championships. This pre-eminent achievement adds to Northern Brass’s growing list of awards, proving it to be full of more than just hot air. Northern Brass has practised for fewer than two years and has competed three times, winning an award each time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Northern Brass is one of three bands that form Darebin City Brass, which is generously supported by the Darebin City Council. Since 1934, generations of Batman locals have played in the community bands. The current president, Peter Caldwell, is the longest serving member—41 years—and the Junior Band conductor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Kelly
        </a>
        , was appropriately awarded 2007 Darebin City Citizen of the Year. Together they have maintained the bands’ historically strong community involvement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the early days of the band, it has been a blast of fresh air and has attracted national attention. In 1953, it was one of the first Australian bands recorded on a long-play record. In 1986, Darebin City Brass was farewelled by the then member for Wills, Prime Minister Bob Hawke, to compete in the New Zealand Band Championships, where it placed fourth. I wish Darebin City Brass the greatest of successes for the future and in its next major event, which is to perform at the very same New Zealand Band Championships. It is doing a wonderful job, especially for our local people.
