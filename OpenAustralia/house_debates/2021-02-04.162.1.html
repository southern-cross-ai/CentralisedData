        Our nation owes an enormous debt of gratitude to Senior Constable Kelly Foster. I make this statement in our parliament today to ensure that her name, her dedication to duty, and her extraordinary service above self are remembered forever. Kelly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Foster" rel="nofollow">
         Ann Foster
        </a>
        unexpectedly and tragically lost her life while trying desperately and valiantly to save the life of another while canyoning in the Wollangambe Canyon at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Wilson
        </a>
        on 2 January 2021. It was a tragedy that shook our communities and our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Kelly Foster, we lost a true Australian hero that day. Kelly was awarded the National Police Service Medal, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         National Medal
        </a>
        , the New South Wales Police Medal and a Commissioner's Unit Citation in recognition of her involvement in the Lindt Cafe siege. We all remember those scenes in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place" rel="nofollow">
         Martin Place
        </a>
        and the work of our brave police and emergency services officers. Kelly worked as an intelligence analyst in the State Crime Command Real Time Intelligence Response Team, supporting the Property Crime Squad and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Abuse
        </a>
        and Sex Crime Squad and the Major Incidents Intelligence Cell. This involved 24/7 real-time tactical and operational support to frontline police who were responding to the most serious incidents. She received all of this in just a decade of policing. It is little wonder that she was awarded the Commissioner's Sesquicentenary 150 years in Policing Citation four years into her career. Her service record contains myriad complimentary remarks from the wider community in appreciation of her work. It is a record of service in the finest traditions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In May 2020, Kelly took the opportunity to continue her policing career in Lithgow. She would often comment that it was an honour to serve the Lithgow community and she relished the opportunity to return to operational policing. Her colleagues speak of how profoundly she cared for others and how much they respected her and enjoyed working with her. Kelly's recent funeral in Lithgow was a deeply moving farewell that told the story of a remarkable Australian woman. Kelly will forever be remembered for her dedication, professionalism, compassion, love and extraordinary courage.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian parliament, I extend my heartfelt condolences to her family—her partner, Gavin; her mother and father, Marilyn and Terry; her sister, Lee; and her brother, David—and to her extended family, friends and colleagues. We are very grateful for Kelly's service to our region, our state and our country. Whenever any of us needs any inspiration to do better, to go further or to do greater deeds, all we have to do is think of Kelly Foster. She will never be forgotten.

         I thank the member for Calare. I'm sure all members of the House would share the sentiments you have just conveyed to the parliament today.
