        [by video link] The unfolding humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is devastating. The images played into our lounge rooms or on our newsfeeds are heartbreaking: desperate Afghanis clambering onto the undercarriages of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Army planes; parents passing young children over barbed wire at the airport; families and individuals in distress and in fear of their lives because of their involvement in Western forces or their support for women's rights and their belief in advocacy for genuine democracy. You can't watch these scenes and not be moved and compelled to action. Like many of my parliamentary colleagues, I've been inundated with emails and messages from local residents expressing their concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those of you wondering what you can do to help, I encourage you to reach out to one of the many aid organisations that are providing assistance to the people of Afghanistan. There are a range of agencies focusing on various groups, and it's easy to make donations or lend your support.
       </p>
       <p>
        And to our young veterans: please, know that we remain as proud of you as ever, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people's lives who are better off because of your service. Again, reach out to one of the support groups:

        . To all these young men and women: you are not alone. We thank you profoundly for your service and we commit ourselves to supporting you, now more than ever.

         In this last week, we' ve seen tragic scenes in Afghanistan, and the people of that country now face the uncertainty of Taliban rule. My thoughts and prayers are with them at this time. I wish to honour all ADF members, t hose who served in Afghanistan , and the families of the 41 Australian lives lost in this conflict. In particular, I wish to honour the over 2,500 veterans in Moncrieff and two individuals from my electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lieutenant Colonel Garth Callender served for 25 years , with distinction in combat, intelligence, training and strategic roles. He's the author of
         <i>
          After the Blast
         </i>
         , which chronicles his military deployment and recovery from the attack in Baghdad in 2004. He now chairs the Bravery Trust for veter ans who face financial hardship resulting from injury or illness sustained during their service. He continues to serve Australians with distinction. My thoughts are with Garth , his lovely wife , Crystal , and his children.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make special mention of Jess e Bird , an awarded rifleman from 1
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
          RAR
         </a>
         , who served from 2007, fought in Afghanistan and , after his return home in 2010 , tragically took his own life. I posthumously honour Jesse and pay my respect s to his family. Jesse's mum , Karen Bird , a constituent and now friend of mine , has worked tirelessly to ensure Jesse and many like h im will rightly be remembered at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         , with a sculpture in recognition of those who experienced and witnessed the traum as that can result from military service. I thank Garth Callender and Jesse and Karen Bird for their service to our nation.
