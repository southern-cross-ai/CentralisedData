       <p>
        on indulgence—I simply want to advise the House that I will not be contesting the next election—and I do point out that Bernadette's sitting up there to make sure I don't recant on this decision! I came here at the Werriwa by-election in 2005, and I've had the privilege of serving this place now for the past 16 years. I transferred to the seat of Fowler in 2010, which was a bit of an eye opener, because it is the most multicultural seat in the whole country, which didn't reflect my background, which was always a bit odd to me, as another middle-aged white guy, being dropped into a community like that. But I must say, the people of Fowler were very, very kind to me—very, very patient—as I learnt and understood the cultures, the customs and traditions of this very, very vibrant committee. I have always revelled in the colour and vibrancy of that particular community in south-west Sydney, not to mention the culinary delights there—I did put on 15 kilos after Werriwa! That probably adds to a few other things that I'll come to. My efforts to try to speak Vietnamese, as well as Cantonese, certainly kept the locals entertained!
       </p>
       <p>
        A little bit more seriously, I just want to say that I really believe that being a member of parliament is not a job. This is something we do. It is a privilege. It is a privilege to serve. I really believe that the people in this place, regardless of their party affiliations, are here for the right reasons, to make a difference for the better in their communities. Sometimes in the rough and tumble of this place it's easy to be forgotten, but in my case I feel I am slowing down. My health issues, regrettably, have been on public display, courtesy of our colleagues upstairs. I do require some further procedures, which I'll undertake during this break. I believe it's in the best interests of my community to make way for someone with the energy and the commitment to continue to champion the needs of Fowler.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with my high school sweetheart, who I married—I've got to get this right—some 45 years ago, we intend to spend a lot more time in the electorate of Gilmore, so keep up the good work, Fiona! I note I'll be leaving this place in good company: my old mate

       </p>
       <p>
        When I came to this place in 2005 I was asked by a member of the media what my ambitions were. Bear in mind the initial seat was Gough Whitlam's seat of Werriwa. Maybe my answer was not exactly what they thought they were going to get. My answer was simply that my ambition in politics was: when I leave, to be regarded as a half decent local member. Well, the jury is still out.

        An honourable member: No, it's not.

          Chris Hayes
         </a>
         , a great bloke, a great Australian and a great true believer. I'm very proud to call the member for Fowler my friend. He has done quite an extraordinary job. He will leave this place with something that I don't think many of us would say, certainly not myself or the Prime Minister, in that he has no enemies either in front of him or behind him. He is someone who is well loved across this parliament. When he had the health issue last year, ably assisted by Dr Freelander and Dr Gillespie, around this place people were just really, really worried about their mate, because he's held in such high respect. I want to pay tribute to Bernadette as well. He really can be difficult, Bernadette. Going on a motorbike ride this weekend is an interesting decision. I say to the member for Lingiari: you have important duties, because we're not sure that the member for Fowler has always kept himself as safe as he should. As we know, he had a major accident when coming to Canberra just a short while ago as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         He's someone who's absolutely committed to the people of south-western Sydney. He had that commitment through his work with the police as well as with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Workers' Union
         </a>
         , helping people in need. He took on the job of being the candidate for Werriwa in a by-election after the former member for Werriwa somewhat spectacularly left the parliament in January 2005. That was a tough by-election. Labor had lost the election in 2004 and the then Leader of the Labor Party,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Latham" rel="nofollow">
          Mark Latham
         </a>
         , went through a difficult time. The circumstances of that by-election certainly didn't make it a lay-down misere. Chris Hayes worked very hard and he showed himself to be a great candidate and a great advocate for those people. He then, after a redistribution, moved to Fowler and continued to represent that multicultural, vibrant community in south-western Sydney. He has been absolutely committed, for example, to making sure that, at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgerys_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Badgerys Creek
         </a>
         airport, there is maximum job creation for people in his community. He's fought and campaigned very strongly to make sure there's rail access to that community and that it's more than just tarmac—that it's a job generator and an economic growth engine for south-western Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Fowler leaves with goodwill. He leaves at a time of his own choosing. We all wish him well. Down the track, the Labor Party will have an appropriate celebration of his contribution. As chief whip, both in government and opposition, his loyalty to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
          Julia Gillard
         </a>
         , to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Shorten
         </a>
         and to me was unquestioned. He always got the job done. The job of a whip in this place is not perhaps well understood by everyone outside. You have be a confidant, someone people go to with issues and a problem-solver, and you have to do so in a way which requires absolute trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chris Hayes has the absolute trust of everyone in this parliament, not just those on this side. I wish him and Bernadette all the best, including during the time they'll spend on the coast in Gilmore, and I look forward to his contribution up until six o'clock on the very day of the next election, because he'll continue to serve that community in south-western Sydney with all the diligence, commitment and principle that he's shown every single day as a member of the House of Representatives.

         <p>
          on indulgence—I thank the House for the opportunity to join with the Leader of the Opposition in paying great tribute to the member for Fowler. Take his keys, Bernadette!
         </p>
         <p>
          When I first came to this place back in 2007 and we had our induction, I was sitting next to Bernadette at a function upstairs in the members' dining room. Chris was there, and I met them together. As a new member coming into this place, meeting such a wonderful couple, who clearly have travelled life's journey together, as you continue to do now, was a great encouragement to a young member. Coming to this place takes a terrible toll on relationships with the pressures and the demands that come with being a member of parliament. They are a tremendous team and I'm sure the member for Fowler would join me in saying that. Bernadette, I'd say, is the driving member of that team, as I think all of our partners and spouses are, when it comes to our ability to serve in this place. So I want to pay tribute first to you, Bernadette, for your friendship to so many in this place, particularly the partners and spouses of members of this place. You led the group of partners and spouses. You were always reaching out to them whenever you could, and you were a source of encouragement and a source of great friendship to so many. You made people feel incredibly welcome, including a young—or younger—member for Cook when he arrived on that day, and I thank you for your kindness to me and to my wife, Jenny, as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          In regard to the member for Fowler specifically, it is true that he has achieved something quite unique in this place. He is an adornment to this place and we will miss his presence greatly.
         </p>
         <p>
          I think above all people who come to this place bring many talents and skills but the one that the member for Fowler brings is a great pastoral spirit. He is someone who looks at another human being and seeks to connect with them as another human being first. He doesn't see anything else. Those other things come later, I'm sure. But he connects with people and he establishes that bond of trust, which, I have no doubt, is why he has been so successful as a local member in his own community. People of many different backgrounds, of which he wouldn't have as much experience or knowledge, would see a genuine person in an instant, connect with him quickly and form a lasting bond, as he has with so many, if not all of us, here in this place.
         </p>

           He and I
          </a>
          share a fraternity of being the sons of police officers. I want to thank him for his fraternity in talking about and addressing these issues over many years in this place. He kindly wrote to me after my father's passing with a very touching note. I deeply appreciated it at the time and I thank him for that. He met by father and my brother at a police event once and he struck up the same rapport there very kindly with my father and brother straightaway. They said to me, 'Gee, he is a good bloke' and he indeed is a good bloke.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has been a great pleasure to know you in this place. I trust we will see more of you. If not around this place, we will bump into each other along the way on life's journey. I am quite certain that I won't bump into you alone because you will be there in a coffee shop or in a car or talking to someone or in a pub or at a game or something like that and you will be there with Bernadette, continuing to share life's journey. Thank you for your great service to this House.

          <p>
           on indulgence—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
            Chris Hayes
           </a>
           —a hard working MP, a fearless advocate and a dear friend. Today at a very personal level, I will say, after many conversations going back and forth over a couple of years, Bernadette, you won the argument. I was on the other side of it the whole way through—congratulations. I want to talk, first of all, about Chris's advocacy and, secondly, his role as whip. Let me just deal with one issue. He's spoken a lot today about the love of his community, but I want to talk about one other thing. Chris and I share a lot of principles, a lot of values. One of them, which is shared by most people in this room, is a passionate opposition to capital punishment. Many of us have given speeches about it. Many of us have pleaded for clemency to different embassies but it takes a particular strength of character to see the extrajudicial killings from the Duterte government and to make the speech against it in Manila. That's what Chris did. Each time there has been an Australian on death row, Chris has been involved in the advocacy for clemency. It's rarely been media work but it's always been heartfelt, it has always been passionate and it has been about defending Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also, though, want to talk about his role as whip. The whip is often explained to the public and to the media as the person who maintains party discipline. Certainly, there is a long untold story of one very happy night when we took control of the House in the second term of this government, where there was an operation run by Chris Hayes. If it is to be told, it won't be yet. It really was a job well done. But the thing that is not often told about whips is what they do for the pastoral care of every member. There is not a member on either side of this place who hasn't personally benefited from Chris Hayes. What always needs to be appreciated, particularly, is that it's the opposition whip who provides leave for their own side and agrees to the leave when it's requested from the other side. While these speeches have been going on, my phone has been inundated with text messages from women members of the caucus who have used phrases like these: 'I could not have been a mum in the parliament were it not for Chris Hayes.' We have had words about the willingness to give leave, about the flexibility, about every logistic being taken care of. There are always opportunities that we all have and most of us are guilty at different times of, whenever there is an edge, trying to take them. Well, whenever there was a moment for compassion and decency, Chris Hayes has taken it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Different members of parliament inspire different emotions. There are not many of us who inspire universal love from the chamber. Chris Hayes does. We are better for Chris Hayes having been here; we are poorer for him leaving. Chris, for everything you have done, thank you so much. Your electorate is better, the party is better and the parliament is better because you have been one of us.

           </p>
           <p>
            Just picture this: at a suburban cricket ground in Canberra, Chris and I opened the batting against the pesky fourth estate, the press gallery. We were as one. We had a formidable opening partnership. There we were, Chris and I, none for eight after nine overs. The member for Hume and the member for Moreton were yelling out, 'Run, run.' I'm not so sure whether they were yelling for Chris to run me out or for me to run Chris out! But we batted on—struggled on, I should say—for a few more overs, and then both of us ended up getting out and sharing a moment back at the pavilion. Chris then went out afterwards and wicket kept for the full 40 or so overs. That bloke is a dynamo.

            He never gives in and he never lets much past either—but he certainly did when he fell off his motorbike. I can't believe that you're going riding again in regional Australia this weekend. Bernadette, you might have to sort him out. My wife, Catherine, said to me when she first met Bernadette, 'She's a lovely person.' I said, 'If you think she's a lovely person, you should meet her husband.' You are a great bloke. The National Party pays every due respect that you deserve and that you've earned. You have been a mentor, a friend, a true patriot to all of us. On behalf of the National Party, we wish you and Bernadette all the very best for the future.

             on indulgence—This is a speech I never wanted to make, because I wanted
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
              Chris Hayes
             </a>
             to stay our whip and to stay in the parliament certainly for as long as I am here. I can't imagine the parliament without him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chris Hayes, our chief whip, described himself as just another middle aged white guy when he moved to his very multicultural electorate. I've got to say I am the first person to say that Chris Hayes is so much more than that. Chris Hayes is a completely decent person. You don't often meet that here in the parliament. You don't even often meet it in the outside world, but Chris Hayes is a completely decent man. When he moved into his electorate, he made fun of the fact he had to learn Vietnamese and Cantonese and that he was very entertaining for his constituents. Do you know what I've seen when I have worked with Chris in his electorate and visited his electorate? I have seen love and the deepest respect, because his community knows that he is a fighter for them, that he will stand up every time and make a case for better education services, better health care. He'll do the constituent work that is so necessary in a seat that is not only very multicultural but also has pockets of people who are really doing it tough. Everywhere you go with Chris Hayes he is welcomed with open arms and deep respect.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm very pleased that the leader of opposition business mentioned Chris's work against the death penalty. Quietly, relentlessly, at every opportunity, Chris Hayes has stood up against the death penalty. He has been extraordinarily brave in doing so in the Philippines, as the leader of opposition business mentioned. He's also quietly, at his own expense, with no fanfare, visited Australians on death row overseas not once but many times. Again and again he has been there for them and for their families, offering support and pastoral care literally to the very end. It takes a beautiful man to continue to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             The things that matter to Chris are family, faith and the Labor Party. I know that Bernadette will be so grateful to see more of him, as will his children, his beautiful grandchildren, his mum, who he is so very close to, and his brothers and others. Family matters to Chris. One of the things that is so beautiful about his family is that I think they influence his politics as much as he influences theirs. Chris, I think it's fair to say they have sometimes been on my side of the argument over the years! Chris is a man of deep Catholic faith. It is people like the new Pope and Chris Hayes who slowly draw me back towards the early years of the way I was raised. But Chris is not a man of ostentatious faith. He is a man who is guided every day by his deep Catholic faith to offer love, not judgement, to others.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, of course, there is his deep love and loyalty to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             . I know that not being in the parliament won't be a barrier to Chris's continued involvement in the Australian Labor Party. He'll be a Labor man until the day he dies, but we will miss him deeply.

              on indulgence—Many fine words have been spoken about
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
               Chris Hayes
              </a>
              —all deserved—and I associate myself with the fine speeches that have been made by the previous speakers. It hasn't been possible to go outside of this building to a restaurant anywhere in Kingston without seeing Chris, with Bernadette by his side. In fact, Bernadette, you must share some of the blame for the weight he's put on by taking him to these restaurants and the resulting health condition he finds himself in, which we hope he recovers from quickly. Chris and Bernadette were never separated. It is a beautiful partnership and they are interdependent. The love they have for each other is obvious to all of their friends and, no doubt, to their family and to their community as well. I think that has enriched each of them over the course of the last 16 years. The spouses of parliamentarians endure the slings and arrows that are inevitable in this job. For Chris's world to be sustained here—it's very hard without support from your family and your partner. The way in which you two have been able to work as one is a wonderful reflection on your faith and also on the people who you are. I pay tribute to that relationship, which I think has been the underpinning of Chris's success.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also want to pay tribute to Chris for the work that he's done in particular through the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Federation" rel="nofollow">
               Police Federation
              </a>
              of Australia and his time as an advocate for police officers. The Prime Minister spoke very passionately earlier, no doubt influenced by his father's own service, of the service of the officers in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              who will be undertaking gruesome work today. Chris too was guided by the service of his own father. It instilled in him values and principles that have served him well in the service of other police officers. His father would be incredibly proud of the life that he's led and the way in which his contribution, not only through the industrial work that he's done, has resulted in increasing the pay of police officers—and I am sure they are grateful for that. Chris's advocacy has, no doubt, resulted in the saving of lives of police officers as well, in improving work place conditions. The way in which he's advocated for those officers is something he's immensely proud of and that all of us in this place, on both sides, who have served as police officers have greatly appreciated. The approaches that he's made to provide support to us over a number of years and the way in which, to this very day, he continues to support the work of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFA" rel="nofollow">
               PFA
              </a>
              and police around the country are recognised deeply by many.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hayesie, you share the great adoration of both sides of this chamber. The public has seen its parliament probably not at its best over the last fortnight, but there are many in this parliament, on both sides, who share many of your attributes. There are many fine people in this place and it's a great calling to answer, to serve in this parliament, and you have served this parliament with great distinction. You should be incredibly proud of that—certainly, we are.
             </p>
             <p>
              We wish you every success and the best of health in retirement. The many years that you enjoy in retirement will be a product of the decades that you have put into your local community, into your family and into your life. It's a life that has been well lived—it's only halfway there! This is not an obituary, of course—often, in these presentations that we make we speak in the past tense! But Chris has an enormous amount to contribute in many forms into the future. I wish you and Bernadette every continued success. We will miss you deeply.

               on indulgence—I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Fowler for the work we've been able to do together as chief whips on either side of this parliament. That's not only in our role as whips but in previous roles on committees where we have served together. I'd like to associate myself with the remarks which were made by the previous speakers in acknowledging your service, not only in this parliament, Chris, but also in our community over a much longer period of time. If there's one thing that I've seen in you over the time that I have got to know you in this place, it's your willingness to serve our community.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, more importantly, there is the joy you get out of serving our community. I think that's one thing we can all take away from the example you have set for all of us: to enjoy and take joy from the responsibilities and opportunities we've been given to serve our communities. I want to thank Bernadette as well for your role in leading the parliamentary partners group. As the Prime Minister outlined, there was the welcome you gave to my wife, Judi, when she first became part of the parliamentary partners and there has been the time which you have served together on the committee there.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is a true partnership and I wish you both every success for the future. I look forward to continuing to work with you for the rest of this term, but I thank you for your service to this parliament and to the community throughout your life.

                <p>
                 on indulgence—Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just briefly want to put on the record my thanks to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
                  Chris Hayes
                 </a>
                 for his friendship over many, many years. I first met Chris in May 1995 when I started with the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Workers Union
                 </a>
                 . Chris was the assistant national secretary of the union and I was a trainee organiser. Despite him holding that lofty office he always had time for someone like myself, who was learning the ropes of the Australian industrial relations system. He was always popping into the office and seeing how I was going and providing advice. Chris taught me the ins and outs of the arbitration system and appearing before the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                  Industrial Relations Commission
                 </a>
                 , as it then was. He taught me the importance of working with workers but also, importantly, he taught me the importance of patience. I think if there's one thing that Chris does represents, it's patience. He had a very distinguished career, not only with the Australian Workers Union but with the Police Association, representing workers and being patient in advocating for better wages and conditions for workers throughout the country, and he did that very successfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I started with the Australian Workers Union through a program that was organised and run by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
                  ACTU
                 </a>
                 called Organising Works, and there are many on this side of the parliament who have benefited from that traineeship program. When I graduated from that program we had a little bit of a ceremony that was put on by the ACTU. I really appreciated the fact that Chris was the only senior union official in the country who turned up to that graduation. I thought that spoke volumes about his commitment to the union movement and to workers' rights, and also to imparting his knowledge to future generations. That's something that I've never forgotten and I thank you for it sincerely, Chris.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As others have mentioned, it's a partnership with Bernadette and, Bernadette, we pay tribute to you for your role in that partnership. I particularly want to say on behalf of the many police throughout this country who love Chris: thank you for your work in advocating for them. I even pass on congratulations and thanks from Randall Meadows from the Arlington Police Association in Texas, who you know as a good friend. He asked me to pass on those congratulations on his behalf. We wish you and Bernadette all the very best.

                  I will be brief. I won't repeat all the tributes to you, Chris, and to Bernadette; they're all very well deserved indeed. I have become good friends with Chris, particularly in my time as Speaker. I was always told that you easily made friends on both sides of the House. As I said last week, when we had the unveiling of former

Our offices have worked very closely together and we have worked very closely together, and with the Chief Government Whip, particularly through the course of last year where we had almost daily phone hook-ups on ensuring we could get the parliament to work and what the arrangements would be. As I said, all of the tributes are very well deserved. You're a first-class person in so many respects, but, as Speaker, can I say: you will be remembered as a first-class parliamentarian in every way. We wish you the best for the rest of your term; I know you are staying on in your role as Chief Opposition Whip, and I will continue to work with you in that regard. Thank you very much.
