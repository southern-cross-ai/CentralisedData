         <p>
          Forty-six, thank you to the member for Spence. Commander Houen joined the Navy 22 years ago after graduating from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           University of Western Australia
          </a>
          . Her motivation for joining the Navy was based around the career and training opportunities, the opportunity to travel the world and an underpinning desire to serve her country, Australia. As I am the shadow minister for defence personnel, many of our discussions this week have revolved around the opportunities for young people joining defence today. Specifically, I asked Janna to highlight the three key reasons why Australians should consider a career in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          today.
         </p>
         <p>
          First, there are opportunities to work on new and emerging technologies. The Australian Defence Force offers Australians the opportunity to work on new and emerging technologies. Whether that be the opportunity to train in cybersecurity, emerging nuclear technologies or weaponry, there are exciting and endless opportunities for everyday Australians wishing to consider a career in the Australian Defence Force.
         </p>
         <p>
          In regard to training, for the majority of careers with the Australian Defence Force no experience is required. The Australian Defence Force provides Australians wishing to join with access to all the world-class training they require, whether this be through a university degree, through the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force Academy
          </a>
          or through nationally recognised industry training in a technical trade. The Australian Defence Force offers school leavers and all Australians exceptional training and career opportunities. And it doesn't have to be just school leavers. You might have been out of school and been working; you might be in your mid-twenties and looking for a new opportunity. You can apply now as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are opportunities to serve. We live in a great country. Ultimately, one of the fundamental reasons people consider joining the Australian Defence Force is the opportunity to serve one's country, Australia. In recent years, the Australian Defence Force has been involved in a number of national and regional operations to protect our national interests, whether this be assistance to respond to national disasters in our region or as part of an international response. It's more than a career and an opportunity to make a difference to those in need. I myself have a son in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Army
          </a>
          . I couldn't be more proud of his and his colleagues' commitment to service, courage, respect, integrity and excellence. I know from my own involvement in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program—and I'm sure other members in this chamber who have participated know—that all of the people whom I've met are first-class Australians. I couldn't be more proud of the men and women who serve in the ADF.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would encourage anyone finishing high school or anyone looking for a new challenge or adventure to consider a career with the Defence Force. Not only is it rewarding; you will be guaranteed of living a life whose story is worth telling. For more information, I think it's adfcareers.gov.au. It was defencejobs.gov.au, but I think it's now adfcareers.gov.au. If you have friends or family in Defence Force, talk to them. They might be reserves or they might be full time. I'd encourage all Australians to talk to them, because it is certainly a career worth having.
         </p>
         <p>
          I just want to talk really quickly about homeownership. Australia is a land of opportunity. It's a land of hope and optimism. I think every Australian can get into their own home and I want to encourage everyone in my own electorate to look at some of the incentives that the Australian government provides. Since I've been in parliament there have been a number of programs that the Australia government has offered, particularly around the first home super saver scheme, the First Home Guarantee and, for single parents, the Family Home Guarantee. The first home super saver scheme is a way for you to save tax and get your deposit much more quickly than saving in a bank. The First Home Guarantee means that, if you're working full-time and you can get a loan, the federal government will ensure that your mortgage insurance is paid for, saving you a lot of money. You can use other state based schemes as well. The Family Home Guarantee has helped single parents get in. Look it up. It's on my website at lukehowarth.com.au.
