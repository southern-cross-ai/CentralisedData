       <p>
        This government's arrogance absolutely appals me. One of my first actions as the re-elected member for Macquarie was to ask the government to include me on the Forum on Western Sydney Airport, which is the only forum where concerns about the flight paths of a 24-hour-a-day airport can be raised. The various ministers responsible for this airport have refused to include me on FOWSA, clearly afraid of having a person who isn't in love with the idea of having a major airport with no curfew on her doorstep.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Tudge again rejected my request, saying that the forum's membership only has four people who are state or federal members of parliament. What the minister conveniently forgot to mention was that he intended to put another pro-airport member on the forum, the member for Lindsay. Now, I know the member for Lindsay is well aware of the impact that flights will have over our homes because she lives in one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        areas most likely to be affected. Her home, her neighbour's home, their children's schools are all expected to bear high noise levels. But I don't hear her demanding that the government release information about flight paths or demanding noise protections.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was meant to be the Forum on Western Sydney Airport, not a powwow of 'Fans of Western Sydney Airport'. It is yet another example of this government doing everything it can to avoid scrutiny and to avoid the voices of people who don't agree with it being heard. They need to include more people from the Blue Mountains and representing the Hawkesbury on this forum.
