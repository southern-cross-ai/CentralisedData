       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to rise in this House today and acknowledge the work of the Australian Rural Leadership Foundation. In particular I would like to acknowledge the work and the presence in the House today of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the ARLF, Lesley Fitzpatrick, and take this opportunity to thank her for what she has done for the Australian rural leadership community. I am a graduate of the ARLF's Australian Rural Leadership Program, and I am very proud to acknowledge the impact it has had on me and my colleagues over 21 years of its operation in Australia. Not only has the ARLP produced great leaders; it has also supported the development, right across Victoria, of community based leadership programs. Over the past week, I have had the honour of talking to people from five of those community leadership programs in this parliament. I have taken the opportunity to encourage them to put their hands up and say yes to leadershipâ€”leadership in this parliament, leadership in their communities and, most importantly, leadership within Australia. In bringing my comments to a close, I say thank you to Lesley and to her staff and board, for all they have done to help make rural and regional Australia a much better place in which to live.
