         I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for the question and I know how concerned he is to try to ensure better living conditions for people in the remote Indigenous communities in his electorate. I think it is important to keep the House informed on this issue because of the great public interest that it has generated. But it is important to dwell not just on the extent of addiction but also on the determination of local Indigenous people to make a difference, because they can see how these substances are poisoning their kids.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the recent budget the government did commit $55 million to combat petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in Indigenous townships and settlements. This includes $20 million that has been earmarked to roll out the unsniffable Opal petrol to an additional 33 sites, including 15 roadhouses that are close to Indigenous townships. That will take to 92 the total number of sites around Australia where unsniffable Opal petrol is available. The budget commitment also includes $15 million to support community patrols and community justice groups and also youth recreation programs, because it is important to make sniffing less attractive as well as harder to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of this can work. For instance, I am advised that since Opal was put into the Papunya community the number of petrol sniffers has dropped from about 60 to almost zero, according to the community council chairman. But there are quite a few problems in this area. I have recently been advised that kava abuse is now a problem in up to eight Aboriginal townships in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">
          Arnhem Land
         </a>
         . The government is currently working with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         to try to address this issue. Unfortunately, there are no magic bullets here. Alienation and directionlessness do not dissipate overnight. But the government is determined to make the investments necessary. The government will not hesitate to make the investments necessary where we think there are programs which are reasonably capable of making a difference.
