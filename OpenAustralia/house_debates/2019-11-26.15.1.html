       <p>
        Our community campaign to fix the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        faster has made some incredible progress, with more money to be spent sooner to 'fix it faster'. Since being elected, I have been calling on the government to urgently bring forward the funding for the highway. I have offered to work with all levels of government, regardless of party, to get it done. I have used every available opportunity to bring this critical local issue to the government's attention and to get results for our local community, including in my first speech to parliament, my first question in question time and my first debate on a matter of public importance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that the government has finally listened to what we have all been saying for so long: that we need to fix it faster for the good of the economy and, most importantly, to save the lives of people on our roads. I will continue to work constructively with the government on this vitally important issue and will continue advocating for further improvements like the Jervis Bay Road intersection. Our campaign won't stop until the Princes Highway is made safer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take the time to acknowledge the work of the Ulladulla and Milton district community forums, who have now combined to form the Milton-Ulladulla bypass committee and have worked tirelessly on this issue. I also want to thank everyone in our community and local media who has helped spread the message that we needed to fix it faster. Thank you.
