        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to representations made to the member for Flynn by Longreach Motors, a car dealership in his electorate. Did the Treasurer have a personal phone conversation with that dealer? Did the Treasurer receive updates about that dealer’s progress on his home fax?

              I certainly will, Mr Speaker, because at the core of the discussion about how car dealers were treated and who dealt with them has been the claim by the Leader of the Opposition based on a fake email. He is now so desperate that he is now trying to say that I am responsible for the fake email that he peddled around the country. I could not believe it on

                <p>
                 Yes, I am delighted to respond to the question. The shadow Treasurer said, ‘Did he find a car dealer.’ I found many car dealers. In fact I released some correspondence overnight that shows that other car dealers were receiving as much, if not more, attention from the Treasury than Mr Grant. There were many car dealers receiving attention from the Treasury. That is the case. Built around this is a farrago of lies from those opposite about how these cases were being handled.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One of the ones that is put around is that Mr Grant had personal updates sent to the Treasurer’s fax. I just want to go through that one again, Mr Speaker, because there were something like 130 emails sent to my office by Mr Grech—130 emails—and almost 30 per cent of those emails from Mr Grech to my office contained documents specifically for my attention. One of those did go to my home fax. Why? Because I happened to be at home. That is a remarkable thing to happen, isn’t it, Mr Speaker? This year the office has sent 209 faxes to my home via email, a total of 1,487 pages, and since I have become Treasurer, 4,638 pages have been sent to my home fax. So let’s just dispense with that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course there is also the notion that there is some conspiracy because some of the emails were copied to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury" rel="nofollow">
                  Secretary of the Treasury
                 </a>
                 . Mr Grech sent 131 emails to my office. Dr Henry was copied in to 82 of those emails. The next suggestion that we hear from those opposite is that Mr Grant received personal referrals to finance companies and that somehow he was the only person who received a personal referral to finance companies. I was talking to the

                      over there has been trying to maintain that somehow Ford Credit was going to be a beneficiary of $500 million direct from the federal Treasury. Of course that was not the case at all.

There is a lot of emotion in the chamber but there is an expectation that members will rise above that emotion. That is to both sides, because, as I said yesterday, this is not a debate that will be won by those that can shout the loudest. The Treasurer has the call and the Treasurer will commence to sum up his answer.

                                      Many dealers were contacting members of parliament, many dealers were contacting their trade organisation, many dealers were contacting the Treasury directly, and many of those were being put in contact with car finance companies.

                                      yesterday, I said I would follow up, through the Treasury, matters that were raised with me by two members of this House. I take those matters very seriously. I will take this matter seriously as well. I raised the two matters that were raised with me by members in this House yesterday with the Secretary to the Treasury today. He is looking at those matters and he will come back to me.
