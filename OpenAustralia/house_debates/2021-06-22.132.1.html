        All roads this weekend lead to Emerald in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Highlands" rel="nofollow">

        . The social atmosphere will be abuzz, with four large events happening. There are Ag-Grow's field days,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQ" rel="nofollow">

        Inland Port and SEAWAY Logistics' launch; the celebration of Emerald Agricultural College's 50-year reunion, and the Emerald Rodeo.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ag-Grow field days are a three-day event on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Ag-Grow was established over 30 years ago. There will be over 300 traders and exhibitors. Twenty thousand visitors are expected. This year sees the introduction of a new ladies' lane, catering for all the things ladies have to have: hats, boots, jewellery and more. There'll be working cattle-dog sales; superior beef bull sales, with 100 bulls on offer of all breeds; and an invitation horse sale.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a year's hiatus, Ag-Grow is back and bigger than ever. Tractors and car sales are at an all-time high. Why not take advantage of the coalition's instant cash write-off? That's what people are doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish Geoff Dein and his team a successful event. Thanks go to the volunteers and sponsors that make these great days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CQ Inland Port and SEAWAY Logistics' launch will be 25 kilometres east of Emerald at Yamala in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        at the intermodal hub. There's the official launch of SEAWAY, a Melbourne company coming to Central Queensland for the first timeâ€”imports; exports; general freight and container packaging; terminal operators. Congratulations to both the Stent-Smith family and to SEAWAY for their new venture and partnership.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also Emerald Agricultural College's 50-year reunion. My good friend Ian Burnett was in the first intake of students, and he will be there on Saturday. Events over the day include a cocktail reception, time-capsule opening and tour of the college and farm, with the reunion dinner that night. In 2019, the state government closed both the Emerald and Longreach agricultural colleges. This was disappointing, to say the least. We are looking for a new enterprise to pick up these challenges, to reopen these colleges.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the Emerald Rodeo will be on Saturday night at the Emerald Showground. It's sure to attract a big crowd.
       </p>
       <p>
        So there's plenty of fun, food and entertainment, all happening in Emerald this weekend. I look forward to attending these events.
