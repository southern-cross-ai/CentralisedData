       <p>
        I wish to inform the Main Committee of significant achievers in the electorate of Fisher who were recipients of the Fisher Community Australia Day Awards. This is an award system I set up in 2000 to honour and recognise those residents of Fisher who make significant contributions to the community and to their fellow citizens. This year, an award for Fisher Citizen of the Year was presented for the first time. In selecting who would be a fitting and deserving recipient of this prestigious award, the Fisher Australia Day committee members looked for traits like exceptional service, sacrifice, preparedness to do more and long-term commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        With that in mind, the committee decided this inaugural award would go not to one individual but to two men: Mr Ross Christie and Mr Barry Jones for their services to the community through the Kawana Waters Surf Life Saving Club. They have made an incredible effort and have contributed greatly to the lifestyle of club members. They have trained club members and they keep our beaches safe for tourists, visitors and locals alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year, the committee also presents an award, the Des Scanlan Memorial Shield, to a community group that has contributed greatly to their community. This award is presented in honour of the late Des Scanlan, who passed away in early 1999. He was one of the

       </p>
       <p>
        The award this year went to the Maroochydore

It is great to recognise wonderful Australians who are role models for their fellow citizens.
