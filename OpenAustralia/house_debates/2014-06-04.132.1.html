       <p>
        I rise to put on the record in the parliament the achievements of one of my great constituents, the world No. 1 in golfing, and a very proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA" rel="nofollow">
         PGA
        </a>
        member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott" rel="nofollow">
         Adam Scott
        </a>
        . The parliament would be no stranger to Adam and his recent achievements and what he has done in the world of golf. He now holds the No. 1 position in the official world golf rankings. As the parliament would be aware, at the end of May Adam return to the PGA Tour at the Crowne Plaza Invitational, which was his first tournament contested as the world No. 1. I think we all recognise that he claimed that tournament in dramatic style, confirming to all why he truly is at the pinnacle of his game and currently the world's best golfer.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is certainly a credit to our country; he is certainly an inspiration to young golfers coming through. He is a great bloke; he is an inspiration to his sport. The PGA can be very, very proud of this member of their organisation and this world No. 1. He has represented Australia for many, many years. He represents our nation with professionalism, he represents our nation with class and, just like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Norman
        </a>
        —the Shark—did decades ago, he has garnered a nation behind him to show what Australia can do on the world stage. There is an argument we can make—and I will certainly make it right here in this House—that he is right now our most successful sportsman currently competing, and we can all be very proud of what he has done.
