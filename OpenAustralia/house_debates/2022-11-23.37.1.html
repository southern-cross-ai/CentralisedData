        The Raise Our Voice Australia campaign allows young people to express their vision for our nation's parliament. Today I'm thrilled to speak on behalf of 18-year-old Benjamin Springhall from my electorate. Benjamin writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Next year, I will be venturing out into the real world as I pursue a Bachelor's degree in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         International Relations
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First off, University sounds scary. It's scary because I have to find a whole new place to live, which at this point in time sounds impossible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Being a kid from the small regional town of Kingaroy, I must leave home and travel to Brisbane or a larger city for university.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst it is possible for a regional kid to do university online these days, it is hard to gain the new experiences and full education of being on campus.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The parliament should implement more support to regional kids leaving home, some of which have never been to a city before.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Increased funding in regional education could even one day give regional kids the opportunity to commence university not far from home.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst I wouldn't be considered extremely disadvantaged, I worry about the financial stress my parents and I will go through on this unknown journey.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The financial stress in this day and age alone is worrying, however for someone from the regions, it is truly horrifying.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The politicians in Canberra should work with bipartisanship to ensure all youth have equal opportunity. The future of this nation lies in their hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Benjamin, you are right: the stress and financial pressures that our regional young people face when it comes to education are massive. As a parliament, we must work together, and, as the federal member for Maranoa, I will fight for this.

         I would like to share with you the words of 21-year-old Emily Rush from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara" rel="nofollow">
          McNamara
         </a>
         . Emily participated in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
          Youth Voice
         </a>
         in Parliament campaign, which asks young people around Australia what they think our new government should accomplish. I would also like to note that Raise Our Voice Australia is run by Ashleigh, who lives in the great electorate of McNamara. Here are Emily's words:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want Australia's new parliament to address the cost-of-living crisis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In 2020 I moved to this electorate from a small country town excited to start a new life in Melbourne. When Covid struck, not only was I isolated and alone in my little apartment, but as a renter my expenses only grew. In the span of a year, I had to work multiple jobs to barely afford my rent.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There were weeks where I had to choose between buying my groceries and paying my rent.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As a result of all of this I had to put my education on pause.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want to see a government that will help young people like me to ease the cost of living pressures we face because I know I'm not alone.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Without change I see myself as only being a renter.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My parents are able to own their own house, but her me that seems like more of a dream than a reality.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Young people are tired of waiting.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We need change now.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We need action.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to Emily: I really appreciate you putting those words together, and we'll work extremely hard in this place to deliver for you and the other young people in our great country.
