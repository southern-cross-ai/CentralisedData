        My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Will the minister please inform the House of what the government has done to meet its commitment to recognise the Battle for Australia?

         I thank the member for Flynn for his question. Today I am very pleased to announce that the government has met yet another of its election commitments: an official national observance day of the Battle for Australia. Members on all sides would be aware of the push over a number of years for a better understanding of what occurred around Australia, and particularly to our north, during the Pacific war. I note that we are talking about a national mobilisation that involved the entire population of some seven million people. With respect to this initiative, the battles normally referred to are those that occurred on the

         and around

         —and members know of the terrible bombings; there were over 60 in Darwin and hundreds were killed—as well as the

         and various others around Northern Australia. To recognise this officially was a commitment made some years ago by the Labor Party when it was in opposition, and it remained part of our policy at the last election. The official promulgation of this day, as authorised by the Governor-General, therefore meets a commitment that was an important part of our program.

         I want to particularly acknowledge the work of the

         veterans, are very pleased to see this initiative coming to fruition. There will be a series of activities and commemorations occurring around the date—which will be the first Wednesday in September each year—to acknowledge the sacrifice, courage and national effort that we can all be proud of. I urge all members, and I am sure all members will know that we have taken this decision, to ensure that this day is properly commemorated and properly acknowledged and that there is a better understanding of what occurred to our forebears when they defended our country at a time of very great need.

          On indulgence, on behalf of this side of the House I support the decision made by the government to recognise the Battle for Australia. The year 1942 was arguably the most important one in this country’s history since European arrival. Whilst I know that not all members of the Australian community will support this, I want to make it clear that this is supported by this side of the House. I congratulate the government for making the decision.
