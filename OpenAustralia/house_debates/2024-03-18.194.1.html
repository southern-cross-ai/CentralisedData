        Young people want to be able to pay off their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        debts but the current system of indexation means that they are falling back, not moving forward. Many will find on 1 July that they owe more than ever before, even though they've been working hard to pay down their debt. It makes it impossible to save for a home deposit.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week showed exactly how much Australians want their government to listen to them. Four days ago I put up a petition calling on the government to fix HECS debts. Already, in four days, more than 55,000 people of all generations and from all states—nurses, teachers, small business owners, professionals, students and retirees—have signed that petition. In four days we have generated what we think is the single-biggest public request ever to address the dreadful problem which is HECS debts. This is our government's chance to show that it is listening to young people. I've asked to meet with the Minister for Education this week, and I will provide him with that petition in person.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is our chance to fix HECS debts; the more people who sign that petition before I meet with the minister, the harder it will be for him to ignore it. Fixing HECS, making housing affordable, making groceries affordable or taking effective action on climate change: there's a lot that we can do to make the next generation feel proud of us. There's a lot that we must do.
