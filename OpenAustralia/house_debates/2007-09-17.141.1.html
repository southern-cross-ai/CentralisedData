        The government is grateful to those who provided submissions during the recent Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts inquiry into the bill’s provisions. We are mindful of the recommendations made by the Senate committee and have considered a number of issues raised through that process. The government seeks to amend the provisions concerning state and territory laws so that only laws or parts of laws specifically named by regulation can be excluded. This will ensure that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ’s goal of streamlining can be achieved while providing a further safeguard against possible unintended effects on other laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to these provisions, I reiterate the government’s intention to continue to work cooperatively with states and territories to transition to a single national reporting system that meets their needs. A further amendment will clarify the Australian government’s obligation to provide data to states and territories, provided that certain conditions are met relating to security of data and streamlining of reporting. The amendments will also establish a right of appeal to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        to enable state and territory governments to appeal against a decision of the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer not to disclose greenhouse and energy information. Taken together, these amendments demonstrate the government’s willingness to work cooperatively with state and territory governments to set up the least burdensome national reporting system.
