        The member for Fraser was going so well till the end! This weekend will see businesses, community organisations, sporting clubs and individuals come together for a heath check at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Ulverstone West's Health and Wellbeing Expo. Together with Australian Rotary Health and beyondblue, the Rotary Club of Ulverstone West organises and hosts Tasmania's largest annual health and wellbeing expo for families in my electorate of Braddon and beyond. This event helps the community to connect and access both mental and physical health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        One in six people in Australia will experience depression at some stage in their lives and one in four will experience anxiety. This means that, in my electorate of Braddon alone, over 18,000 people have had, or are battling with, depression, and over 11,500 have experienced, or are dealing with, anxiety—staggering figures. Unfortunately, many of these people do not seek help, sadly leading, all too often, to suicide. Of the 65,000 Australians who attempt to take their own life each year, it is estimated that a high percentage are battling undiagnosed depression. I urge anyone who is battling with depression or suicidal thoughts to get in touch with beyondblue on 1300 22 46 36.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Health and Wellbeing Expo happening in Ulverstone tomorrow provides the opportunity for members of the community to access free health and wellbeing information. Exhibitors at the expo will range from mental health services like beyondblue and Rural Alive &amp; Well, to physical health services like Hearing Australia and Lungs in Poor Shape, and community services like the central coast men's shed. In conjunction with this event, Mayor Jan Bonde of

        ambassador for the event. Hat Day is an annual initiative of Australian Rotary Health, with money raised going to research helping Australians with mental illnesses. As Hat Day ambassador, Mayor Jan Bonde will use her impeccable taste to judge the hats that will be on display at the expo.
       </p>
       <p>
        This expo is an important part of connecting our businesses, community organisations, sporting clubs and members of our community with each other to support each other and those around us. As part of this event, I look forward to joining members of the community at the sold-out beyondblue gala dinner on Saturday evening. Speaking to the 200-strong crowd, mental health guest speakers will be promoting awareness of all facets of mental health, including youth suicide prevention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Health and Wellbeing Expo and beyondblue gala has grown rapidly in the six years since it first began. I congratulate organiser, and my good friend, Lindsay Morgan and the whole team at the Rotary Club of Ulverstone West, beyondblue and Australian Rotary Health on what I am sure will be a fantastic event at the Ulverstone Civic Centre tomorrow from 10 am to 3 pm.

        It is well known that in October everything turns pink to raise awareness and money for breast cancer. Tomorrow in Burnie,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         Pink Ribbon
        </a>
        stalls will be set up to collect donations and sell ribbons for the Cancer Council's research into better treatments and prevention of breast cancer, as well as for support services and prevention programs across the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day in Australia, around 50 women are told they have breast cancer or a gynaecological cancer. Sadly, around 12 Australian women will die each day from a women's cancer. I doubt there is a person in Australia or in this chamber, probably, who has not been affected by cancer, whether personally or through having a member of their family or a close friend or workmate being diagnosed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Awareness_Month" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer Awareness Month
        </a>
        , I am attending, along with many others in my community, the Unite in Pink Breakfast being held next Tuesday morning. This breakfast, hosted by local personality Katy Pakinga, is a chance for the community to come together to support Tasmanian women affected by cancer. We are joining together to support those who are currently fighting and those who have fought this horrid disease, whilst at the same time raising awareness and money so we may reduce the number of women who will have to fight this battle. I encourage anyone who can to buy tickets to this great event by calling 64258602 or visiting cancertas.org.au, or to support your local Pink Ribbon stall by making a donation—a good donation—or by buying and wearing a ribbon.
