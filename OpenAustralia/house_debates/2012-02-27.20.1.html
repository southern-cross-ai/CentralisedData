        Last Friday I also had the privilege of attending the Marburg State School. In my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland we have received $105 million for 64 local schools under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In fact, many of those schools received benefit in such a way that they assisted the flood evacuation recovery. For instance, at places like Fernvale and Esk the halls acted as the flood evacuation centres for local communities. Without the building of those halls there would have been simply nowhere for local communities to go to as they had to rush away from flooding waters. For example, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redbank_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Redbank Creek
        </a>
        in Esk broke the banks and went through the township. In Fernvale the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        did likewise.

        But it is small country schools that have benefited so much, including Prenzlau State School, with $300,000. It was great to be there with Terry Hermann. The road off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrego_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        to Prenzlau State School is named after the Hermann family. The school was built in 1894. The new library will help the couple of dozen kids who go to that school. It is a farming community that has been settled there for many years. Terry said his great-grandfather would have loved to have been there but his grandfather attended the school. It is great that he could be there and provide assistance and it is great for local school community.
