        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. What action is the Albanese government taking to respond to the

         I thank the member for Werriwa for her important question and for her advocacy on a continued basis as I've engaged with her on behalf of the 1,500 veterans in her community. All members of this place advocate on behalf of their veterans, and that is a very good thing.

         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which was supported by this government, handed down its interim report in August last year. I'm proud that in September I was able to present the government's formal response to that interim report—a sign of a good, competent government getting on with the job that is required of it by the Australian public, getting on with the job of implementing those recommendations. We responded to those 13 recommendations and have taken steps in respect of all 13 recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today I was able to advance our work in respect of recommendation 1, to harmonise and simplify veterans entitlements legislation. As the royal commission pointed out, the complexity of the legislation veterans have to deal with, and the delays veterans have had to deal with because of the complexity of that legislation, has been a contributor to the suicidality of our veterans. That is a national tragedy we have had to confront. That's why today I announced our pathway for consultation—the Veterans' Legislation Reform Consultation Pathway—setting out a way forward for us to improve the circumstances for our veterans, looking at an alternative way, closing out the two older schemes that have been in existence for well over 100 years, over a century, and moving forward for new claims to be dealt with under the remaining 21st century scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have announced today is a proposal for consultation. We want to work closely with those who are affected the most—our veterans, their families, our defence personnel—as well as engage with health professionals, veterans advocates and the many other people engaged in our veterans support system. We will be taking this pathway out for consultation, listening to people and their views and making sure we get this right on behalf of our veterans. I very much look forward to, as well as engaging in those direct consultations around the country with organisations and individuals, engaging with the opposition, the crossbench parties and the Independents to make sure we can all deliver a better future for our veterans and families. If we don't, there will be lives that will continue to be lost.
