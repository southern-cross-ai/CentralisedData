       <p>
        A few weeks ago, 50 of our most outstanding local people and groups were honoured at the first ever Local Legends Awards. The Local Legends Awards are a way of recognising those who make an outstanding contribution to our local area by giving up their time to help others. I am frequently amazed by the selfless acts which help make ours a community which looks out for each other and looks after each other and by people who enhance our quality of life by dedicating their skills, their enthusiasm and their energy in a diverse range of causes right around our electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        A huge number of nominations were received, all of them reflecting the outstanding spirit and devotion present in our local community. The 50 successful award winners, nominated by their colleagues, reflected the diversity of our electorate, with a wide range of ages, backgrounds, community groups and all kinds of tasks represented. The recipients' contributions were to things like breakfast clubs, sporting groups and welfare groups. They are people who devote their time to make sure that other people in our community do things just a little bit easier.
