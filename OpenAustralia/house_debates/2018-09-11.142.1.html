         Australian National Flag Day
        </a>
        was held on 3 September, and it was a day to celebrate the contribution of our flag to our national civic life and as a symbol of this great nation. It was a day to remind ourselves of the first moment our national icon was flown over the dome of that wonderful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_Building" rel="nofollow">

        in Melbourne. It's also an opportunity to reflect on the symbolism of the flag, and that's what we did in the Goldstein electorate. We produced a booklet on the history and the traditions of the flag. There were people who designed the modern Australian flag, but, more critically, did you know, Deputy Speaker, one of the five winners of the original flag competition was a resident of the Goldstein community living in Beaumaris? He was a lovely fellow by the name of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Ivor Evans
        </a>
        . To honour his legacy and to celebrate his achievement, we produced a booklet that educated people about the flag, and we presented new flags to some of the schools in the Goldstein electorate.

        I'd like to acknowledge St Finbar's Primary School and particularly their principal, Pat Berlingeri, who was wonderful in hosting us. At Katandra School, we had a ceremony in which Bella presented the Australian flag, Jackson the Aboriginal flag and Cooper the

        , Elsternwick, we met with the head of campus, Jacinta Janssens, and the head of the junior school, Kieran McCrohan. And at Stella Maris' Flag Day, we had a celebration with Rob Horwood, the principal, and Yvan Frederic, the deputy principal.

        The celebrations keep coming in the Goldstein community, including of course, for our recipients of Local Sporting Champion grants:
