        I would like to acknowledge the Sutherland Shire Relay For Life. Earlier in May, 1,207 community members ran for over 24 hours in torrential rain and thunderstorms raising $360,000 for cancer. I saw these abysmal conditions firsthand—puddles, sideways rain and very strong winds—and the participants were amazing. Also incredible were the volunteers, and they make it happen every year. They showed me what Cook is really about—the deep sense of community and care—and I'd like to acknowledge them.

        , Jenny Nicholas, Linda Burg, Sharon Sue Sheppard and Lorraine Donne looked after the survivors and carers of cancer. I'd also like to acknowledge Luke Kemmler and Brett Brosen; Emma Broadhurst and Kathryn Broadhurst, who took care of youth activities; and Jasper Downs, who took care of the youth stage and dancers. I'd also like to acknowledge the major clubs and sponsors: Tradies; Ansto; Carers Gateway; Caringbah Rotary, with Cathy and Richard Mason and the other Rotary volunteers; Genesis Care; Madame Foodie; Peak Health; and Pilates Power and Physiotherapy in Cronulla.

        It was an amazing effort, and I want to thank all of those people and all of the participants for showing me what the community and care in Cook is all about.
