       <p>
        I rise tonight to speak in condolence of the loss of two brave young Australian men: Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. The tragedy of 30 May was deeply felt across my electorate of Hughes. Indeed, this sense of loss was felt across our entire country as we joined together in deep sympathy for their friends, family and colleagues, who without a doubt carry the greatest share of the nation's collective sorrow. My local community particularly mourned the loss of the second soldier based out of our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Barracks
        </a>
        to fall in Afghanistan in recent weeks following the death of Sergeant Brett Wood, who was then followed by the tragic loss of Sapper Rowan Robinson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lieutenant Marcus Case was born in Melbourne in 1984. Marcus grew up in a large and very close family as the youngest of six children. He was a popular young man with many close friends who admired his bravery, loyalty and sense of adventure. Marcus' self-described No. 1 fans—his parents, Lee and Bernard—say their son was born to fly. His all too short life reflects this goal, which he worked towards and successfully achieved. Lieutenant Case first entered the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        in June 2002 as a student at the University of Melbourne before deferring his studies in 2003 to undertake the commando selection training process with the 1st
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Commando Regiment
        </a>
        . Never forgetting his desire to fly, he commenced flying lessons and then transferred the Regular Army to undertake pilot training. In December 2009 he was posted to the 6th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Aviation Regiment
        </a>
        based out of Holsworthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lieutenant Case served his country with honour. His schoolmate at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_College" rel="nofollow">
         Xavier College
        </a>
        said of his friend, 'There was no better person you could have wanting to represent this country.' Lieutenant Case served in a number of overseas deployments, including in Malaysia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , before his final deployment in Afghanistan. But perhaps he will be forever remembered as an angel in the sky, plucking victims to safety during Queensland's flood crisis earlier this year. I echo the words of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        , who said Lieutenant Case was someone who came and gave his all when we needed him. I also wish to express my sincere condolences to the family, friends and girlfriend of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. Lance
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Corporal Jones
        </a>
        has been described as a loyal, reliable and trustworthy bloke, someone who loved his job and was dedicated to serving his country and who also enjoyed a joke with his mates. His family remember him as a dependable yet cheeky character 'whom we will miss with all our hearts'. He served our nation with great distinction, also, with Lieutenant Case, having served in East Timor and Afghanistan. The noble efforts of these two young men and their lives will not be forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I close my contribution in this solemn debate, I want to reflect for a moment on one of the reasons we are in Afghanistan. I spoke earlier of Lieutenant Case's close family and the important role they played in his positive and happy upbringing, and note that he leaves behind two sisters, Jackie and Liz. Before the intervention in Afghanistan, it should be remembered that, under the Taliban regime, girls were not allowed to go to school. Women spent most of their time indoors and all women were forced to wear burkas, covering their heads, faces and bodies. But today, over 2.5 million Afghan women are receiving an education. Afghan women now serve in the country's parliament, they own their own small businesses and they work as teachers, lawyers, community health workers and even prosecutors. These advances in the lives of millions of Afghan women are thanks to the efforts of brave men like Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. Our nation will never forget their sacrifices.

         I rise to express my condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. I also wish to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sergeant Brett Wood and Sapper Rohan Robinson. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         is less than 4,000 metres from here. Etched on its walls are the names of 102,734 men and women who have laid down their lives in the service of our nation. Four more men now join this list and, like the names they join, each of these men has their own story, their own family and their own legacy that they leave behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sergeant Brett Wood lived an extraordinary life. He served across the world, in Bougainville,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         , Iraq and on three tours to Afghanistan. His many decorations speak of his courage, among them the Medal for Gallantry and a posthumously awarded United States Meritorious Service Medal. Brett was a commando, one of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         's most highly trained and important roles. He did that job since 1998. His 13 years in the special forces involved some of the most difficult and dangerous work that Australian forces have been asked to do. According to those who knew him well, he was not one to boast about it. At his funeral his wife, Elvie, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To say Brett was humble is an understatement. He did not want to be defined by his achievements and introduced himself as just an ordinary guy. His most frequent expression was 'no big deal'.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was not an ordinary guy. He will be remembered as a decorated soldier, dedicated to the service of his country, and his death is a big deal for all Australians, as is the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones.
        </p>
        <p>
         The photograph on our television sets and in our newspapers of Lance

         , butcher's knife in hand and sharpening steel across his chest, tells us something very important. The work of our troops is not done just in the fields and in the mountains of Afghanistan; it is also done in the kitchens, the garages, the hospitals and the hangars, as well as at remote forward operating bases like

         </a>
         was killed. That he was taken from us by the actions of a rogue Afghan soldier makes his loss all the more painful and all the more difficult to accept. It is made no easier by the news yesterday of the death of that Afghan soldier who did this terrible act. The commander of Australian forces in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         , Major General Angus Campbell, said: 'Lance Corporal Jones chose...to take the challenge of working in a patrol base and underwent additional weapons and other training to be part of the small, tight-knit teams that support our troops'. He said: 'the efforts of people like Lance Corporal Jones often go unrecognised, but they are much loved and respected for their contribution'. His efforts certainly do not go unrecognised in this place. They are appreciated. His sacrifice is remembered and his service is honoured by us all. In the words of Brigadier Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and bloody great cook,' and he will be remembered as such.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our thoughts are also with the family, the five brothers and sisters and the parents of Lieutenant Marcus Case, who was killed when the Chinook he was in crashed in Afghanistan last month. He was a young man who packed a lot of living into a very short life. Many soldiers aspire to be a special forces commando, some to be an army aviator. Lieutenant Case was both. He served as a commando on his first deployment to East Timor in 2007 and as an aviator on his deployment to Afghanistan. Between those two deployments he was involved in another very important mission; he was part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist in January this year, flying reconnaissance missions across affected areas in a Kiowa helicopter. No wonder his family was so proud of him. At his funeral his brother Chris said, 'We are thankful he was born into our family.' They said he had a heart of gold. He will be remembered as a soldier, a pilot, a mate and a son. We are all grateful for his service and our thoughts remain with his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I take this opportunity to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson. As a sapper, he did one of the toughest jobs in Afghanistan, not only in combat construction, demolition and explosive work, but in all the other work of a soldier. Two weeks ago his unit uncovered one of the largest weapons caches found by the Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces" rel="nofollow">
          Special Forces
         </a>
         in Afghanistan this year. As they moved to the second part of the mission, Sapper Robinson was shot. He was providing covering fire for his mates. At his funeral, his father said, 'He was someone that others looked to when things got tough,' and you can understand why. His unit commander said this about Sapper Robinson:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         He epitomised everything it means to be a special operations engineer … everything that one could be, he personified: bravery, mateship and a willingness to risk one's life so that others may live on. ...
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These were his qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was a brave Australian soldier. He was also a son. I am told that, even while deployed in Afghanistan, Sapper Robinson organised to send his mum flowers on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Mother's Day
         </a>
         . We remember his commitment to his family alongside his commitment to his country. His father made this promise at his funeral:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We will be there every
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Remembrance Day
         </a>
         and Anzac Day to honour you and your fallen mates, 'til the day we die.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sapper Robinson's family will not be alone. As a nation we will pause to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson every Remembrance Day and every Anzac Day, just as we will remember Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Brett Wood and the other 23 who have fallen in Afghanistan whose names are inscribed on our hallowed Wall of Remembrance.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the space of four weeks, the loss of four young Australians forever lost has had an impact. Understandably it has caused some to question why we are in Afghanistan and how long we will remain. In these dark moments it is important to remember why we are in Afghanistan. We are there because it is in our national interest to be there. It is in our national interest to be there because the threat posed by an unstable Afghanistan reaches far beyond its own borders. It affects its neighbours; it affect us. We all remember where we were on September 11. We remember where we were when we heard about the Bali bombings. We also have to remember where these terrible acts were planned and who the men were that planned them. We are one of 48 countries contributing to the same effort under a mandate of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         , and we are all there for the same reason—the threat posed to all countries by an Afghanistan where malign forces can take root again. As I said in the debate about our involvement in Afghanistan last year, we cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia; it does, and because it does it is right that we are there. That is why our troops are there today. That is why their work requires our support in good times and in bad. That is what these men whom we honour today would expect of us. Our responsibility is to be worthy of them and of their sacrifice and to honour their memories with deeds, not just words. Lest we forget.

          I rise to speak to the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. In paying my respects following their deaths, I acknowledge that their loss is supreme. The loss of any soldier is a tragedy, and to have lost two on a single day makes it all the more difficult. I offer my condolences to the families and friends of Lance
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
           Corporal Jones
          </a>
          and Lieutenant Case.
         </p>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
           Lance Corporal Jones

          shares my son's name. His middle name, Gordon, was probably the name I wanted for my son's first name anyway. We are of course not related, but the name Jones is popular; Smith is common. Lance Corporal Jones was described by his family and those in the Defence Force as 'dependable, loyal, with a sense of humour that all who knew him enjoyed'. He took his role as a cook very seriously. He even used family recipes in his quest to provide only the best for his mates. He spent time in Townsville at the mighty 1RAR, and his time there makes his passing all the more personal for me and those in my electorate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lieutenant Marcus Case was a motivated and talented 27-year-old pilot, known for his ability on the rugby field and especially for his love of flying. Those who worked with him spoke admirably of his ambition as an Army pilot, having embraced his new challenge of operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
           RAAF
          </a>
          . The men and women of the 5th
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Aviation Regiment
          </a>
          , C Squadron, in Townsville have spoken to me about the dangers our Army pilots face and the skills they display in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Case's training was not in vain.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both soldiers were widely respected by their superiors and their peers, and they will be missed by their close family and friends. To lose a member of our Defence Force in the circumstances in which we lost Lance Corporal Jones is a travesty and an act of cowardice in the extreme. But we must not forget the important work that was being done by Lance Corporal Jones and others in the Mentoring Task Force in training Afghan soldiers. This role is crucial in creating an Afghanistan that is free of terrorism and for ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become the threat that it is today.
         </p>
         <p>
          Further, I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my support for our role in Afghanistan. Fighting terrorism at its source remains a vital mission in being a responsible player in the international community and, as we continue to make progress, the bravery of our fallen soldiers will not have been in vain. In offering my support to the troops in Afghanistan, I would like to make a special mention of the soldiers deployed there from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
           Lavarack Barracks
          </a>
          in Townsville. I recently had the honour of attending the farewell parade for 2RAR as they prepared for their deployment throughout Afghanistan to undertake their role in training Afghan soldiers and nationals in order to make that country a better place. I know that they have the support of the Townsville community and all Australians. When I say that we are behind our troops, the role that they are playing in helping Afghanistan towards being a better democratic country that values all its citizens equally, regardless of sex, religion or ethnicity, cannot be underestimated. To the family and friends of these brave soldiers: this tragic loss will not be forgotten and it will not be in vain as we continue in our fight against the threat of terrorism. It is cold comfort to any parent that they died bravely. No parent should ever have to bury a child. My heart and the hearts of all the ADF men and women, veterans and the people of Townsville extend to the families of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case our deepest and most sincere sympathies. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget.

          <p>
           Today I rise in this place to express my sympathy at the deaths of two fine Australian soldiers. Firstly, I would like to extend my sympathy at the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and express my condolences to his family. I was privileged to attend the funeral service for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">

           as the acting Minister for Defence in Melbourne just recently. He was described as a dependable yet cheeky character by his family. He was a much loved son, brother and boyfriend who enjoyed his role in the Army and was an excellent soldier.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lance Corporal Andrew Jones was serving with the Force Support Unit when he was tragically killed on Monday, 30 May 2011 Afghanistan time. He was, sadly, shot by an

           has been shot and killed in a coalition special forces operation in Khowst province.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lance Corporal Jones was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1986. He was a young man. He joined the Army in 2004. He completed his initial employment training as a cook and was posted to the catering platoon of the 1st Battalion,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Australian Regiment

           . His was the first operational death in the

           </a>
           catering corps since Vietnam. In 2008 Lance Corporal Jones was posted to the 9th Force Support Battalion and deployed on his first operational deployment,

           </a>
           in Afghanistan in November 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lance Corporal Jones was admired by his mates within his unit not just for his great cooking but for the great soldier and man he was. His dedication to his role as a cook was second to none. I am told that he would always call on all his resources to provide the very best meals for his mates, including using his favourite family recipes. He was 25 at the time of his death—too early for such a vibrant, fun-loving man with so much to live for.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lance Corporal Jones was awarded the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">

           . At his ramp ceremony on Monday, 6 June in Melbourne, Lance Corporal Jones was posthumously presented with the

           As I said, as acting defence minister I was privileged to pay my respects to Lance Corporal Jones at his funeral service. At that service Brigadier David Mulhall, commander of the 17th Combat Services Support Brigade, described Lance Corporal Jones as a true gentleman, kind hearted and decent. Brigadier Mulhall also described the courage of Lance Corporal Jones. He said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Real courage is when you look at your family that you love, which is central to your being, and the girl you have fallen in love with and know that what you do is dangerous and there's a chance you won't come home. That is real courage.
          </p>
          <p>
           On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my support to Lance Corporal Jones's family and friends through this difficult time. I hope they are able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that they are in the thoughts and prayers of so many Australians who are grateful for their loved one's service to our nation. We humbly thank Lance Corporal Jones for his courage, his selflessness and the ultimate sacrifice he has made on our behalf. At this difficult time I also remember the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, who was killed on the same day as Lance Corporal Jones when an Australian Chinook helicopter crashed in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabul_Province" rel="nofollow">
            Zabul Province

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
            Tarin Kowt
           </a>
           . I would like to offer my sympathy at the death of Lieutenant Marcus Case and express my deepest condolences to his parents and brothers and sisters, Robert, Michael, Jackie, Liz and Chris. His loss will be felt by his loved ones the most, but he will also be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lieutenant Marcus Case was born in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1984. He enlisted in the Active
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
            Army Reserve
           </a>
           s in June 2002 and was posted to 5th/6th Royal Victorian Regiment. In 2003 Lieutenant Case commenced the commando selection and training process with 1st
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
            Commando Regiment
           </a>
           , before being posted to 1st Commando Regiment and an operational tour to East Timor. In March 2008, Lieutenant Case transferred to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Regular_Army" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Regular Army
           </a>
           , undertaking pilot training at the Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey. In December 2009 he was posted to the 6th
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
            Aviation Regiment
           </a>
           in Sydney. Lieutenant Case first deployed as an infantryman to Malaysia with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle_Company_Butterworth" rel="nofollow">
            Rifle Company Butterworth
           </a>
           in 2005 and in January 2011 played a pivotal part as the Aviation Battle Group deployed to Queensland to provide assistance as part of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           flood relief operation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lieutenant Case's deployment to Afghanistan commenced in May of this year. He was taking part in a routine Task Force Thunder mission with the Rotary Wing Group when the aircrew of the Australian CH-47D Chinook were forced to make an uncontrolled landing. Lieutenant Case was killed in the incident and five other ADF personnel were wounded. My thoughts, as I am sure yours, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, also remain with the wounded and I wish them a speedy recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over a period of eight years service in the Army, Lieutenant Case has been awarded the Australian Service Medal with Clasp Timor-Leste and the Australian Defence Medal. At his ramp ceremony in Melbourne on 6 June Lieutenant Case was posthumously presented with the Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the NATO ISAF Medal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lieutenant Case was an accomplished Kiowa pilot and was taking on a new challenge of a different kind of flying, operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the Royal Australian
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Air Force
           </a>
           . He was a loyal, reliable and very trusted member of his unit. Though he was quiet and reserved, he enjoyed a joke with his mates and was always the first among them to volunteer when work was required to be done.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also had the opportunity to pay my respects to Lieutenant Case at his funeral service, at which his brother Chris described him as 'a person of many colours and many layers', and one with a heart of gold. His brothers and sisters said that after the first five children their mother and father would keep trying for more until they got it right. They stopped with Marcus. He was described as a larrikin and as a ranga, as a kid who had thought he was born on a pirate ship, and as someone who was destined to become a pilot. As a close-knit family they were comforted to know that in death he was never alone, being accompanied all the way home to his family by a mate in Lieutenant Adrian Wilson.
          </p>
          <p>
           Brigadier Gregory Lawler, Commander of 16th Aviation Brigade, said Lieutenant Case was 'a man with a strong desire to fly, who would get himself into the cockpit no matter what'. The desire and his generosity of spirit was no more evident during Operation Queensland Flood Assist this year. Lieutenant Case was described as 'coming in to work off leave asking what he could do to assist and, as he had no flying clothing, squeezing into a mate's borrowed flying suit'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lieutenant Case has brought honour to our nation, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army and, most especially, his family. He will be honoured by his colleagues. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my prayers and support for Lieutenant Case's family and friends. I offer them my assurance that the sacrifice of this astounding young man, this outstanding young soldier, and all others serving their nation will be forever remembered. We will not forget him or Lance Corporal Jones. Lest we forget.

            soldier and Lieutenant Case in a Chinook helicopter crash, brought to 26 the number of Australian soldiers to tragically lose their lives on the battlefields of Afghanistan. These brave and committed men died defending Australia's security in this distant but critically important conflict. Afghanistan is at the front line in the war on terrorism, and the active service of our men and women in uniform has made and continues to make the lives of millions of Australians that much more safe. It is a sacrifice that a grateful nation will never forget.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lieutenant Case was only 27 years of age. He was based in Sydney with the 6th
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
             Aviation Regiment
            </a>
            . He was born in Melbourne and went to school at Xavier in my electorate of Kooyong. Lieutenant Case enlisted in the active
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
             Army Reserve
            </a>
            in 2002 and was posted to the 5th/6th Battalion,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victoria_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Victoria Regiment
            </a>
            . In 2003, he commenced commando selection and training, which included an operational tour to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
             East Timor
            </a>
            in 2007. He had also been deployed to Malaysia with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle_Company_Butterworth" rel="nofollow">
             Rifle Company Butterworth
            </a>
            in 2005. Most recently, in January 2011, he was part of the ADF's flood relief operation in Queensland. Lieutenant Case, who was tragically killed on his first tour of Afghanistan, had been deployed there as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. I attended the funeral of Lieutenant Case, with both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, at St Bede's Church only a few weeks ago. It was a very moving ceremony, with hundreds of Lieutenant Case's friends and colleagues coming to pay their respects to this very special young man and brilliant aviator.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was clearly much loved by his parents and five siblings. The speeches of his brothers and sisters gave us all an insight into this young man, who drew pictures of helicopters as a young schoolboy and wanted to do his bit to make the world a better place. In the words of his brother Chris: 'He knew his greatest weapon and shield was his mind. We are thankful he was born into our family.' He was also a brilliant sportsman, playing rugby abroad, and was a cherished and close friend to many. He will be sorely missed but will never be forgotten.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, who was 25 years of age, was also from Melbourne and also on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He leaves behind his partner and his loving parents and two younger siblings. After joining the Army in 2004 and training as a cook, he was posted to the 1st Battalion,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Australian Regiment
            </a>
            , later moving to the 9th Force Support Battalion and then deploying to East Timor in 2008. He was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2010.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
             Lance Corporal Jones
            </a>
            was a skilled cook and a respected soldier. In the words of Brigadier David Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and a bloody great cook.' He was known for his selflessness and his commitment to others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan makes for a difficult time for our country, but having recently visited our soldiers in Oruzgan and Kandahar as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation I saw first-hand the important work they are doing in bringing security and stability to this war-torn country. It is a difficult mission, but they are making a real difference. More significantly yesterday, today and tomorrow are difficult times for the Jones and Case families. Their pain is felt by all Australians. We stand ready to support them in every way we can. They need to know that their sacrifice and that of their families is not in vain and will never be forgotten by a grateful nation. Lest we forget.

             I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members who either have or will make a contribution to this very, very important condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. Both died in separate incidents on 30 May this year while on operations in Afghanistan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones was from the 9th Force Support Battalion and was serving with the Force Support Unit in the Chora Valley, an area I know well. It is a shockingly rugged part of the world. He was an Army cook by trade and an Australian soldier by profession, on duty in uniform the day he died. Sadly, he was only 25 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case was a member of the Sydney based 6th
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
              Aviation Regiment
             </a>
             . He began his training as a reservist and deferred his university studies to serve in the Army full-time. He trained as a commando, which is a great achievement, and was deployed to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
              East Timor
             </a>
             . Marcus then trained as a pilot and had deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. He was taking part in a resupply sortie in southern Afghanistan when the helicopter in which he was being carried crashed. Again, very sadly, he was only 27 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did not know either of these very fine Australians but, like all those who have gone before them, it is easy for us to almost feel that we have known them. We know what they were and what they were doing, and we certainly know that they believed in what they were doing. It is a great constant in this conflict, and I am sure in conflicts before it, that while we mourn their lives very deeply we take some comfort, as do their families and their friends, because I have spoken with many of them on previous occasions. We know that they believed in what they were doing, they were committed to what they were doing and they knew all of the risks. Just as importantly, having very sadly attended a number of ramp ceremonies and military funerals, I know their families and loved ones supported them in what they were doing. Generally speaking, although I do not know the families on this occasion, soldiers have the support of their loved ones and their loved ones support what they are doing because they know that that is what they want to be doing. Soldiers who spend so much time training want to put that training into effect, and there is no better way to do so than in defence of their nation's interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are in Afghanistan for important reasons even though there seems to be some doubt in the public mind from time to time. The reality is that failed states pose a risk to countries like Australia and of course we know that many Australians who were killed in places like Bali and Jakarta were killed at the hands of people who had their training in Afghanistan. We have been there too long and we have lost too many young lives, but our mission remains an important one. Like the Prime Minister, I am very, very strongly of the view—as is the

              Chief of the Defence Force
             </a>
             , who spoke quite strongly very recently at a press conference on the occasion of a death—that we need to stay and finish the task we have at hand. That immediate task of course, in addition to the disruption operations of our special forces is to train the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">

             and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Police" rel="nofollow">
              Afghan National Police
             </a>
             to the point at which they are able to take care of their own security. When we have done so we should be in a position to bring our people home with our heads held high.
            </p>
            <p>
             There has been some speculation in recent days, and I suppose effectively confirmed by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_Gates" rel="nofollow">
              Secretary Gates
             </a>
             of the United States that we are now going through a round of negotiations with the insurgents. I used to say when I was minister that there is a very big difference between negotiating with extremists and talking with moderates. The reality is that success in Afghanistan will not come by military means alone. It will only come when we have a political settlement, and of course when we have sufficiently built the systems of governance and effectively built the economic infrastructure that will be required to make Afghanistan what I might describe as a normal country. But finish the job we must. We cannot allow 27 Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan to have given their lives in vain. Again, when I have spoken with families in the past they have asked that of me and us collectively—that is, do not let them down by not finishing the good work they began.
            </p>
            <p>
             I take this opportunity to thank families, friends and loved ones of these two very, very brave Australians for giving us their sons and for the sacrifices their sons made. And, of course, I take this opportunity to extend my own very, very deep sympathy to all those who have been affected by these two very great tragedies.

              I would like to join with previous speakers, former defence minister, and other speakers that have made a contribution on the condolence motions for Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case. When you look at photographs of these two soldiers, there is a temptation that you could view them with the detachment of not having personally known those two men. But as a former member of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Regular_Army" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Regular Army
              </a>
              , I can quite easily imagine the moment when these photographs were taken, and how proud they were of the recent medal presentation I suspect in the case of Lance
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
               Corporal Jones
              </a>
              , and of recently having received his wings in the case of Lieutenant Case. You can also imagine how proud their families were for the achievements that these two fine young soldiers and for what they had done.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you look at the circumstances again, we think of Afghanistan and we think of the circumstances where most of our soldiers have died, under tragic circumstance of course, of improvised explosive devices, or the fire fights that are all part and parcel of armed conflict. When you think of that it is then hard to reconcile the fates of these two soldiers. I know that it was not that long ago, certainly in terms of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
               SAS
              </a>
              's collective memory, that we have lost so many in the tragic
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
               Black Hawk
              </a>
              crash. When we look at the case of Lieutenant Case losing his life in the crash of a Chinook helicopter, and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
               Afghan National Army
              </a>
              soldier that killed
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Corporal_Jones" rel="nofollow">
               Lance Corporal Jones
              </a>
              , these are different circumstances then when you are not actually faced with that two-way fire fight, the improvised explosive device threat. To have lost two soldiers in these circumstances seems even more tragic than in the normal cases. But what I would say is that what we learn from this is that the profession of arms, the wearing of the uniform of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Army
              </a>
              , and in the case of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
               Air Force
              </a>
              and Navy as well, it is a life of risk. It is a life where you open yourself to the possibilities of death and serious injury, and not just through the fire fights. The training, the activities that are undertaken and the way in which combat and military service is prosecuted open people to the risk of the worst case, the supreme sacrifice. So it is the case here. The death of Lance Corporal Jones, brutally and clearly without remorse, being shot down by a person that he thought he could trust, makes that betrayal even worse. And, whilst there might be some comfort for family that it would appear his killer has been brought to ultimate justice with his recent shooting, it is nevertheless a reminder to us of the threats that will always face our people.

They have only ever been a negative influence for the people of Afghanistan—for the children, for the women and for the girls of Afghanistan. They have only ever been negative. As I have said, they have never added value. I suspect that, in the case of the insurgent that killed Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, he was dealt with in the only way that he could have been dealt with in the end, so I certainly thank the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces" rel="nofollow">
               Special Forces

              soldiers that were able to deal with him in the appropriate manner.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Lieutenant Case, Australia is no stranger to our soldiers losing their lives in aviation accidents. We have had the Black Hawk crash in the past that killed so many of our finest SAS soldiers, and we have had other military aviation accidents as well. It is an unfortunate part of operations, and in operating these sorts of aircraft there is a greater level of risk.
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess in many ways it is cold comfort to the families that their loved ones were taken in these circumstances. But we must never forget that they were there in Afghanistan doing what had to be done, and that is what we should be concentrating on. That is what the families should be concentrating on. Regardless of the circumstances, these guys, these soldiers believed in the mission they were a part of and they believed that there will be a better world and a better Afghanistan for the fact that they were there. Despite what happened and despite the way in which they lost their lives, they have done great service for the people of Afghanistan and of course for the national interest of our great country.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I pay tribute to Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and I have paid tribute to Lieutenant Marcus Case. Their lives were not in vain. There will be a better future for the sacrifice they have provided, and I hope that their families have some comfort in the fact that they lost their lives and paid the ultimate sacrifice for a very good cause. I wish their families all the best in the future and I express my condolences.
