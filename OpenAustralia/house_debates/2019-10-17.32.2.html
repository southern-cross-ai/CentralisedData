        in 1971, returned to Fairfield council in 1977 and retired from Fairfield council in 1987. She was active in the

        Mary Horder was a legend in Fairfield. She was a servant of her community and of our party for many, many years. Although she retired from Fairfield council in 1987, which is one year before I joined the Labor Party, I knew her well and respected her service, and I remember her service to the people of Fairfield. Also, it is worth paying our respects to her family—her nine children, her 28 grandchildren and her 48 great-grandchildren—who are gathering at All Saints church in Liverpool today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposition members: Hear, hear!
       </p>
       <p>
        And I'm glad the House joins me in paying my respects to Mary Horder and to her family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Service through council is, of course, a noble cause. It is not the highest profile part of politics, but it is the level of politics closest to the people. Mary Horder was particularly close to the people of Cabravale Ward and the people of Fairfield city. She served her community right up until near the very end. She still lived in my electorate, in Pemulwuy, at the end of her life. I know the members for Fowler and Blaxland join me in paying tribute to a life very well lived.
