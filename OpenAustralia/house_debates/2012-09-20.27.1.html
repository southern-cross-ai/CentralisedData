       <p>
        In 2010 the netball premier league in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        was reduced from 10 teams to six. As a result, the Tango Netball Club, based in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, lost its premier league status and was relegated to the premier league reserves. With its origins dating back to 1947, Tango is one of South Australia's oldest and most successful clubs. Over the years, thousands of netballers have played with the club, and hundreds continue to do so each year. Like good sports, Tango copped the relegation on the chin and set out to prove that it was worthy of reinstatement into the premier league.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an easy challenge and there were setbacks along the way, but several weeks ago the club was notified that it had been reinstated into the premier league from 2013. The determined professional efforts of the committee, with the support of players and supporters, finally won through, and it is a credit to all concerned that the club did not give up or become demoralised. The club is now rightfully back in the league that it belongs in, and with new seniors coach Michelle den Dekker I know that it will prove itself worthy of its reinstatement. My best wishes to the club for the year 2013.
