        <p>
         I thank the member for Banks for his question. As he knows, this program has been extremely well received by local communities right around the nation because it has resulted in jobs being created in the short term based upon local communities’ priorities themselves as expressed through their elected local representatives in local government. It is also building infrastructure that will last for the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, last Friday I had the pleasure of taking the opportunity to open the extensively upgraded Clementson Park at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_Junction" rel="nofollow">
          Bondi Junction
         </a>
         , just around the corner from the electorate office of the member for Wentworth. All up,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverley_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Waverley Council
         </a>
         ’s playground upgrade program received some $340,000. The work undertaken by the council involved an extensive refurbishment of the park and included the construction of a new playground, which will benefit the childcare centre that is just near the park. Further work is taking place at eight other parks around Wentworth.

         mayor, Sally Betts, said:

         Council and our community are very thankful for this funding from the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a very successful launch, which the Liberal mayor, the Liberal deputy mayor and all the Liberal councillors came along to to express their support for economic stimulus on the ground in Wentworth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, himself said, when he attended the launch of the community infrastructure program in his electorate on 26 April:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We have never argued about investing in infrastructure. We support investing in infrastructure …
        </p>
        <p>
         But they have come in here day after day and opposed the infrastructure investment in schools, in local communities, in housing, in insulation. They have opposed the 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan that goes into infrastructure. One thing the Leader of the Opposition has said is that it would not create one job. I say to the member for Wentworth that he should go around the corner from his electorate office, because—

          <p>
           it is not far, as the Deputy Prime Minister says, and because this upgrade alone created work opportunities for 30 people. Thirty people worked on this playground alone. Of course—and the Deputy Prime Minister has tried to explain the way that construction works—they have employed contractors from the private sector. The contractors involved in this upgrade informed us last week that they were ready to make lay-offs. Instead, they kept people employed and, in addition, were able to employ an extra apprentice, giving a young person an opportunity in life.
          </p>
          <p>
           It may well be that the member for Wentworth sees this local contractor as part of the G20 conspiracy of left-wing leaders, part of the

            OECD
           </a>
           —maybe he has become part of that conspiracy at the moment. But the fact of the matter is this: they are arguing the economic stimulus should stop. What they need to do is to identify those projects in their electorates that they think should not occur, because they argue that in here but not when they go back to their electorates. Here is a photo of the member for Wentworth on 26 April at the

            Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. At the beginning of the published standing orders it states that the chair should uphold previous rulings. I would ask you to uphold the previous ruling that those photographs are out of order.

Unfortunately, there was no television footage because matters were not televised. The actual incident involved a scorecard. I understand that those Independents and National Party members might have been inspired—

                            that he had been warned. He knows that when people are coming to the dispatch box, I expect them to be coming to the dispatch box to make a point of order.

He has been named.
