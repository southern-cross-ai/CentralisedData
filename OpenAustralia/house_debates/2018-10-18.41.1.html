        On Saturday, Wentworth residents choose who will represent them in this place. Like many people, I'd rather there wasn't a by-election. But there's a choice to be made about who is going to stand up and advance Australia's interests. Whether they can depends on their experience and their capacity to be able to bring people together. That's why I can think of no better future member for Wentworth than Dave Sharma. I first met Dave at the ambassador's residence in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" rel="nofollow">
         Tel Aviv
        </a>
        . My first impression of him was the same as my impression of him today: What radiates through is his charm, his warmth and his easygoing nature. In addition to his stellar professional and public service, and incredible academic careers, he was unquestionably Australia's most effective ambassador to Israel, because he was able to connect people between business and government to advance Australia's interests. The choice for Wentworth voters this Saturday is not about the past, it's about Australia's future. This is not a time for protest candidates or those who can't work with others. It is a time for someone stable, considered and effective. That's why I support Dave Sharma. A vote for Dave Sharma is a vote for majority government. A vote for Dave Sharma is for a representative who will deliver for his community. A vote for Dave Sharma is a vote for a more successful Australia.
