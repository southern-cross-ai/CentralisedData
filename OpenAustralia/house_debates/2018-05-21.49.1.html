        A member of my community who lives less than 20 kilometres from where I am standing here right now contacted me about the diabolical speeds he currently receives on

         ADSL

       <p>
        Every day I'm contacted by members of my community expressing their disappointment in the dismal rollout of the NBN. Every day someone living in the nation's capital sends me their appalling download speeds. Canberrans are fed up and want to know why the government hasn'tâ€”
