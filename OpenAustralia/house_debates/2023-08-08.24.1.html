       <p>
        Last Friday, I got to do one of my most favourite and cherished duties as an MP: speaking with students about democracy and government. This time I was blessed to speak with grades 5 and 6 at Clyde Creek Primary School's specialist campus in the suburb of Clyde in my electorate of Holt. I was very happy to revive the 'dynamic duo' for the second timeâ€”the wonderful state member for Bass, Jordan Crugnale, and myself. Together, we spoke to students about the duties of state and federal governments and the different things we do for our community.

         The Q

        &amp;A we held was certainly more stimulating than some of the questions put forward by the opposition during question time! The questions were considered and interesting; I almost forgot for a moment that I was talking with grades 5 and 6 students. Thank you to the principal, Jodie Bray, for having me, as well as to all the specialist teaching staff who made the morning such a wonderful success. To all of the students who were there: thank you so much for the high-fives and the laughter. I look forward to being back at Clyde Creek Primary School in the future. I thank the House.
