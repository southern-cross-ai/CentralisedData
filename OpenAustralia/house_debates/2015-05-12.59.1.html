        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Will the minister update the House on the government support for farmers suffering the ongoing effects of drought in Queensland and

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. It was a great privilege to be back in Queensland to announce a further tranche of drought support. It is in fact our third tranche since we have been in government. You have to look at all of these together. In combination, they are rather substantial package. Since we have been in government we have delivered over $23 million for on-farm water infrastructure for low-level bores, piping and troughs. We have delivered another $15.9 million into the GABSI scheme for piping and capping of more substantial bores to make sure that that precious resource continues to be available. We have made available, with the $20 million that we announced on the weekend, over $33 million now for mental health, to support those who are under the pump in dealing with the issue of depression that can happen when a person is under-resourced, the seasons are against them or they are in remote locations. We acknowledge that. We have put substantial money into that.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the $25 million that we announced last week we have now delivered over $33 million for pest control for issues such as wild dogs. In Barcaldine I am aware that they have shot over 850 dogs in the last three years. One dog in one night can kill up to 40 head of sheep. This is a devastating problem which they call surplus kills, where dogs kill not because they are hungry but because it is a thrill for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to farm household allowance, when we came to government, only 367 people were receiving interim farm family payments. We now have more than 4,800 people receiving farm household allowance. In this year alone, which is about to conclude, it is about $70 million in costs. In the forward budget estimates it is going to be a substantial amount. I approximate it will be getting close to half a billion dollars. That is the sort of investment we are making to help people on the land.
        </p>
        <p>
         With respect to concessional loans, when we came to government only eight were given out; we now have more than 530—in fact, we have lent out 531—more than $270 million. In the next 12 months we will extend that program, making available $250 million at concessional rates to keep that program going. We have also made available $35 million for a regional stimulus package. It is not just that; it is the commodity turnaround as well. When we came to government, for a 500-kilogram steer at Gunnedah you got between $700 and $800 a head. Now it is up to $1,500 a head. This is a substantial turnaround. Lambs were $85 when we came to government; they are around $140 now. The eastern wool indicator has gone over 1,200c. I will wait for Thursday night to see Labor's plan, to see whether they have any plan for people on the land.
