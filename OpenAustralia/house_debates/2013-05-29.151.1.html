       <p>
        I have recently met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         East Melbourne
        </a>
        Group, a community organisation who have become concerned about aviation noise in their community. East Melbourne is a beautiful and historic part of Melbourne. It attracts many visitors and the community was motivated to live there because of how peaceful it is. In recent years, however, noise from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in the area has increased substantially. Both news and leisure helicopters now hover over East Melbourne for extended periods at regular intervals. This includes cases of residents having helicopters hovering above their neighbourhood for periods between 20 and 40 minutes with a frequency of every 45 minutes. Furthermore, there has been a marked increase in flights by small fixed-wing aircraft, which I am informed are very noisy when passing low over the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Information from AirServices Australia reflects that in one weekend alone of April this year, 200 flights took place over East Melbourne. Residents recall a time when flights had less of an impact on their community because they flew over waterways and highways. Now residents in the area have told me that flights routinely take place over the area without regard for residents, and their number is growing. These problems have now increased to such a degree that they are causing distress to residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The East Melbourne Group have told me that the noise can be invasive enough to prevent conversations being heard within their homes. Residents also report that the extent of the noise discourages them from spending time outside. The problem is exacerbated because the noise is not confined to certain times of the day, but is described as relentless and ongoing. One resident is woken every morning by a helicopter passing at 10 to six and remains above

        </a>
        for an extended period of time. Others report that hovering over buildings causes the sound to reverberate in a way which is deafening for residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue is clearly one of great concern to the residents of East Melbourne. The community is now collecting a record of locations, frequency of flights and noise levels in order to give an understanding of what this is like for residents. The East Melbourne Group takes no issue with emergency services using the airspace. However, it seems to the group that a balance needs to be achieved between business use and the right of the community to quiet enjoyment of the area. At the moment there is no such balance and as a result residents must endure the constant background noise of aircraft at all hours and throughout the week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to support the community in their efforts to preserve amenity in the area and their right to quiet enjoyment. The community is preparing a petition on this issue, which I will table before the House in due course. I am also in communication with aviation regulators to identify how the problem has become so chronic and what action can be taken to limit harm to the community. I will also be raising the issue with the responsible minister to identify ways this peaceful and historic part of Melbourne can be protected for everyone. I thank the East Melbourne Group for the invitation to their meeting and for their work in preserving the value of this area.
