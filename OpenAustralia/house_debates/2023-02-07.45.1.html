        My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the election the Prime Minister promised he would deliver a $275 cut to power prices, cheaper mortgages, cheaper groceries, and government by renewal, not revolution. Instead, power prices are rising, mortgages are more expensive, inflation continues to climb, and the Treasurer's only answer is to 'remake capitalism'. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?

         I thank the member for her question. And I do say this: we're not on the side of energy bosses; we're on the side of consumers and business when it comes to energy prices. I do say that. And not only do I say that. It's a direct quote from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Treasurer, when standing up supporting action to reduce the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the pressure that's there on inflation, when the New South Wales government, along with every other state and territory government in the country, joined with the federal government last year when we both recalled our respective parliaments to take action. Then, you had to decide whose side you were on. We unashamedly were on the side of consumers, whether it be small business—or large business, for that matter—or manufacturing or consumers. Those opposite voted against that legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I'm asked about energy policy. The energy shadow minister isn't here. He's off in Japan—doing work. I was wondering why he wasn't here yesterday. I thought I might get a question from him. But Ted O'Brien has gone to Japan, and you can pick that out—'Ted O'Brien goes to Japan.' He's been researching his solution. On a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
          YouTube
         </a>
         video that he has put up on his site—and I'm not verballing him at all—it says, 'Time to talk nuclear: what can we learn from Hiroshima?' It's not a complex question. He also visited Fukushima.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here in Australia, this government is working with state and territory governments, Labor and Liberal, to do what we can to alleviate the pressure on prices, and over there the shadow minister is off on this frolic of nuclear energy, even though we know that's the most expensive form of energy possible for Australia.

            The member for Petrie has abused the standing order. I want to be crystal clear. Before Christmas I said that if that happens there will be consequences. The consequence is that you'll leave the chamber under 94(a).

            I want to be very clear with people. I will take points of relevance. They have to be within the standing orders. If they are abused, there will be immediate action. The Prime Minister has 12 seconds remaining in his answer.
