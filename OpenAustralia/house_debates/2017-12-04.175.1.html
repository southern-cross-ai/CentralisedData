        I was delighted yesterday afternoon to join some 500 people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Veneto social club in Bulleen. The social club has been part of the fabric of our local community for more than half a century. The concept of a club focusing on the Veneto region began in April 1966 with a handful of then young men from the Treviso area who had immigrated to Australia. As Jenny Mountstephen has written in
        <i>
         Mr. Pronto
        </i>
        , a story of one of the founders, Dave Barro, the men's idea was quite simple in the beginning: they just wanted to form their own small club and have a clubhouseâ€”a meeting place where those of similar origins could play a game of bocce and share conversation over a glass of wine. A club was subsequently formed and a fundraising appeal soon established. With the assistance then of Sir Billy Sneddon, land was acquired in Bulleen and the now familiar Ermin Smrekar designed building was constructed. Sir Billy opened the new building on 8 December 1973.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, the Veneto Club has grown into a major social, cultural and sporting centre for our local community. It's a tribute to the founders and all those who have worked for the Italian community for these past 50 years. It's also a reminder, I believe, that what matters most in society happens in the space between the individual and the state. Creating, sustaining and protecting the space which is occupied by families, community and civic institutions like the Veneto social club is one of the most important things we can do.
