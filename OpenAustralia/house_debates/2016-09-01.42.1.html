       <p>
        Today I rise to honour the memory of the late Professor Jeffrey Grey, who sadly passed away on 26 July this year at the age of 57. Professor Jeffrey Grey taught military history at the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Academy for almost 30 years. In this role, he taught thousands of cadets and midshipmen military history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff was a gifted writer of history. He published many works, including the definitive
        <i>
         A Military History of Australia
        </i>
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        but I believe his real impact was made on the lives of his students. Today I acknowledge his teaching legacy in this chamber and the service he rendered to this country in equipping many of our leaders in the Australian Defence Force to think deeply, critically and intelligently about war and conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff was a student of war and its consequences, not just for those directly involved in hostilities but also for the societies that send young people to fight on their behalf. Jeff was often a gruff man, but always with a twinkle in his eye, and beneath the exterior was a man who was generous and cared greatly for his students. For Jeff, war had consequences and future leaders had to be intimately aware of them. The Australian Defence Force is stronger because of Professor Jeffrey Grey. His legacy is carried on by the many leaders he taught over his life. I for one will always be thankful for the time he invested in me. To his family, I pass my condolences during this time of grief.
