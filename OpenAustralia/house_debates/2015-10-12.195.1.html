        ( On Saturday 10 October I attended the inaugural Hummingbird House Community Day, which also marked World Hospice Day and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Open_House" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Open House
        </a>
        . Hummingbird House is under construction and will be Queensland's only children's hospice. It is the vision of Gabrielle and Paul Quilliam, constituents of mine in the Brisbane electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having first met Gabrielle and Paul in early 2013, I was inspired by their dedication to making Hummingbird House a reality. I was pleased to lobby for the $5.5 million in Commonwealth funding committed by the current federal government to make this children's respite and hospice service very much a reality. Through their personal journey, Gabrielle and Paul identified the need for support services for parents who have children with life-threatening conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community support and the spirit were unmistakable on Saturday with hundreds of locals attending the community day. Community day provided a fantastic opportunity for those who have been part of the Hummingbird House journey to view the works that are currently being completed and to take a 3D virtual tour of the rooms. Brisbricks even created a Lego model of what the finished house will look like when it is completed in April 2016. Progress is being made on the construction of Hummingbird House every day and the commitment and passion of the local community is evident everywhere to be seen. Congratulations, Gabrielle and Paul and all of the team.
