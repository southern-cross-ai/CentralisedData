        I wish to place on record in the House the very recent passing of a dear and loyal friend, Trevor Wortley, who died on 11 May. He is survived by his wife, Cherie, and sons James and Michael and their families. Quite often through life we are called upon to give our thoughts on the lives of those recently lost. Trevor Wortley was a wonderful person, a role model and a mentor for people right throughout the community. The opportunity to speak on his behalf in the Australian parliament today gives me a very great deal of pleasure.

        , Buderim, was one of the biggest funerals I have ever attended. Trevor was a larger-than-life person. Trevor—like his wife, Cherie, and their families—was a giver, not a taker. I was overwhelmed by the heartfelt condolences that poured out at the funeral. While all of us knew that Trevor Wortley was a wonderful person, we came away from that funeral, which was a celebration of life, appreciating what an outstanding individual he was. I was honoured to lead some prayers at the ceremony, and there were a wide range of government and community representatives there.

        Trevor had a battle with prostate cancer. Although his prognosis was not good, he gave leadership to others with difficult health problems in this area. He put a lot of work into prostate cancer awareness, and he assisted other people. He participated in a trial, and, while ultimately it did not benefit him personally, the experiences that he underwent will no doubt help others facing similar life challenges.

        Examples of Trevor’s community involvement are just too innumerable to mention in the time available. He was very much involved with the Anglican Church and sporting and community groups. Wherever he was, he threw himself wholeheartedly into the community. Trevor’s loss is immense to the

        as a whole, to his wife, Cherie, and to his sons, James and Michael, and his grandchildren. He was a role model. The world is genuinely poorer for the passing of Trevor Wortley. I have to say he was one of the finest individuals I have ever met. He was someone who was just so tremendous. He worked tirelessly and never sought recognition. He was a role model for us all.
