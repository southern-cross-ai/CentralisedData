       <p>
        I would like to draw the attention of the House to a very significant development for residents of Gorton, in particular our local veterans. On 21 February, we saw a slice of local history unfold in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Springs
        </a>
        . The Caroline Springs Returned Services League Sub-branch officially opened its doors, at a moving event which brought together around 200 supporters. As you know, Deputy Speaker Scott, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        is a cornerstone of many communities, and the Caroline Springs RSL Sub-branch joins one of Australia's oldest and most respected national organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have 200 to 300 young service men and women and their families living in Gorton who will benefit from this new facility. The opening was a very well-attended affair. Indeed, it was an uplifting experience for me and for many others who were there. The RSL state president, Major General David McLachlan, AO, officially opened the club. Also, there was material support from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingwood_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Collingwood Football Club
        </a>
        . I pay tribute to them, in particular to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Eade" rel="nofollow">
         Rodney Eade
        </a>
        , who represented them on the day. I do so as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda" rel="nofollow">
         St Kilda
        </a>
        supporter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Caroline Springs sub-branch will be a place of camaraderie and concern, mateship and welfare, loyalty and support. I encourage local residents to continue with their activities or indeed to become more involved. In particular, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the sub-branch's first president, Mr Peter Burquest, and the first vice-president, Mr Murray Lewis. Without the hard work and determination of Murray and Peter, the sub-branch would not have got off the ground. Indeed, they are still surprised by their own efforts. If you knew the dedication they put into this project, you would not be surprised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to joining Murray, Peter and other veterans and their families for the local dawn service to commemorate Anzac Day. I warmly wish Murray, Peter and everyone who played a hand in bringing this club to life all the very best for the future.
