        Last weekend I attended the 10th Pooncarie Field Day. Pooncarie is a little village with a population of about 300 on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        about 140 kilometres from Mildura. This is no ordinary field day—not just because of the breadth of the exhibits but because of the people, the wonderful families from the

        . Patty Byrne, who was there, started the field day 20 years ago as a way of supporting and bringing the communities together during a time of drought. This event does much for the mental health of the people from the back country—people who have strong voices but almost never raise them to complain about their own circumstances. Last weekend we had special guests Jane Bunn, a

        The shearing competition was a highlight—the blade shearers in particular impressing with their skills. It was great to see and experience the Yanco Agricultural Institute demonstrating why they offer a quality rural education. There was the photography, the kids' colouring competition and, always, the friendly atmosphere. Marg White's artistic talent was on display with her funny and beautifully-drawn cards.

        cookbooks demonstrated the versatility and uniqueness of the kitchens out this way, and Gus White was on the mike, bringing it all together.

        Congratulations to the committee—especially to Rachel Strachan, whose determined advocacy for the growers on the Lower Darling and sense of community spirit for her people never fails to touch me.
