       <p>
        I rise to bring to the attention of the House the recent international achievement of the Adelaide Icicle Magic synchronised ice-skating team. Adelaide Icicle Magic recently represented Australia in the Cup of Berlin and the Prague cup. The results the team achieved need to be commended. In the Prague cup, Adelaide Icicle Magic came fifth and in the Cup of Berlin they came fourth. This is a very good result especially as synchronised ice-skating is not a well-publicised and popular sport here in Australia. The majority of teams they were competing against were ones from northern Europe, where ice-skating is a way of life. Adelaide Icicle Magic were the only team in the competition to represent Australia and comprised 17 young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Synchronised ice-skating is a very difficult sport: it requires a group of ice-skaters to skate in unison with each other while looking graceful and remaining in time and completing complex manoeuvres. This is no easy feat. The teamwork, practice and dedication required to achieve this is great. The team trains for long hours at the local ice-rink in Noarlunga and is supported by a number of dedicated parents and other volunteers. Without these volunteers providing the day-to-day organisation and administration of the club, these young people would not have the opportunity to be involved in the sport that they love.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the volunteers that support Adelaide Icicle Magic and also the volunteers at all the other clubs in my electorate, who work tirelessly for very little reward to ensure that young people get the opportunity to participate in team sports. It is important now more that ever, with the problem of childhood obesity, that we encourage children and young adults to participate in sports. It is important for both physical and psychological wellbeing that young people are active and engaged in exercise and sport. This is becoming harder with the attraction of computers and game consoles. The added social element that comes with playing a team sport also can teach young people the valuable life skills of working together. Therefore I would like to express my support for all the clubs in my electorate for the great job they do in supporting young people to be their best.
