        Police Force has been celebrating 100 years of women in policing. Compassion, courage and strength are all qualities displayed by the women in blue and plain clothes that save lives, fight crime and work for the good of the community, particularly in the Hawkesbury and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">

        It was in 1915 when women were first given an opportunity to join what was then known as the New South Wales Police Department. Almost 500 women applied for the two available positions. The two successful applicants, Lillian Armfield and Maude Rhodes, were assigned to deal with matters solely involving the welfare of women and children. They were not issued with a uniform and had to sign an indemnity releasing the department of responsibility for their safety. That is something, I am sure, that would not happen today. In New South Wales in 2015, there are 4,542 female sworn officers and 2,581 unsworn officers who hold positions in the many diverse areas of the force, including the dog unit, the rescue squad, electronic evidence, the mounted unit and detectives.

        To mark the centenary a custom-made baton has been making its way throughout the 76 local area commands across the state. The baton relay reached both the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains last month and the community was involved in the celebrations. I extend my appreciation to all female officers, particularly in the electorate of Macquarie and across the state, who continue to look after the best interests of our community.
