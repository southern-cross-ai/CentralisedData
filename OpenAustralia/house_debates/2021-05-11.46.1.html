        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister please outline to the House how the Morrison government's investment in world-class defence infrastructure, like that she saw in my electorate last week, is promoting regional job opportunities and ensuring that the

         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and I also thank him for being such a champion for northern Australia as well. The Morrison government's $270 billion investment in defence capability is something that we're very proud of. But it's not just about transforming ADF equipment and platform; it's also about empowering defence industry to deliver the infrastructure that the ADF needs to be able to operate and train and also to maintain the new equipment that is delivered by our Australian industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just last week I was delighted to join with the Prime Minister and the very popular member for Leichhardt in Cairns to announce this government's investment of $155 million in investment infrastructure at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Cairns
         </i>
         . I think we all know that Cairns has done it pretty tough during COVID. Its tourism industry has certainly been severely impacted by COVID, so I'm sure that the good people in Cairns and the broader region are thrilled with our investment in HMAS
         <i>
          Cairns
         </i>
         , which will create more jobs in that region. The managing contractor, Watpac Construction, is committed to 80 per cent local contractors in their contract, which is great news, and each one of those contractors will then target 10 per cent participation for Indigenous employment. Again, that's great news for Cairns and the broader region. At its peak, the construction phase is expected to create some 180 new jobs—great news. This, as I said, will create more jobs for the locals, which is good news for Cairns and, of course, critical for our national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queensland will also reap the benefits of a recently announced $53 million investment in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Shoalwater Bay
         </a>
         training area. This is the latest in a series of local contracts which have seen local businesses sharing some $157 million worth of investment from this federal government. I know that's something the local member for Capricornia is very passionate about, so I know that this is good news for her as well. Our investment will deliver some 450 jobs at its peak, meaning more opportunities for local businesses and tradies and professionals that they employ. Just one good example is a company called Bellequip. Bellequip are a local company in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         . They're going to provide a range of earthmoving and civil services critical to delivering the much-needed infrastructure in that region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our investment in HMAS
         <i>
          Cairns
         </i>
         and the Shoalwater Bay training area shows that defence industry in Australia is not just about the shipbuilders or the engineers delivering the ships or the vehicles. The local tradies, the local earthmovers, those locally owned, family building companies—they are just as critical to the defence of our nation. They are important for our major infrastructure projects, and we are incredibly proud of their contribution.
