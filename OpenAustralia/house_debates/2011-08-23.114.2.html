        Mr Speaker, I have sought advice as to why the broadcasting lights were not on during the condolence motion for the fallen soldier. The broadcasting lights came on only when we started question time. I have been informed that, due to a limited industrial dispute, there were not enough broadcasting staff to allow the full broadcast on ABC radio only until question time began, but I believe

        broadcasting ran from two o'clock. I ask: is there something we can do in the future to ensure that such a thing does not occur?

         There are two separate questions. Without implying fault by anybody within the parliamentary departments, I think you have been misinformed. Today was the Senate broadcasting day, and the broadcasting lights, you will notice, are now off. The broadcasting light indicates only that we are recording for the replay of question time. That gets to the gist of the question from the member for Fadden. There is a difficulty for radio in that, because this is the Senate day, the first part of proceedings was not broadcast, and it is not reported, for radio purposes, for re-broadcasting. That may be something the member may wish to take up in the context of the review of broadcasting that we are doing at the moment. The industrial action has caused other difficulties but is not the reason for the problem that the member for Fadden has highlighted.
