       <p>
        Consistency is important in government, and this government has been very consistent—consistent in misleading the people of our communities. Over nine long years of this deceit-filled, scandal-ridden Liberal-National government, our electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        has been misled by a coalition that cares more about announcements than they care about community. For too long, the Lib-Nat government has neglected Melbourne's north. They have failed to follow through on every single commitment they have made for the people of McEwen—always. They give false promises through press releases, and then they move on.
       </p>
       <p>
        After refusing to commit to the Wallan interchange at the last election, they announced with great fanfare in August 2020 that $50 million would be provided for the installation of two south-facing freeway entry and exit ramps from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Highway
        </a>
        to Watson Street, Wallan. This was made under the now infamous and discredited Urban Congestion Fund or the 'car park rorts scheme'. The upgrade was called for by Labor, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Shire
        </a>
        and community groups as urgent, to ensure the safety of our residents and to ease the appalling traffic times experienced by people in our region. The interchange is desperately needed now. Peak-hour traffic is banking up on the Hume Highway from the current Wallan exit, exposing motorists to dangerous cars and trucks, which fly by them at 110 kilometres per hour. It is a serious accident waiting to happen, but the government have never delivered on this promise. In fact, 18 months from their most recent announcement, they are yet to answer to the community on the status of this project. The government claim that the project is in planning but are yet to provide any details. They refuse to be honest with the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government made the announcement, sold the community a pup and, as usual, skipped town. They're like the monorail salesman from
        <i>
         The Simpsons
        </i>
        the way they act—they're all talk and there's no follow through. Our community cannot afford to continue with a government that never delivers. As I said, this government is being consistent—every promise made, every promise broken.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the break I was proud to announce the Labor government will invest $150 million towards McEwen's much-needed infrastructure with our commitment to build the Camerons Lane interchange at Beveridge. The investment will transform Melbourne's north. It will unlock the jobs, the education and community building we need. It's all about unlocking the economic potential of our region. We know this interchange is what's needed to support housing growth and jobs in sectors like education and health.
       </p>
       <p>
        McEwen needs a government that doesn't just make announcements but follows through with them. Only an Albanese Labor government would be willing to invest in the future of our community and provide infrastructure that our electorate needs in order to flourish. We need a government that's on our side, a government that's here for us.
