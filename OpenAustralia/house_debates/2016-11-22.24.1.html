        I take my role as a community representative very seriously. I know that the only way I can represent locals in the federal seat of Petrie is to get out into the community and listen to their needs, feedback and suggestions for us here. Over the weekend, I held a range of mobile offices around my electorate in various suburbs, and I want to thank everyone who came out to see me. Thank you very much for coming out to see me to say hello, to ask a question or to pass on some feedback that you would like me to pass on to members here as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to especially thank Jess and Cheyenne Daia, who made me a beautiful mosaic for my office. Thank you, Jess and Cheyenne. I know you put a lot of work into it, and it is very much appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were a lot of suggestions and issues raised, and I want to let everyone know that I am working on these here. I also want to thank everyone who got in touch with me before the last parliamentary sitting week. To Damon and Chris: thank for raising the issue of bias against fathers in the Family Court system, amongst other things. There was also a lot of feedback from people about ensuring that we focus on Australia. There was talk of homelessness and of looking after veterans and helping them find work, like we need to do as a community for everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have raised these issues with my colleagues, and I look forward to continued feedback. I will let you know when we have actioned these things. I am here to represent people. If you would like me to look into anything in particular, please let me know.
