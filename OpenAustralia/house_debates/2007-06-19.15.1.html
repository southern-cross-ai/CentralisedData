        My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how incidents of workplace bullying and coercion have been reduced by workplace relations reforms? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies that would put these preventative measures at risk?

         I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I thoroughly enjoy visiting his electorate, which has 3.4 per cent unemployment and is certainly a revenue bowl for the nation. As the member for Kalgoorlie knows, the construction industry is very important to the mining industry. That is how we are able to take advantage of the ripe global opportunity and take advantage of the resources boom. Construction is a crucial part of that equation, and the Howard government has got the balance right. When we identified some years ago that there was a level of corruption and thuggery in the building industry, we initiated a royal commission and responded directly by putting in place stronger laws and a fully independent watchdog to ensure that thuggery and corruption were not part and parcel of the building industry in Australia—and our timing was very good.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been a lot of talk today about productivity, and I would like to add my little bit. In fact, I would like to say something about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holland" rel="nofollow">
          John Holland
         </a>
         . A document from John Holland says that Australian workplace agreements are essential for the $90 billion construction sector to achieve further productivity gains of up to 20 per cent. Hang on, the Leader of the Opposition is in this place complaining about low productivity, and his own policies threaten productivity improvements in the construction industry. That is why you have to look carefully at what Labor does, not at what it says. You have to look carefully. That applies in its tough talk with union bosses. We have seen, when it comes to the construction industry, the behaviour of Dean Mighell—the head of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Trades_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Electrical Trades Union
         </a>
         in Victoria—and we all remember the Leader of the Opposition saying, ‘I’m so outraged about Dean Mighell’s behaviour, I am going to have him sacked from the Labor Party.’
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been an eerie silence about the behaviour in

          CFMEU
         </a>
         . Bear in mind that the CFMEU are the single biggest donors to any political party in Australia, and I will give you a hint, Mr Speaker: it is not the Liberal Party, it is not the National Party and—it’s hard to believe—it is not even the Greens. The CFMEU are the biggest bankrollers of the Labor Party in Australia. We saw a report today about the behaviour of the people in the CFMEU, our Labor Party royal family. A report today says, ‘Union men caught on tape heaping abuse on manager’. I am not going to repeat the words that they used on the building site. I think that is unparliamentary and I think we have heard enough of various expletives, even though I can say that our old friend Joe McDonald was calling a builder an expletive thieving parasite dog who would end up working at
