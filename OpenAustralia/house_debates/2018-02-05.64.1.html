        Mr Speaker, there's a space up there in the press gallery. He walked me into the San Remo Hotel. He took me through to the back. He walked me up to the Channel Challenge honour board. There on the Channel Challenge honour board, for 1986: 'M Gordonâ€”competitor, winner'. He won the inaugural Channel Challenge, the sister race to the one he died in on Saturday. Michael's zest for life was inescapably infectious, his loss inescapably immeasurable. He loved this country; he wrote for a kinder, more reasonable and compassionate nation. There was no condemnation in Michael, not even qualified condemnation. He didn't even say to you: 'Look, I disagree with you on this. However, how are you?' No, it was always about you. Ted put it beautifully in

        today: 'He was wise with words, wild in the pool and warm with the world.'

        He was working on a project on

        . It was like he had a new toy, a new opportunity; it was like his first piece ever. His love for Robyn, the kids and little Harry just oozed out of him the whole time. He was an amazing person. He had friends right across this House everywhere. I'm going to miss him and I know all those around him will miss him terribly. He was a fine, fine, fine man and one of the people who have been so grateful and honoured. He honoured me and all of those around him. He honoured this place. He honoured us in his death.
