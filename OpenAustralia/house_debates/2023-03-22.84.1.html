       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. Peter Spillane, an elderly gentleman on a fixed income in my electorate of Herbert has contacted me about the impact of the government's cost-of-living crisis. He told me that he's having to choose between cooking his dinner and turning on his air conditioning because of the spiralling power price increases. Can the Prime Minister inform Mr Spillane when he'll receive the promised $275 cut to his power bill? Why is the Prime Minister so out of touch? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?

         I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and I hope he informed his constituent that he voted against $1½ billion of energy price relief. I hope he also informed his constituent that, when the Queensland government took regulatory action to put a cap on coal prices in order to take pressure off the system, he was also against that, because he voted against cheaper gas prices here in Australia as well, with the cap on gas of $12 that we brought to this parliament. That received the support of the Liberal government in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and the Labor opposition in New South Wales—which is responsible—and the Queensland government. Indeed, it received the unanimous support of every state and territory government around Australia, both Labor and coalition, because they all understood what the circumstances were that we were dealing with.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will continue to take action to take pressure off the cost of living. Tomorrow will be 100 days until cheaper child care comes in. On 1 January, cheaper medicines came in. Fee-free

         is in place already. We know what those opposite would do if they had the chance, if they had to deal with these issues, because we've seen what they've done before. The Leader of the Opposition's biggest idea was a tax on

         visits, which would see the cost of visiting a GP rise by $7. But it wasn't just that. Not only did he not reduce the cost of prescriptions but his big idea was to raise the cost of prescriptions by $5. No wonder he was seen as Australia's worst health minister.

               tax going to be imposed but there was a rise in the cost of prescriptions that was a part of the budget process as well. There's another idea that's been forgotten a little bit that the member for Cook had as well: the government will remove the restrictions on state and territory governments that prevent hospital emergency departments charging a fee for presentation. That was this bloke's idea on cost of living. There are some people in this chamber who mightn't remember that, but I do, and that's exactly what he would do if ever he had the opportunity to have his hand on the budget again.
