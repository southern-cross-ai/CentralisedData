       <p>
        A couple of weeks ago there was a traffic accident on one of the two bridges crossing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalhaven_River" rel="nofollow">
         Shoalhaven River
        </a>
        . It happened in the late afternoon and coincided with the end of a working day with a lot of traffic converging on the bridge heading north. People had finished work and were going home. The Shoalhaven bridge is a traffic pinch point. On either side of the river there is a large urban development. All traffic along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        from Kiama to the Victorian border must converge on this bridge. All freight going to the far South Coast from Sydney must converge on this bridge. If these bridges were to fall in the river tomorrow, traffic would have to be diverted through Goulburn, such is the strategic importance of this river crossing to the economy and future of the communities of the New South Wales South Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day this accident occurred traffic was banked up for two hours within the side streets of Nowra, going back to the southern outskirts of the town. This is not the first time this has happened. The southbound bridge is an old railway bridge converted to a road bridge. Incidentally, the railway line stops on the north bank. It is over 100 years old and reaching the end of its useful life. It, too, will soon need to be replaced. A few years ago a truck struck one of the overhead girders and seriously compromised the integrity of the bridge for many months. Traffic had to be diverted onto the northbound bridge at some considerable inconvenience to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        You only have to think what would happen if accidents occurred simultaneously on both bridges. For quite some considerable time I have been advocating the need for a third river crossing, as indeed has council and most of the community. It is the key to unlock the economic potential for those of the region south of the river who, frankly, are languishing. We had hoped that the construction of main road 92 would act as a stimulus for further infrastructure growth but until the last leg is constructed it remains a fast road with three kilometres of dirt left to do. Over the last two decades the population of the Shoalhaven has grown by about 2,000 people each year, yet the same road network that serviced the community half this size remains. While council has certainly earmarked a third river crossing as a necessity, the urgency has been brought forward and only increases each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the minister for regional development visited the Shoalhaven a few months ago the need to advance the project was firmly reinforced. It is not something that can be paid for out of council rates; it needs serious investment support by the federal government. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        —or Highway 1, as it has been categorised—is a vital arterial route through the south coast. The road infrastructure of this area has long been neglected and I hope that the change of government in New South Wales brings serious reform. It remains to be seen, but it does not divest responsibility on the part of this government to plan effectively and in a timely manner to allow for future growth of a significant region of New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do hope that the minister has taken on board the emphasis that was made in his briefing by council officers. Planning for the third river crossing over the Shoalhaven cannot be further delayed. It must happen now in time for real and effective change to occur. Further procrastination is not an option that our regional economy can afford, nor should have to bear. Not only will the traffic be faster if this happens, with a third river crossing the more free road conditions can only encourage greater traffic movement and more cars, more people and more visitors to the region translate into more congestion.
