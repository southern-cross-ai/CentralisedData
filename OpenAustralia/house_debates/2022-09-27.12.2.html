        It took 1,209 days for the Queensland state Labor government to finally sign a tender for the Port of Bundaberg conveyer projectâ€”that is 1,209 days for a project that was fully funded by the Commonwealth. It's a project that will drive jobs and our local economy. And what do we see? We see, firstly, opposition; secondly, delays; and, thirdly, the member for Bundaberg, the state Labor member, showing up for the sod-turning, turning the sod and claiming the project! It's quite incredible. Imagine that, Madam Deputy Speaker. It's a miracle. There has been an absolute change of heart by state Labor in my local area. They have fought this project, yet they turned the sod on 15 July. Unfortunately, I have to inform the people of my electorate that no work has yet started. So we've waited 1,209 days for a project that then cost an additional $7.7 million because of those delays and increases in construction costs, and what have we seen? We've seen a stunt by state Labor, claiming a project which they were opposed to, didn't want and then delayed. And we still haven't seen the work start. We need this project to get going. It is linking infrastructure to the Bundaberg port. It will mean there'll be more jobs and more activities. There'll be more projects down there. There'll be more companies employing more people from our local region. Yet all we see is inactivity, stunts, and state Labor claiming projects which they've had absolutely nothing to do with. It is disgraceful. The Queensland state Labor government needs to get on with it and get on with it now.
