        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 will increase criminal penalties and introduce new criminal offences and civil penalties for conduct that is unacceptable for live-stock exporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those who obstruct or hinder an accredited veterinarian or an authorised officer, or dishonestly influence any person performing their functions or duties, or exercising powers in relation to an export program, will be penalised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exporters who commit an offence, intending to obtain a commercial advantage over their competitors, or by committing an offence cause economic consequences for Australia, will face penalties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Executive officers who fail to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of certain provisions of the law will also be held personally liable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts will be empowered to make adverse publicity orders, to name and shame those who commit offences or contravene civil penalty provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Infringement notices will also be able to be issued in certain circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        In bringing forward this bill, we will ensure that penalties and sanctions in legislation governing live-stock exports are high enough to provide the level of deterrence and punishment necessary to protect the animals carried on export voyages. We do not want the financial and other penalties to simply be viewed as a 'cost of doing business'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Live-stock exports are a legitimate business option for our farmers and were worth over $1.4 billion in 2016-17. The livelihoods of farmers across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and parts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and Victoria, as well as 1,800 jobs, depend on the live sheep trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are real people with real bills to pay. Any decisions regarding live-stock exports must not be taken lightlyâ€”rather, decisions must be based on science and evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The calls to ban live-stock exports disregard the value of this trade to our farmers and others in rural and regional Australia. Banning, or even suspending, live-stock exports at this time is simply a 'knee-jerk' reaction, and would be a poorly considered decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's amazing how quickly we have forgotten the 2011 suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia and its impacts on farming families. These impacts were felt through the whole supply chain and included businesses that provide transport, mustering, feed and agistment services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has moved quickly to make changes to improve the welfare of our exported livestock. Independent observers were immediately placed on vessels carrying our livestock to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , and three important reviews are being progressed. The government has accepted all recommendations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
         McCarthy
        </a>
        review of sheep exports to Middle East during the northern summer, which was released on 17 May 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        The review of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock and the review into the capability, powers and culture of the independent regulator will be reporting to government in due course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these measures are critical and we will do what is necessary to support our farmers and maintain our reputation as a world leader in good animal welfare practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill is another important part of the government's plan to address animal welfare concerns with livestock exports. We need to ensure that there are appropriate regulatory settings and enforcement tools to provide the right levels of deterrence and punishment. This bill will strengthen measures to deter and punish wrongdoers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the penalties and sanctions available under this bill will not be a concern for livestock exporters who meet their obligations. However, for those that would seek to flout our laws, the full force of those laws will be felt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government supports the farmers who rely on live export, and the exporters who do the right thing. The government is also committed to providing the standards of animal welfare Australians expect. We need this trade to be conducted properly and sustainably.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our farmers, the Australian community more broadly, and our trading partners should have confidence in the livestock export industry. This bill is a step in building that confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
