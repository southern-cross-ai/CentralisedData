        It's been an exciting week in my electorate of Corangamite. After fighting hard for a veterans hub, we're now reaping the rewards. Just last week, alongside the Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I announced a $5.5 million grant to establish a new veterans and families hub. This will benefit more than 6,600 local veterans across the Surf Coast, Bellarine and the wider Geelong region. The hub itself will be centrally located in Geelong and will have major satellite sites—one in Torquay and the other at the Queenscliff

        —servicing both the Bellarine and the Surf Coast. These services will be easily accessible to veterans, will have a focus on financial advice, health and wellbeing and will offer much-needed outreach to veterans, who, at times, miss out on the support they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge all of my local RSL subbranches in Geelong, Torquay,

        , Drysdale and Leopold. You have all played a significant role in this process. From the announcement of Labor's election commitment to the engagement session we held with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs last year, these subbranches have provided feedback and guidance on how we can best support our local veterans. I'd also like to thank the

        The Albanese government is committed to further helping our veterans in the coming months. Only yesterday, the Albanese government released draft legislation which will simplify the century-old veterans entitlements, compensation and rehabilitation system. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        into Defence and Veteran Suicide found the system was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … so complicated that it adversely affects the mental health of some veterans … and can be a contributing factor to suicidality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following consultation, the draft legislation aims to simplify the veteran compensation system, with all claims being considered under a single act. Many of my local veterans asked about this at our announcement, and I'm so proud that we're delivering on this commitment, which will help them to lead more fulfilling lives. I'm looking forward to working with my veterans communities to make sure that this hub is the best it can be.

        I'd like to wish the Torquay Bowls Club a happy 100th birthday. I had the great privilege of sharing in this celebration on the weekend, when members and the community came together to reminisce about times past and recognise the achievements of the club. There were community bowls competitions with the original wooden bowls, a book launch and a documentary film about the club, and everybody got a piece of birthday cake. We heard about the birth of the club way back in 1924 and how it has grown into one of Torquay's most beautiful meeting places. With a magnificent vista across the ocean and to the adjacent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , it's an oasis in the growing town of Torquay. I congratulate the club on its centenary, from current club president, Joe Issell, to the leaders and board members who came before. I also congratulate the many volunteers and supporters who have devoted and continue to devote their heart and soul to the longevity of this historic club.

        It was great to join with the
