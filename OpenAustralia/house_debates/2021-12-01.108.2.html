            , records that those injected twice between the ages of 30 and 79 years of age have a greater chance of having COVID than those not injected, and the title of a recently published study by researchers from the University of California is self-explanatory; it is 'vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar viral loads'. The esteemed virologist Geert Vanden Bossche has warned that such mandates will result in a catastrophe and has stated: 'No healthy individual should be considered more of an infectious threat than another.

             <p>
              With only a few weeks left until Christmas, many Australians are facing a dark and bleak Christmas holiday. They are facing a situation where they will not be able to recommence their jobs. They are facing a situation of being sacked from not only their employment but also their career of choice. This includes nurses. This includes police officers, airline pilots, teachers, truck drivers, disability workers and charity workers. Many of them have already been thrown out of their jobs, denied the freedom that we are blessed with here in Australia to pursue their career of choice, simply for deciding—they have made the decision for themselves—that they do not want to participate in this global vaccine experiment. That should be the free choice that these people have in a democratic society. Standing and sessional orders should be suspended because we here in this parliament have only hours before we will pack up and go on holidays. This parliament will close down over the Christmas break for all of us to enjoy the Christmas holidays and a Christmas break. But we will be denying that break to thousands upon thousands of Australians.
             </p>
             <p>
              We heard only a few hours ago that in the USA a federal judge issued preliminary injunctions against the US President's vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. With this decision, no healthcare worker in all 50 states of the USA can be dismissed from their job for not submitting to a mandatory injection with a COVID genetic vaccine. The judge noted:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              If human nature and history teach us anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risk when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.

             <p>
              The House should bring this on for a debate. If the member for Macarthur has an alternative opinion, let's have the debate, because there are thousands of medical experts with far higher qualifications than the member for Macarthur who have treated far more COVID patients than the member for Macarthur has and have a completely different opinion to the medical bureaucrats of this nation. We deserve to have that debate. There is no single source of truth when this comes about. Mandates forcing Australians to be injected against their free will, using coercion, are unethical, un-Australian and should stop. This parliament has the power to do so. It has the power to reunite our nation, to end the segregation, to end medical discrimination, if it wants to.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is the choice that I wish to put to this parliament that they can vote on immediately.

               <p>
                I second the motion. I'll be very brief. I support this motion because of the heartache that I am hearing and the harm that I'm hearing from my constituents, people who have lost their jobs or are about to lose their jobs, all because they will not be part of, or do not wish to be part of, a provisionally approved medical procedure in this country. It is a provisionally approved medical procedure. There is no denying that fact; it's on the TGA's website. For governments to be saying to people—it is not, I appreciate, the Australian government; it is state governments that are saying it—that they must go and have this medical procedure done in order to keep their job is anathema. It is hurting people—a lot of people.
               </p>
               <p>
                To show the stupidity of it—I mentioned this last night in this place—a psychologist in Mackay who does home consults by telehealth has to be double vaccinated, or she loses her career of 30 years. Tell me: how is COVID going to crawl down the internet and infect one of her patients? It's absurd. But the whole thing is absolutely absurd. It's not just workers who are going to be hurt here. I know of small business owners—cafe owners—who don't want to partake in the medical procedure, and they are going to have to shut their doors. Perhaps even some of them will go bankrupt in Queensland from 17 December.
               </p>
               <p>
                We can do something about it here in this place. We should do something about it. We control the data that comes from the Australian Immunisation Register. It can be flicked off with a switch, and then no-one knows who's vaccinated and who's not. We should have that stance until the people who are imposing this medical segregation actually say they're going to stop it and not harm anyone anymore.
