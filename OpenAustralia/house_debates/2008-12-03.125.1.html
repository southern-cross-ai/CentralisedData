        One of the great privileges of being in this House and being a federal member of parliament is that we get the opportunity to acknowledge people in our communities, whether at our local village fairs, in our schools or here in this place, as the member for Lindsay has just done—and I seek to associate myself with those comments. I am here tonight to acknowledge quite a number of people in my electorate of Cook. My predecessor to the honourable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Baird
        </a>
        started a great program called the Cook Community Awards, and those awards are an opportunity to acknowledge the selfless service of so many in our community who often go unrecognised. Last Saturday week at the Cronulla Sutherland Sharks Leagues Club we had the opportunity to present those awards to more than 40 very worthy recipients, to share with their families and friends their achievements and to celebrate their service. In particular, I would like to mention a few of them for the benefit of the House and to acknowledge their service here in this place.

        This year we initiated a special award: the Cook Community Medal. We singled out one of the many recipients of community awards for their outstanding leadership in community service in the Sutherland Shire, particularly in the electorate of Cook. That inaugural medal was given to Mr Kevin Neilson. Kevin has been a member of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club for many years and was a surf-lifesaving champion in his day. Kevin and Sandra have been a rock of support for the club. In 1966 Kevin became a member of the club and, since then, he has been involved at all levels—most recently, as president of the club during its centenary year.

        There are many of these great heroes in our community, and I know there are in electorates right across the country. There is not enough time for me to talk about all those whom we were able to honour and celebrate on that day, but it was a great privilege to do so. I look forward to receiving the nominations for next year’s event, where, once again, we can celebrate the great community spirit of the shire.
