        I want to recognise the work done by Radiowest announcer Cliff Reeve, and his breakfast show co-hosts, for people affected by cancer, as well as seriously ill children in Bunbury and the South-West. Cliff has been a long-term driver of Give Me 5 for Kids, raising money for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Margaret_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Princess Margaret Hospital
        </a>
        for Children through a rubber ducky race and quiz nights in Bunbury and Busselton. Cliff has been a volunteer at Relay for Life for years. Then, of course, there is Movember, the aim of which is to raise vital funds and awareness for men's health, specifically prostate cancer and male mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cliff has a new partner, Dougie, on his programme
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up" rel="nofollow">
         Wake Up
        </a>
        with Cliff and Dougie. Cliff has brought Dougie on board with volunteering for the Bunbury Relay for Life event and both Cliff and Dougie have grown what I would have to say are less-than-impressive moustaches to raise money for cancer through the Movember approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many reasons Cliff and Dougie are a very important part of life in the small communities and rural and regional areas in and around the South-West. They have done some of their best work in the area of cancer and for children who are seriously ill. Cliff has had a great commitment to Give Me 5 for Kids. In this area he has done an enormous power of work. The power of radio in getting out to people in our community cannot be underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend Cliff Reeve and I commend Dougie for coming on board and helping Cliff in his endeavours.
