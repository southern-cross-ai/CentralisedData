       <p>
        Recently I was lucky enough to visit with Kayaan Katyal and his parents, Varun and Priyanka, in my electorate. I spent time with Varun and Priyanka talking about how our community could stop their family from being deported by the Morrison government to India because, despite Varun and Priyanka having been in Australia for a decade and Kayaan having been born here, the Morrison government is try to deport them because Kayaan was born with cerebral palsy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since I wrote to the immigration minister in February asking him to look at this case with fresh eyes and a human heart, more than 120,000 people have signed a petition asking the government to let them stay in Australia. I'm so proud of the way my community has responded to this horrible injustice. Varun and Priyanka, too, have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support they've received from our community since they told their story, and, having spent time with Kayaan, I can tell you that he is quick to laugh and is great fun to be around. We talked about school and spent a bit of time on that activity that all primary school kids seem to love the most: watching
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        videos.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kayaan's a person. He's not just a cost to be managed by a government. Anyone can see his human dignity in his laugh and in his parents' love for this beautiful little boy. I'll keep fighting for Kayaan, Priyanka and Varun and keep doing everything that I can do to ensure that we can keep them as a valued part of our community.
