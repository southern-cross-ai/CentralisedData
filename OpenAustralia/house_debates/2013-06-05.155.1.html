       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge a number of outstanding Queenslanders who were this week recognised as 'Queensland Greats'. Among them were two people who play an important role in the Ryan community: Dr Dimity Dornan AM and Professor Max Lu.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Dornan is the founder of the Hear and Say Centres for deaf children, based in Auchenflower in my electorate. Dr Dornan is a pioneer in her field, and her resolve to find an auditory-verbal solution for deaf children has led to a number of world firsts, including providing the world's first comprehensive training for teaching professionals in auditory-verbal therapy and creating the world's first

         AVT
        </a>
        e-learning model for service delivery. Dr Dornan plays a significant role in raising the profile of hearing health throughout Queensland, Australia and the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Max Lu is an engineer of international standing whose contributions to Queensland and world science are leaving a powerful legacy. Professor Lu is an accomplished leader at the University of Queensland in Ryan and has spearheaded one of Australia's premier research centres, the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Functional Nanomaterials. Throughout his career, Professor Lu has mentored more than 100 next generation researchers and has co-authored more than 500 publications and 20 patents, achieving the elite scientist status of 'highly cited researcher' from the Institute for Scientific Informationâ€”top 0.1 per cent in the world.

        I would also like to recognise legendary Brisbane businessman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ackerie" rel="nofollow">
         Stefan Ackerie
        </a>
        , another 2013 'Queensland Great'. His commitment to educating young people both in life skills and hairdressing over the last 47 years has seen thousands of young Queenslanders employed under the Stefan rainbow and realising their career dreams. Mr Ackerie is also known for his generosity and charity work to support the homeless, the needy and sick children in hospitals all over Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businessman, pastoralist and philanthropist Tim Fairfax AM was also named as a 2013 'Queensland Great'. Mr Fairfax is well known for his philanthropy and leadership within the arts, particularly in association with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Art_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Art Gallery
        </a>
        's Gallery of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Art" rel="nofollow">
         Modern Art
        </a>
        . Through the Tim Fairfax Family Foundation, his generosity and commitment have enriched the Queensland Art Gallery collection. Mr Fairfax has also played a critical role in realising many of the initiatives of the Queensland Art Gallery's Children's Art Centre by running children's programs through regional and remote Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another 2013 'Queensland Great', the Australian Red Cross Society, was recognised for helping Queenslanders to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, particularly in the wake of ex-tropical cyclone Oswald, when the organisation managed 18 evacuation centres and supported more than 36,000 people. The society was established in 1914. It is one of the largest and most respected humanitarian organisations in Queensland. The organisation currently has more than 75 town branches, over 2,500 members and more than 6,000 volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to this year's 'Queensland Greats' and thank you for the real and positive difference you make in our community. On that note, can I say 'go the mighty Maroons tonight.'
