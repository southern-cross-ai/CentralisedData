       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Federal Police's property portfolio is a key enabler of the Federal Police's capabilities, enhancing the organisation's readiness, capacity and ability to carry out its responsibilities for law enforcement, investigations and national security.

        A recent vulnerability assessment determined that eight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        facilities were high-risk and required strengthening to reduce the threat of unauthorised access. As a result, the AFP proposes to undertake refurbishment and construction works on owned and leased premises. Refurbishment and construction works will focus on improvised explosive device protection, intruder resistance protection and system response capability. Providing secure facilities is a critical component of property being an enabler for the AFP to deliver its services at a level expected by the Australian government.

       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a rigorous and timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence in February 2017 and to be completed by December 2017. I commend the motion to the House.

        's electronic warfare capabilities in the land and maritime environments up to a level that is commensurate with current air electronic warfare capabilities. The proposed facilities will help to ensure Defence Force platforms fitted with electronic warfare systems can achieve and maintain battle worthy capabilities. The project works include various laboratories, workshop preparation areas, information facilities, meeting rooms, offices, breakout areas, amenities, equipment hardstand areas and car parks.

       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct new and refurbished facilities and infrastructure to support the introduction, operation and deployment of the new Australian Defence Force artillery capability at eight Defence locations across Australia.

        In its report, the committee has made a recommendation in relation to contamination issues and has requested that Defence provide regular updates to the committee regarding the containment and management of contaminated areas and to also keep the community informed. Defence acknowledges the recommendations of the committee and will implement them to the extent that it does not compromise Defence operations and security.

        The Department of Defence is proposing to deliver new and refurbished facilities and infrastructure that are capable of facilitating the operation of a new range for safety and control system at the Woomera Range Complex in South Australia. The project will provide purpose-built facilities that will enable more frequent and more sophisticated trials in support of future testing and evaluation of air platforms and weapons. The project also proposes to upgrade and establish new communication sites on the range that will be supported with road upgrades and the expansion of a fibre optic network. The works will provide the Australian Defence Force with purpose-built facilities to support the introduction into service of a new, state-of-the-art, integrated range control system at the Woomera Range Complex in South Australia.
