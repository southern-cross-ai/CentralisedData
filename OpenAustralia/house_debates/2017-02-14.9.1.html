       <p>
        Last Friday night I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Berry's annual Riverland and Mallee Vocational Awards. These awards are the largest of their kind in regional Australia, which underscores not only the hard work of the apprentices, trainees and students but also the dedication of members of the Rotary Club of Berry and the quality of the training experiences offered by employers in the Riverland and surrounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apprenticeships and traineeships are a highly effective way to skill Australians to be part of the modern, rapidly changing workplace. Apprentices and trainees gain valuable skills which project them on to lucrative career pathways. Nationally, employment outcomes for trade apprentices, in particular, are strong, with over 90 per cent of graduates remaining employed after completion of their training. There is no doubt that an apprenticeship or a traineeship provides a strong foundation for a highly successful and fulfilling career. Recognition must also go to employers in the region who not only contribute to their profession and the local economy by employing a trainee or apprentice, but also provide much appreciated guidance, education and training for the young people they take on.
       </p>

        Again, congratulations to all nominees and well done to the finalists and, of course, the winners: Erica Austria, winner of the
