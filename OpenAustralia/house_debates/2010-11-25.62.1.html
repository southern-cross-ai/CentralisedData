        I rise to speak on behalf of the Townsville community, the people of Herbert and North Queensland Community Transport. North Queensland Community Transport provides assistance to get to and from hospital appointments, shopping and anything around town for people who cannot afford a taxi or where there is no public transport. It is a membership based organisation. The drivers are all volunteers. They do not have to have a first aid certificate but North Queensland Community Transport likes them to. The organisation is not in a position to pay for them all so we have just done a fundraising drive for them. They had 30 drivers to get through. When the Brothers Leagues Club, the Cowboys Leagues Club and the Townsville
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        heard there were 30 people to go through they said they would pay for the lot. We also have a list of about 25 businesses in Townsville who will go on a roster so that every time a new driver comes on, that driver will have their first aid certificate paid for on behalf of North Queensland Community Transport. It is a great organisation and they are fantastic, driven people.

        The volunteers who work for them do all sorts of hours with a smile on their face. There is nothing they will not do for their members. It is a great thing. They do a lot of work and take the pressure off the

        . The Brothers Leagues Club, the Cowboys Leagues Club and the Townsville RSL just came to the party with one quick phone call and said, ‘We will pay for the lot.’ On behalf of the people of Townsville, I say thank you very much.
