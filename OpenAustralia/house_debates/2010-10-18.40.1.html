        On 22 September 2010, I attended the Millen Primary School, in my electorate of Swan. The purpose of the visit was to present a certificate to the school as it is in the running to be named the WA Super Site. The Super Site award recognises the outstanding contribution that schools and after-school care centres make towards getting children and the community active through the Active After School Communities program. The

        program is run successfully at around 3,200 sites across the country, including Swan. In term 3, awards are presented to outstanding coaches and to primary schools and after-school care centres to recognise and celebrate their achievements in delivering the AASC program. The AASC program is a free Australian government initiative delivered nationally by the Australian Sports Commission. The program was initiated by the Howard government and I congratulate the current government for continuing the program. The program provides primary school children with the opportunity to experience more than 70 different sports and up to 20 other structured physical activities. Within the electorate of Swan the AASC program has encouraged more than 900 children to be engaged in sport and other structured physical activity, engaged 18 primary schools and after-school care centres in the AASC program and trained more than 80 community coaches including teachers, volunteers and local club personnel. Importantly, this program initiated during the Howard government is increasing the community’s capacity to deliver sport and other structured physical activity. I congratulate Millen Primary School on being named as one of the schools in the running to be named WA’s Super Site.
