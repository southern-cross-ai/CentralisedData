        I rise today to speak about Oran Park Smart Work Hub, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government pilot program operating in my electorate of Macarthur. Oran Park Smart Work Hub offers residents an alternative work location closer to home, supporting flexible work practices and promoting the sharing of ideas and resources. Last week I was fortunate enough to be given a tour of Oran Park Smart Work Hub by Becky Pascoe, who was a delightful host. Beccy's role as Hub Host is to make members feel comfortable and create a sense of community around the hub. Beccy inducts and facilitates members into the hub as well as looks after business development and marketing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hub aims to help grow knowledge-based industries, providing space for workers from different organisations to connect with one another. Amy Woodley, from Start Fresh Accounting, has been part of the Oran Park Smart Work Hub since November 2014. For Amy, the hub has provided an office space to grow her business without requiring a commercial lease, which offers her the peace of mind of having a more flexible financial arrangement so that she can concentrate on the things that matter to her business. The Smart Work Hub provide a professional and positive work environment for Amy other like-minded business owners and entrepreneurs to network with one another.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of the Oran Park Smart Work Hub can avoid the stress of a long commute to work and offers the flexibility to schedule that doctor's appointment, school event or special family occasion that can be disruptive to running a business. Oran Park Smart Work Hub is of incredible benefit to our community. I look forward to seeing new and exciting companies emerge from this fantastic program.
