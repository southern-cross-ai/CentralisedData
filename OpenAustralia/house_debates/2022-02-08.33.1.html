        Today, I'm making a big shout-out to Wendy Cox, who runs the Graceville Fine Foods &amp; Deli, and her team. Everyone in Graceville knows Wendy. Last year, she received a Moreton Volunteers Award for the support she provided to my local community during the first year of the pandemic. Wendy needs a new award this year because Wendy and her team just keep on going. Wendy started the 'Thank you Nurse!' campaign, making delicious dishes for the nurses working in Brisbane's COVID wards. My mum, Peggy Perrett, was a nurse, so I know the long hours that they work, the care they give to patients, the sacrifice they make in being away from their families and, often during a pandemic, putting themselves in harm's way. So anyone who's supporting nurses is No. 1 in my book.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 'Thank you Nurse!' campaign is a community supported enterprise of love. Locals have donated funds to buy food, and the cooking and delivery is done by Wendy, her chef and the deli staff and volunteers. While this pandemic has taken a terrible toll on our medical staff—people working day in and day out to keep people alive, sometimes particularly those unvaccinated—it has also shown us the generosity and community spirit many have in their hearts. Well done, Wendy. Well done to Chef Gareth, Tory and the rest of the staff at Graceville Fine Foods &amp; Deli. I've been going there for nearly 30 years. I know that they will keep making life a bit brighter for our wonderful nurses. Let's see if we can get another award for Wendy and her team at Graceville Fine Foods &amp; Deli.
