        On 1 August I went down to the Shopfront Arts Co-Op in Carlton, which is a phenomenal organisation in the St George area and a tremendous arts community hub. There are theatrical performances there. There are lots of classes for kids. Various musical events take place there. It's a terrific institution in our community. It's been there since 1977. It was great to meet with Daniel Potter, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , and Cathy Nisbet, who is now the development manager, having moved from Kogarah Community Services. I'm really pleased that, as a government, we've been able to assist Shopfront with its important work, through grants through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        and a substantial contribution to the big redevelopment and renovation that's going on down there at Shopfront at the moment, which is going to create the best performing arts space in the St George area, certainly. It's a terrific organisation, and I want to thank Daniel Potter for everything he does, including judging the annual Banks Junior Short Film Contest. Shopfront is a great organisation, and I am always pleased to visit and do everything that we sensibly can to assist.

        On 3 August I attended the Oatley 101
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Artists" rel="nofollow">

        annual members' exhibition.

        Sitting suspended from 16:17 to 16:36
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the suspension, I was saying the Oatley 101 Society of Artists does fantastic work. It was great to visit the exhibition on 3 August. In particular, I'd like to thank President Geraldine Taylor, who does so much work for Oatley 101. I'd also like to thank Vice-President Jill Hamilton, Secretary Robyn Riley, Treasurer Freda Surgenor and the entire committee. It was great to see Ian Hansen there, one of Australia's most accomplished marine artists To have Mr Hansen there judging the local artwork was tremendous for Oatley 101 and a really great endorsement for our local artists. Thank you again to Oatley 101.

        On 3 August, I visited Padstow Probus Club. I like to get down to Padstow Probus Club as often as I can. It's a terrific organisation, thanks to President Roy Barnes, Senior-Vice President Kerry Maynell, Senior Vice-President Saijad Versi, Secretary Valerie Isaacs and previous president Graeme Rutter, amongst many others. There are 135 active members at Padstow Probus, and there's a waiting list as well. That is a reflection of what a great group of people it is. There's so much activity, lots of outings and even overseas trips from Padstow Probus. They are putting so much back into Padstow. It's been around since 2004. May it exist for many decades to come. Thanks to everyone at Padstow Probus.
