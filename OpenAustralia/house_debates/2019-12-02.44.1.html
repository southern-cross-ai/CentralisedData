       <p>
        Last month, I was proud to attend the 50th anniversary of Melbourne's first mosque, in Carlton. Albanian Australian Islamic Society hosted a lively festival on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummond_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Drummond Street
        </a>
        , which was closed off so that the food trucks and stalls could be rolled in, accompanied by a jumping castle that kept my kids and many others happy. I was also happy to present a plaque to the mosque with my colleague the state member for Melbourne, Ellen Sandell, congratulating and thanking the AAIS for their service to the community. I was proud and moved to witness the first ever Adhaan, or call to prayer, from the mosque's minaret. It was a humbling moment demonstrating everything that I love about Melbourne. This mosque, which for 50 years has stood alongside heritage listed Victorian cottages that are up the road from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygon_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Lygon Street
        </a>
        and around the corner from churches, coffee shops and parks, is one of the many institutions that make Melbourne the culturally rich and diverse epicentre I am honoured to represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to pass on my thanks and congratulations to the key volunteers involved in making the day such a success: the AAIS president, Urim Balla; youth community member, Iman Balla; the Iman, Dr Bekim Hassan; 50th anniversary organisational committee members, Bari Nuhiji, Rami Kulafi and Indira Kulafi; and all the event subcommittee volunteers. I congratulate the AAIS again on this anniversary and thank them for hosting me. Although I don't think I'll be in parliament for the 100th anniversary of the mosque, I hope the Greens MP for Melbourne in 2069 will be as proud to attend as I was.
