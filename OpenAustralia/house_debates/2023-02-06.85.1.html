            He said:

           <p class="italic">
            … I regard it as going beyond the bounds of our sub judice rules if the honourable gentleman puts any construction on the matter for the simple reason that if the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Commission
            </a>
            er in fact concluded in a way which was consistent with the honourable gentleman's construction it may appear that the Commissioner was influenced …
           </p>
           <p>
            So this is a very important issue, which has been considered by previous speakers. We have seen the minister who's about to come to the dispatch box trample over this important distinction before, and I urge you to consider this carefully.

              In considering it, as has been asked by the Manager of Opposition Business, I'd just refer to
              <i>
               Practice
              </i>
              , where it's really clear that royal commissions are allowed to be asked about. If you look at royal commissions that were held during the life of the previous government, a very different argument was being put back then. There is a long-held precedent on being able to deal with royal commissions.

                The question is not whether royal commissions are entitled to be asked about. The question is: what are the guardrails that should be put around what is said about them? That is the point that Speaker Snedden was going to, because it goes to the question of whether there is an appearance of the royal commissioner's findings being influenced.

                 I had a feeling this subject would be raised and I want to give some direction to the House because I'm sure there will be further questions on this matter. As a first principle:

                 The application of the sub judice convention is subject to the discretion of the Chair at all times.

                 </i>
                 . I'm going to refer to former Speaker Smith, who noted in relation to comment in proceedings about a royal commission:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 … it would be a ridiculous restriction of debate if matters that have been raised in public and reported in the media could not be aired in the national parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will be listening to the minister carefully, but that is the direction I'll be following, and I refer members to

                  HORTEN (—) (): So far, with the royal commission into robodebt, we've seen a perp walk of former coalition ministers who were, at different times, responsible for the design, the implementation and the administration of this unlawful scheme. Last week we heard from the former human services minister, the member for Aston. During his evidence to the commission, the member for Aston—

                        During his evidence to the commission, the member for Aston acknowledged that (1) he was responsible for the administration of the robodebt scheme between February 2016 and December 2017, (2) he knew that robodebt produced inaccurate debt notices, (3) he did not think to raise questions about the legality of the scheme for the duration of his time as the minister, (4) he requested the personal files of 52 Centrelink recipients who had complained in the media in the period between Christmas 2016 and January 2017, and (5) he did think, however, to get legal advice about accessing the personal files of the 52 public complainants, as opposed to seeking advice as to the lawfulness of the whole scheme. The member for Aston did pay forensic attention to people complaining about the scheme but never the complaints. He investigated the messengers but never the message. Furthermore, when the minister was asked about his responsibility, he shifted responsibility for the scheme to the former Prime Minister, former Treasurer and former finance minister for prioritising and finding savings. He also shifted responsibility for not understanding the illegality of the scheme to senior public servants, one of whom is now deceased. Further, he said that he had no visibility of the scheme—

                          Mr Speaker, the standing orders are very clear. Standing order 90 states: 'All imputations of improper motives to a Member … shall be considered highly disorderly.' We've just had a series of character assessments from the minister. This is a clear breach of the standing orders.

If he strays from that point, he will be pulled into order. I give him the call.

                            . He made it clear that he blamed the senior public servants. It wasn't his fault that he didn't know about the illegality.

The human blame factory here also blamed the complainants of the scheme.
