       <p>
        Today is World Stroke Day, which is an ideal opportunity to increase the awareness of stroke and highlight how we can recognise and remember the signs of stroke. Stoke is an interruption to the blood flow to the brain, which then prevents that section of the brain from receiving a continuing supply of oxygen, which in turn damages that section of the brain itself, preventing it from controlling the particular area’s body function. Stroke is Australia’s second-biggest killer and a leading cause of disability which costs the health system approximately $2.14 billion each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The theme for World Stroke Day 2009 is ‘Stroke, what can I do?’ This is an important question as 60,000 strokes are expected to occur in Australia in 2009—one in every 10 minutes. The theme has been developed to encourage everybody in the community—individuals, groups and governments—to take action against strokes. Lives can be saved by learning the signs, knowing what can cause a stroke and what can be done to reduce the possibility of a stroke. So today in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        you can assess your risk by getting your blood pressure checked, and I would encourage all members to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also take this opportunity to mention the efforts of the Bunbury and Districts Stroke Support Group within my electorate of Forrest. The group provides important and very much appreciated service and support, helping stroke survivors regain self-confidence and fills the need for carers, family and friends to learn about adapting to the new situation that arises after strokes. The group achieves this by sharing experiences, learning how others cope with various problems, actively helping each other and making each other laugh—so important. I endorse the work of the Bunbury and Districts Stroke Support Group in support of World Stroke Day, which urges everyone, including members of this House, to take personal action to reduce the devastating impact of strokes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this last minute to recognise a very dear friend and wonderful community person in my electorate Jenny Fry, who suffered a stroke in recent times. Jenny, a very articulate, confident person, very active, has had to deal with a number of challenges in recent months. She has done this with extreme dignity. She has taken this, as she does with everything, full on. She is giving it her best shot and she is really working overtime to try to manage the effects. She can no longer articulate; she is incredibly frustrated by the fact that she cannot articulate the thoughts in her mind and make them come out in the way that she intends. She is a very brave woman. I encourage her and her husband, Peter, and all of those not only in my electorate, but around Australia who have and will suffer stroke, the very best of support in your efforts to regain your quality of life after you have suffered a stroke.
