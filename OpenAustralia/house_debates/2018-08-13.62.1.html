        In a few minutes, my friend Susan Lamb is going to walk in here with some other people and be sworn in as the member for Longman. I'm very happy to see that—someone that personifies Labor values more than almost anyone else in the chamber.

        </a>
        should be placed last on all Liberal Party how-to-vote cards in Australia.' And just last year, Senator Ron Boswell, someone who knows a little bit about Queensland politics, warned against swapping preferences with One Nation.
