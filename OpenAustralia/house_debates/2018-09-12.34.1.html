        I rise this morning ahead of R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day, which this year falls tomorrow. R U OK? Day is a national day of action. It's held each year to remind people to ask those around them—their friends, their family, their work colleagues, their neighbours—the simple question: 'Are you okay?' It's a small question, a very simple question, but it can mean a lot to someone who might be struggling. It's not just about the question; it's about the conversation that it starts. It gives people an opportunity to talk about what might be weighing on their mind and about strategies to better manage the load. It gives the asker an opportunity to really listen and, importantly, it gives people an opportunity to ask for support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I visited a school in my community, St Eugene's at Burpengary, where years 6 and 7 students made an important link between R U OK? Day and the mental health issues that drought-stricken farmers have been enduring in recent times. While I was there, we discussed the issues that farmers are facing, the impact the drought is having on some farmers' mental health and the strategies to help them get back on their feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also presented with letters from a number of the students that I met, like Khiana in year 6 and Sarah in year 7. They outlined their concerns and proposed some really good policy ideas to ease the pressures caused by the drought. In some of their letters, like Ilkut's or Jackson's that I have here, the students asked me to take their message to Canberra so they can have their voices heard. True to my word, I have done exactly that: I have their letters right here with me. I raised some of the issues in these letters with my parliamentary colleagues and I intend to discuss them with shadow ministers who can consider some of the messages and some of the proposals that these students have written.
       </p>
       <p>
        In one of these letters, Sofie, from grade 6, noted that her grade will be here in Canberra tomorrow for R U OK? Day. Sofie, I'm hoping to meet you and your friends from St Eugene's tomorrow so I can directly hear from you what you think we, as politicians, should be doing, what the Australian parliament should be doing. I know that, as young people, it can sometimes feel like your voices aren't being heard, but I will say to you, your friends and all of the other young people in Longman: I want you to know that I'm listening. I'm listening. I want to hear from you, and I'm really looking forward to hearing from the St Eugene students here tomorrow in
