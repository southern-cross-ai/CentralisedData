        (6) In making an attestation in accordance with paragraph Error! Reference source not found., a Member may provide supplementary material.

        (10) If a Member becomes aware of circumstances that give rise to a possible disqualification under sections 44 or 45, arising from facts not disclosed in accordance with Part XIV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Member may provide a statement of those circumstances to the Speaker. Any material redacted from the material entered onto the Register, including redactions from documents tabled on behalf of the Australian Electoral Commission is taken not to have been disclosed.

       <p class="italic">
        (14) When a question respecting a Member's qualification turns solely upon the interpretation or application of foreign citizenship law, the committee shall not recommend that the question be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns unless the committee has taken evidence from experts in the relevant foreign law and the committee considers there is a sufficient possibility that the Member was a foreign citizen under the relevant foreign law at the relevant time.

After the committee has made such a report, a Member may, without notice, move to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns.

       <p>
        This motion was developed in response to a proposal from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their 2018 report titled
        <i>
         Excluded: the impact of section 44 on Australian democracy
        </i>
        . I want to thank, from the outset, the opposition, the parliament, members of the government and members of the committee who worked on this report to ensure that we had a bipartisan arrangement in relation to improvements in the law and improvements to our standing orders here and in the Senate in relation to the administration of section 44 under the Constitution and in the requirements of the electoral processes to ensure that we get a better outcome for the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The joint standing committee proposed that, in addition to legislative changes to require federal election candidates to disclose information about their eligibility to hold office under the Constitution, the House and the Senate also needed to adopt complementary parliamentary processes related to the issues of constitutional qualifications. I think any member that reflected on the passage of events in the last parliament that we've had would agree that there would be a need for improvement related to the issues of constitutional qualification procedures within our chambers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although interim motions were adopted to deal with these issues in each chamber, this replacement motion that I'm proposing today on behalf of the government was developed with the benefit of greater time. It deals more comprehensively with the eligibility issues and ensures greater alignment between the practices of both the House and the Senate to ensure fairness of treatment to all members and senators. A parallel motion, I note, was adopted in the Senate yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion does two things. The motion establishes a process to require public disclosure following discovery of new information after an election. Given that the electoral requirements for nominations now, as the parliament's laws have made clear, require disclosure of section 44 information up-front and transparently on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
         AEC
        </a>
        's website, any new information will be required to be brought forward under this motion to the parliament in an orderly process with the cooperation of members and the Speaker. It's also fair and proposes a fair and orderly process for making referrals to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. Members will note that, given the lack of clarity about the procedures for making referrals to the High Court from this chamber, this motion will adopt a standing order change which will allow us to make an orderly referral and ensure there is clarity in future situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        motion differs from the House motion in one regard: to provide procedures for disclosures by senators who are appointed to fill casual vacancies. Obviously, this is not relevant for members elected via by-elections as they can make their initial disclosures about their qualifications via the Australian Electoral Commission. As per the procedure with a general election, in a by-election candidates will be required to lodge the same information that a lower house candidate will have to nominate at a general election. The motions have bipartisan support, as I've stated. They've been shared with the chairs of the parliamentary committees. They would have roles in administering these motions. They include the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the motion to the House and simply record again thanks to the opposition, the parliament, the Senate, the chairs and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is important that, at this juncture, we provide clarity to members, with an upcoming election at an imminent time, that we understand and know the procedures. We listened to the outcomes of the High Court cases that have made clear the High Court's view on section 44, and I can say confidently to the Australian people, to the gallery and to the parliament that this government has listened very carefully and has moved to adopt modern and relevant changes to the law surrounding nominations regarding section 44, and the motions that change standing orders in our House will also provide clarity to members in future parliaments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
