        6 MS SHARKIE: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that the regulation of retirement villages in Australia is highly complex and varies significantly between states and territories;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that retirement village fees can include upfront incoming payments, ongoing service charges, and exit or deferred management fees, the latter of which may equate up to 25 to 40 per cent of the resident's ingoing contribution or resale price;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further recognises that while these fees are of a quantum which may apply to a prospective resident when purchasing a property freehold, most retirement villages offer only loan/license agreements or leasehold or similar agreements, which do not provide comparable security of tenure nor other rights;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) expresses concern that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) negotiating and understanding a lengthy and complex retirement village contract can be difficult for some prospective residents; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the fees charged place some residents in financial hardship when they depart, such that they may not be able to afford a higher level of care if needed subsequently;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to recognise that many retirement village contracts represent a financial product, and therefore warrant federal oversight and regulation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) further calls on the Government to work with the states and territories on national reforms for the harmonisation of retirement village regulation regimes such that:

        (a) improved consumer protections and increased transparency and consistency are provided for all Australians entering retirement villages; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) further acknowledges that the Government will continue to work to improve housing outcomes for Australians by establishing the Housing Australia Future Fund, developing a new National Housing and Homelessness Plan and providing approximately $1.6 billion per year to the states and territories through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement.

        (1) acknowledges the vital role the Australian trucking industry plays in the transportation of goods along the supply chain;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that the trucking industry is an industry made up of, amongst others, almost 60,000 small and family-owned businesses, operating on tight margins;

         National Transport Commission
        </a>
        anticipates that by imposing a 10 per cent annual increase to the heavy vehicle road user charge the tax paid on fuel would increase from 27.2 cents per litre to 36.2 cents per litre by July 2025, equating an additional $1.35 billion per year by 2025-26;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) recognises that many heavy vehicle road users are unable to pass on the increased costs, which will impact viability of logistics business, leading to inevitable collapse over coming months;

       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to rule out increasing the heavy vehicle road user charge by 10 per cent in the interests of the heavy vehicle sector.

        (1) acknowledges the Government inherited an economy defined by a decade of stagnant wages, flatlining productivity, weak business investment, skills shortages and energy policy chaos; and

        (2) notes that in the first ten months, the Government has:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) successfully argued for a minimum wage increase and passed legislation to get wages moving again;

        (b) legislated cheaper child care and cheaper medicines;

        (e) handed down a budget that delivered responsible cost of living relief and invested in the drivers of economic growth without adding to inflation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes the next budget will build on these strong foundations with help for energy bills, higher wages for aged care workers and investments in economic growth.
