       <p>
        I stand today to commend the dedicated work of chaplains in public schools in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        . It is also very timely to acknowledge the presence of our parliamentary chaplain,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rose" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Rose
        </a>
        , in the chamber here today. He does a magnificent job of supporting our parliamentarians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently hosted a chaplains' breakfast in Albany with Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Ryan
        </a>
        , Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education. It was a great opportunity to discuss informally some of the issues and challenges faced by youth in this part of my electorate. The chaplains were united in their gratitude for the ongoing support offered to them by the federal government's commitment of $243 million over the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools in my electorate of O'Connor are currently eligible for up to $24,000 to fund a chaplain, depending on their remoteness.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Findlay" rel="nofollow">
         Brent Findlay
        </a>
        , area chaplain for YouthCare in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Southern" rel="nofollow">
         Great Southern
        </a>
        outlined a chaplain's role as providing nonbiased pastoral care both to students and to teachers, and supporting the school community as a whole. YouthCare chaplain, Phil Goodall, who travels widely to the more remote schools in the Great Southern relayed a heartfelt thank you to the Prime Minister, cabinet, Senator Ryan and me from a young Borden Primary School student for providing the funding to allow Phil to visit her school of 20 to assist her and her classmates.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the breakfast, chaplains recounted the common themes of social alienation, despite the technological interconnectivity of today, and the changing structure of our families and communities as possible reasons for youth disenchantment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A chaplain focuses on supporting the social and emotional wellbeing of students, encouraging positive self-image and their sense of place in their family and community. Supporting teachers and parents was also cited as an integral part of their daily job. Overall the aim is to facilitate positive social, emotional and academic outcomes, driven by the individuals themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Ryan and I later joined the students at the Alta-1 College middle school, a pilot program for 12-to-14-year-old students who, for whatever reason, are at risk of being marginalised in the mainstream schooling system. Students at Alta-1 are engaged in an alternative education, focused on personal growth, recovery and life readiness whilst on a modified curriculum centred around an individualised education plan. Low student to staff ratios facilitate this process. I thank Alta-1 team leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sharp" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Sharp
        </a>
        , middle school teacher Kylie Ditchburn, and Chaplains Joel Baty and Josh Hotchkins from Alta-1 for taking the time to introduce me to their students and discuss their innovative approach to education and support for some of our more challenged future citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my support for the National School Chaplaincy Program, and commend the chaplains of O'Connor for their dedicated and ongoing support of our rural and regional students.
