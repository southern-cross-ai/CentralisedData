       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to one of the nice guys in politics, the member for Fisher,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Such" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Such
        </a>
        , who recently passed away. Dr Such, who battled a brain tumour for six months, passed away aged 70. He left high school and 14 to do farm work but returned to school to study. Before entering parliament, he was a lecturer and researcher at what is now the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a local resident since birth and attended Coromandel Valley Primary School. I remember him being a regular attender at events in Coromandel Valley, including the community fair and the 175th anniversary celebrations, Coro Alive! Bob could always be found at The Hub Shopping Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfoyle_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —that is a new part of my electorate—and, whenever I was holding a listening post, Bob would pass by and see what was going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember him being elected on 25 November 1989. It was a state election which was very much dominated by high interest rates and people struggling with their mortgages, and Fisher was a classic outer-suburban mortgage-belt seat, and still is, with families, mortgages and people who are trying to get ahead. He served as Minister for Employment, Training and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_Education" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; Minister for Youth Affairs; Deputy Speaker;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_Committees" rel="nofollow">
         Chairman of Committees
        </a>
        ; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House of Assembly
        </a>
        . He introduced numerous bills, including antihoon bills and spent conviction laws. He always had many motions before the parliament, including law reform of traffic infringement, and men's health and women's health issues. He had some interesting niche issues as well. He proposed a scheme whereby people could have natural burial—something which is done in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and he was proposing that it be available in South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was a kind and thoughtful man who dedicated his life to public service. He had a strong passion for politics and he was a parliamentarian of great dignity and principle. South Australia has lost a great thinker, a motivator and, most of all, a great man. He represented his southern suburb seat for almost 25 years and locals held him in the highest regard. Whenever I went around Aberfoyle Park and

        </a>
        prior to the last election, I would often hear residents say, 'I've been to see Bob about this.' He was very much the first person who people would turn to. I would like to pass on my sincerest condolences to Dr Such's wife, Lyn, his family and friends.
