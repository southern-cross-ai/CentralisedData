        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister outline the growth in government spending over recent years? What efforts have been made to cut government spending in previous years, and what steps is the government taking to cut spending now? What is the government’s response to proposals for new spending?

        <p>
         Inflation is at the highest level that Australia has experienced in 16 years and it is being fuelled by government spending, which is running at a 4½ per cent increase in real terms in the current financial year. Treasury analysis published last week gave us some indication as to why this is the case. It showed that over the past four budgets the former Liberal government virtually had no savings initiatives at all. Only about five per cent of the total new initiatives in the budget over the past four years constituted savings. In other words, in the budgets for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, roughly 95 per cent was new spending and five per cent was savings. The Treasury document shows, when you get to the 2007 budget, that the savings bar on the graph is so tiny you can barely see it. That is one of the key reasons why we have an inflation problem in this country, and that is one of the problems that this government is committed to tackling.

         Unfortunately, not much has changed on the other side. They do not believe that this is a problem. They do not believe there is an inflation problem. The member for Wentworth has said it is all a fairytale. The Leader of the National Party thinks the solution to the problem is to increase spending. And they are still advocating further increases in government spending. Recently we got a very interesting proposal for a new piece of very substantial government spending from the member for Mayo, the last of the Bourbons, in an article in the

         headed ‘Build us a beacon’, in which he put forward his view about what the government should be spending its money on. He called on the government to build:

                      <p>
                       Mr Speaker, I have been critical of the Leader of the National Party for his attitude to government spending in recent times, but I would have to say this in his defence: at least his monument, the Fishing Hall of Fame, was only going to cost the taxpayer $3 million. The member for Mayo’s monument, the one that he is proposing, is $300 million. His answer and the Liberal Party’s answer to all of those Australians who are out there suffering higher prices in groceries, higher rents or higher mortgage payments and who are worried about inflation is, ‘Let them eat cake.’ That is the position that the Liberal Party and the member for Mayo put in this bizarre spending proposal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       That is not the position of the government. We accept there is a serious challenge here for the Australian government to get inflation back into the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                        Reserve Bank
                       </a>
                       target band. We accept that there is a serious challenge for this government to get government spending down to a reasonable level, not at a 4½ per cent real terms increase per annum. And most particularly, we accept that it is critical that government spending is directed to investments that will build the economic capacity of this nation for the long term, for our children—the infrastructure and skills that will generate high levels of productivity, economic growth and wellbeing for future Australians.
