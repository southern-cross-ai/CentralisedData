       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to a number of local residents in my community who received Queen’s Birthday honours. I would like to acknowledge Barry Walsh
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , John King OAM and Ronald Richter OAM. Joan Reese was made a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        posthumously. I would also like to acknowledge Keith Rhind OAM and Reverend Peter Kilkeary OAM, who were residents of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        but have also been an important part of the Lindsay electorate for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        To become a Member of the Order of Australia, or to be conferred with any of the nation’s highest honours, is a demonstration of a person’s contribution to his or her profession or cause, and their community. These people come from all walks of life; they are our stars, our quiet achievers. All of these individuals have shown their dedication and their strength of character and I congratulate each one of them for their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barry Walsh OAM is known to many people as the face of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Panthers
        </a>
        . Barry is the current chair of the Panthers board of directors and has been in that role for the last 10 years. He has overseen some major changes to the Panthers group and has seen the odd premiership win. He is also the chairman of the Panthers on the Prowl Community Development Foundation, something I know he is passionate about. I look forward to working closely with him on that in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keith Rhind OAM is another Penrith Panthers luminary. He played for Penrith from 1963 to 1966, and moved to managing the club for more than two decades as a member of its board, including being chair and deputy chair. Keith has been instrumental in mentoring junior players and is a life member of the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        John King OAM is a fire and emergency services volunteer who has served his community for more than 40 years. He has been a member of the Regentville Bushfire Brigade and a member of the Rural Fire Service Protocol team. He has also volunteered at the Sydney Paralympic Games and at the Australian Wheelchair Tennis Open. He currently volunteers as a bus driver for Penrith Council and the Penrith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        Ladies Auxiliary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ronald Richter OAM was recognised for his contribution to athletics. Thirty years ago Ronald started taking his children to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">
         Little Athletics
        </a>
        and has been volunteering ever since, including volunteering at the Olympics and for Athletes with a disAbility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joan Reese OAM passed away in February this year. She was a dedicated history research volunteer for more than two decades and was also a recipient of the New South Wales Premiers Senior Achievement Award in 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reverend Peter Kilkeary OAM has worked in churches all over Sydney including the Penrith Baptist Church. Although he now lives in Winmalee, he still ministers to people in my local community including the sick and injured at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to each of the Queen’s Birthday honours recipients in my community. I thank them on behalf of the people in my community for their tireless work. They are indeed our shining lights.
