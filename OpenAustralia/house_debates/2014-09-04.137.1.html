       <p>
        I was delighted yesterday when I learned that two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        women, Simone Jolliffe and Genevieve Smith , had won scholarships through the federal government's Board Diversity Scholarship programâ€”very well deserved awards indeed. More than 300 rural and regional women applied for the scholarships, following applicants' successful completion of a company directors professional development course. I was really pleased that two locals were successful. It shows the impressive diversity, the capability and the leadership skills of women right throughout the Riverina.
       </p>
       <p>
        Simone Jolliffe helps run a dairy and irrigation farm at Euberta. Indeed, in February this year she was appointed to the Australian Dairy Farmers Board. The ADF President,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Noel Campbell
        </a>
        , said Mrs Jolliffe owns and runs a 220-cow dairy farm in Wagga Wagga with her husband Neil . She is a busy lady. She has three young children. She helps milk the cows. She is showing rural leadership. She is very deserving of this award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Genevieve Smith was recognised for her important work with the Wagga Women's Health Centre. She is an expert in information technology and, when she is not running after her two kids, she is organised enough to help out with

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Medical_Research_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Medical Research Institute
        </a>
        , which runs a very successful Christmas fair to raise funds for valuable medical research. As I say, they are both very deserving recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the government's announcement of $650,000 over two years to empower more rural women to obtain positions on boards. Yesterday's announcement was made by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Michaelia Cash. It will see a record 140 scholarships awarded for a broader range of professional development than ever in the past. These important grants aim to see more female leaders in every industry, every business, every city and every region in Australia. It is great news for the Riverina region. It is great news for the recipients Simone and Genevieve, and I know they will bring a broad range of skills back to the region, as well as enhancing their own professional development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Michaelia Cash is to be congratulated on promoting this particular initiative. The coalition has some very, very powerful and really forward-thinking women in the upper house, not least of whom are my Nationals colleagues

        , who is doing some great things in the field of education. I do congratulate both Genevieve and Simone on these wonderful awards. I also congratulate Senator Michaelia Cash for promoting these awards. And I congratulate all rural women recipients of these and good luck to them for the future.
