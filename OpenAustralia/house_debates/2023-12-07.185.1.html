         The Christmas
        </a>
        season is often associated with gifts but, as the Christmas presents are wrapped and unwrapped amidst the hustle and bustle of carols and finding a car park at overcrowded shopping centres, may we remember the greatest gift of all, given to us and told through that simple, age-old story: the telling of the very first Christmas. The story of the birth of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
         Jesus Christ
        </a>
        is a story so familiar we almost know it by heart: the story of a baby born in a manger; the story of angels in a field that heralded the proclamation of peace on earth and goodwill to all; the story of a king who came to serve, save and grant love to all of mankind. It's a story that didn't just unfold 2,000 years ago but rings so poignantly true for our world today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to all the local Christian organisations in my electorate for donating thousands of hampers to those in need over this holiday period, and for organising Christmas carol services throughout the area as well. This generosity at Christmas, from Christian churches and other community groups, will make a big impact after a tough year, financially, for many people. It's important to note that many of them do this because they love other people, and that will have a massive impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the MPs who work in this House, I want to thank you for your tireless work to serve your own communities throughout Australia. To my coalition colleagues, I'm also grateful for your support.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my staff, thank you for all the work that you do. Without you, none of what we are able to do for the people of Petrie would be possible. You keep the show going in Petrie when I'm down here, 17 weeks a year, representing the people in the electorate. I also want to especially mention my office manager, Salome Nel, who is going on maternity leave tomorrow to have her third daughter. The entire team, Salome, are so thrilled for you, and we cannot wait to meet your new daughter.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all the volunteers in the Petrie electorate, thank you for the impact that you've had throughout 2023, serving people in the area. Volunteering is so important and, on behalf of the people of Petrie, I want to thank you for volunteering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, to my family—to my wife, Louise, and my three sons William, Thomas and Samuel—I love you and I'm proud of everything that you have achieved this year, particularly with my eldest son finishing university and the other two doing well, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we come to the final days of 2023, I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Petrie for your support. This year I celebrated 10 years as your federal MP, and I hope I'm a little bit wiser than when I was first elected in delivering for you and the needs that we have in our community. To be your representative—to serve, to deliver and to partner with you—is, of course, a great privilege. I know this year has been tough, financially, for many people, but I truly wish you the best and I hope that this holiday period is filled with love, happiness and faith. As we celebrate the birth of our saviour this Christmas, may his peace and love surround you, regardless of whether you are from the Christian faith or no faith at all. I trust that all of us have a blessed 2024.
