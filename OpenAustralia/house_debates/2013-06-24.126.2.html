        The spirit of sport club person of the year was awarded to Group 6 referee Kim-Maree Teale. She certainly has a story to tell.

She is a mentor to four female referees and has been on the committee as secretary, assistant secretary, vice-president and president. Kim is the first female president of the referees association. To achieve recognition as president in a male-dominated sport shows the great respect, leadership and knowledge Kim brings to Group 6 Football. Kim has introduced a charity for the young referees to participate in called Save our Sons, committed to finding a cure for

He scored 650 runs this season. He was selected in the New South Wales under-19 team as a top-order batsman with his highest score of 122.

He has now been identified as an elite cricketer in Australia and I am very excited to follow his progress over the next few years as he continues to achieve great things.

        Finally, I would like to thank the Western Suburbs Leagues Club and the Wests Sports Council for supporting our local athletes and sporting clubs. I congratulate all of this year's award winners for their hard work and great achievements on the sports field. The Macarthur community is certainly very, very proud of you all.
