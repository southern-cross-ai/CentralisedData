       <p>
        Today I wish to share with the chamber my experiences and insights from recent visits to the vibrant religious temples in my electorate of Gorton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I had the privilege of visiting the Sri Durga Temple located in Deanside in the western part of my electorate. Sri Durga is one of the largest Hindu temples, if not the largest, in Melbourne and certainly one of the largest in Australia. During a typical week, and particularly on weekends, literally thousands flock to this sacred space. Notably, nearly 75 per cent of these attendees reside in Melbourne's western suburbs, highlighting the significant role this temple plays in the lives of many of my constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my visit, I was met by Sri Durga Temple president, Kulwant Joshi, and other dedicated committee members. Their passion for community service and charitable initiatives was truly inspiring. I learnt about their efforts in providing food to those in need, underscoring the vital role religious institutions play in addressing social issues and fostering a sense of community responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the third temple I'd visited recently. Earlier this year, I went to Murugan Temple. It had recently received federal funding through the government's Stronger Communities Program for a well-needed upgrade to their kitchen facilities. Upon arrival, I was warmly received by the temple's president, Subramanium Dharmakularajah, and other committee members. The Murugan Temple stands not only as a place of worship for the temple community, but as a symbol of cultural preservation and identity. The commitment to maintaining traditions and values were evident during my visit, reinforcing the importance of religious institutions in preserving our diverse heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the same day I had the privilege of visiting the Paramitha Buddhist Temple, where I was graciously shown around by its president, Peter Perera, and the committee. Paramitha recently received a federal grant to assist in the building of a secure gate and fence for their car park. It's another step towards their goal of creating a serene oasis for those seeking spiritual practice and mindfulness. The peaceful atmosphere and the commitment to Buddhist teachings were on display. These temples are not just places of worship, however; they are community hubs that extend their impact far beyond religious practice. They serve as catalysts for charitable works, social cohesion and cultural preservation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As representatives of diverse and dynamic communities, it is our responsibility to recognise and appreciate the valuable contributions religious institutions make. They play an integral role in fostering unity, compassion and social responsibility, and I urge my colleagues to continue supporting initiatives that ensure the flourishing of cultural and religious diversity in Gorton, recognising that it is a source of strength that binds us together. Let us all commit to supporting the endeavours of these religious and cultural organisations that contribute so significantly to the wellbeing of our constituents throughout the country.
