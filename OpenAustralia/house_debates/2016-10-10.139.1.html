        . While we welcome them, I would like to take some time this morning to recognise the immeasurable contribution of ward 5 stalwart Charlie Lowles, who announced his retirement before the election. Charlie, 84, has lived in Blackett since 1970 and served on Blacktown council from 1989. A military veteran, Charlie brought huge energy and dedication to the local community. He is probably one of the great volunteers of Blacktown and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Druitt" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Druitt
        </a>
        . His public service will be remembered for generations and is a huge legacy to live up to. His council contribution was a bookend to years of work nurturing connections between sporting and charity organisations well before he even stood for elected office—for example, being integral to the Lethbridge Park Rangers soccer club for decades and serving as president of the Popondetta Park committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, through more than 27 years of council service, Charlie helped to shape and mould the future of Blacktown city. We are all grateful for his generosity and the work that he showed and delivered at all times through his pursuit of social justice, fairness, educational opportunities and multicultural cohesion. He was a strong advocate for many community projects, including the Mount Druitt library and community hub, Mount Druitt swimming pools, the volleyball and basketball courts and Emerton youth centre. He would always speak up if people were not getting a fair go, regardless of the political party involved. As much as he spearheaded the push to see a debt-free council, he championed social investment for education, training, community health—things that the booming Blacktown region would be poised to benefit from for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        While representing an area full of young families, Charlie actively promoted recreational spaces and participation in organised activities. He defended the retention of the city name Blacktown, saying it is the city’s heritage and history acknowledging the people who walked the land before he did. He challenged perceptions about the suburbs he loved through simple acts—for example, 'Why shouldn't we beautify things like roundabouts,' he would ask? 'Because they get vandalised,' he was told. 'No, community pride will protect them better than any council ranger can'—and he was right. He was always pushing for quality to reflect the quality of the people we are proud to represent. In 2013, he was awarded an Order of Australia for his service to local government. It was a rightful recognition of his contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Charlie Lowles is one of the unsung heroes of the Labor Party in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I will always be indebted for the care and guidance he extended to me as a new member of parliament. I do not think there will ever be another Charlie Lowles in our area, but we can aspire to serve as well as he did. His lasting contribution is a monument to his stamina, decency and good will. On behalf of our entire community, we thank Charlie Lowles.
