        [by video link] As the whole country looks to the future as we emerge from the pandemic, two recent projects in northern Tasmania are helping to cement the economic and creative future of the region. Recently I was thrilled to officially open the first 15 kilometres of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        mountain bike trails at Mount George. As the candidate for the seat of Bass in the 2019 election, I fought to secure the $4.4 million in funding needed. Design and construction of the Mount George trails, with 80 kilometres to build overall, has been undertaken by internationally renowned trail builders World Trail. From the feedback I've received from locals and other mountain bike enthusiasts from across Tasmania, the first 15 kilometres is certainly ticking all the right boxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though our government has provided funding, these trails are collaboration between the government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Bell Bay Aluminium. Bell Bay Aluminium, the largest employer in the municipality, continues to invest in the future of our community. I would like to thank them and, in particular, General Manager Shona Markham, for facilitating access to the land owned by the smelter for a significant portion of the trails. The trail is just 35 minutes from Launceston and, with the world-class Derby mountain bike trails in northern Tasmania, is another fantastic addition to the region's growing reputation as a premier destination for mountain biking enthusiasts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        region, after years of work and due diligence behind the scenes, the state's first-ever fermentation hub is one big step closer to getting off the ground, after securing $7Â½ million through the most recent round of Building Better Regions Fund. A winner for agriculture and tourism, the hub will allow budding fermentation businesses to utilise the hub's equipment and research facilities, lowering development costs and fostering new products. The 1,899-square-metre purpose-built fermentation facility will be a hub of innovation, education and tourism across a wide range of fermented food and drink industries, including kimchi, kefir and kombucha and more traditional fermented industries, such as baking and cheesemaking.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hub is a job generator for our region, with around 650 jobs expected to be created between now and 2030. It will also offer training and educational opportunities in fermentation skills and hands-on experiences for tourists. I have been a big supporter of the project for many years and would like to thank FermenTasmania chairperson Kim Seagram and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        Karina Dambergs for their tireless work on the project and for not giving up on an idea that has been seven years in the making. I would also like to thank the

        </a>
        for providing the land.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania is a world leader in the production of fermented food and beverages, and I'm incredibly excited that our government has been able to support a project that will be a game changer for northern Tasmania.
