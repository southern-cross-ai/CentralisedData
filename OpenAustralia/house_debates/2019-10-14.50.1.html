       <p>
        Australia is the only English-speaking country in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">

        that does not have audio description on free-to-air television. This service is vital for Australians with blindness or low vision to fully enjoy television and not be left guessing what is happening during breaks in dialogue. This issue was raised with me by my constituent John Shawcross of Gwandalan and his granddaughter Layla Stennett. Layla wrote to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having access to audio would mean that my Pop does not miss out on visual aspects of television and perhaps more importantly he has equal access to news and information. Music, sci-fi films and the arts have always been a big part of my Pop's life and it is very important to me that he is able to continue to experience the things that give him joy.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's important to me as well, and it is important to Labor. But this third-term Liberal government has been dragging its feet on introducing audio description in Australia for six years. Throughout that time, Labor has kept focus and attention on the issue and has been advocating in parliament, in the media and in the broader community on behalf of the vision impaired. It is galling that our popular television programs, such as
        <i>
         Neighbours
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Home and Away
        </i>
        , are sent to audiences overseas with audio description, but that service is not available in Australia. Australians who are living with blindness and low vision, like my constituent John Shawcross, deserve equal enjoyment of free-to-air television. They deserve audio description, and this government must deliver.
