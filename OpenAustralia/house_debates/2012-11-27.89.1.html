        This government supports constitutional change to recognise the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and we are committed to achieving this. We appointed an expert panel to develop options for constitutional change to help us work out how best to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. Now, for the first time, we have specific proposals on how to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, and I thank the expert panel members for their excellent work in developing these proposals. We are now working, through Reconciliation Australia and You Me Unity, to build a movement for change of our Constitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        In extending the time frame for a referendum, we have also set out a clear way forward and momentum to build support. This week, we will be introducing a bill for an act of recognition, acknowledging the unique and special place of our first peoples. The act will demonstrate that parliament is united on progressing constitutional recognition to show the Australian community the leadership needed for change. I am pleased that the opposition, the Greens and a number of Independents have shown their support to pass the act of recognition. Strong parliamentary support for the bill will help build momentum for change. We have proposed a sunset date of two years, setting a clear time frame to work towards the ultimate goal of constitutional recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        To further show the parliament's desire to work together towards the goal of successful referendum, we agreed to work with the opposition to establish a joint select committee. The membership of the committee will be drawn from across the parliament. The committee will be asked to consider the bill for the act of recognition as its first task, reporting in late January next year. The committee will be then asked to continue to progress constitutional change. The recommendations of the expert panel will be the foundation of their considerations. I thank all the incoming members of the committee for their willingness to take on this very important task. We know that there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that we are able to hold a successful referendum that unites our nation. The committee will play a significant role in ensuring that this occurs. I commend the motion to the House.

         Achieving constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         s is a very significant step towards genuine and lasting reconciliation. It is a cause the coalition has long been associated with and one that we have proudly long supported. The coalition's position for over a decade has been that there should be recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in the Constitution. That is why when we were in government, in 1999, we put a proposal to the people seeking to include recognition in the preamble of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Constitution
         </a>
         . As history records, our proposal unfortunately did not succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
         We again strongly advocated for such recognition during the 2007 election campaign. It would come as no surprise, therefore, that it was our proactive approach to this issue that ensured it retained the attention it so deserves. It was the Leader of the Opposition who wrote to the Prime Minister proposing that such a committee, as proposed by the motion moved by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, be established. We must all remain mindful that the primary objective of a constitutional referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to achieve a unifying moment for our nation, a moment similar to that of the 1967 referendum. The work done by the expert panel, including my friend and colleague the member for Hasluck, the first Indigenous person to be elected to this House, has continued the journey of reconciliation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reconciliation is something that we believe in. It is something which we are proud to support. And it is something which we will continue to advocate. We remain of the view that constitutional recognition is a continuation of that important journey.
