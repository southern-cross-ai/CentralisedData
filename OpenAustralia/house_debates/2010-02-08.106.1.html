       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 26 November 2009 about a petition submitted regarding the relocation of the Moe Library and Latrobe Council Services Centre.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Funding of $2 million towards the Moe Community Hub building was announced as an election commitment by the Australian Government on 24 October 2007. The project is currently being considered by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (the Department) for funding under the Better Regions Program.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Better Regions Program will provide $176 million over four years to assist regional Australia with much-needed community facilities and services, identified by local communities as priorities for their regions.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The proposed Community Hub building will form part of the Latrobe City Council's proposed Moe Rail Precinct redevelopment, which is currently undergoing detailed design. The Community Hub building will provide a new library, mother and child health centre, meeting rooms, interne cafe and gallery area. These services were identified as desirable in the precinct during extensive periods of community consultation by the Latrobe City Council.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I understand that the petition received by the Committee represents residents who object to the relocation of the library from its present site to the proposed Community Hub building. I will consider this issue in the context of advice from my Department on the proposal for funding under the Better Regions Program. However, the appropriate channel to express concerns is to the Latrobe City Council which is the proponent for the development.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for raising this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the
       <b>
        Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese
