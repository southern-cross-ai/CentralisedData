           will sit down. I will just deal with an interjection. Nobody jumped when ‘Prospect jumped’, as you put it, Leader of the National Party. In the past, an alert side of the House may have had somebody jump. I am not offering advice and consultancy to the opposition but I just make that observation.

            Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I clearly saw the member for Wentworth jump to his feet as you were looking over there. It has been the practice of Speakers of this House to grant some leniency—

               I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She has significant primary industries within her electorate and is also, I understand, an ambassador for Beef Week in Queensland. I would like to kick off by referring to some malicious rumours that have been put out by the National Party, which claim that I do not have a background in primary industries. I would like to put on the record that they are absolutely true—I do not. That is why I have decided that it is essential not only to be taking advice from my own department and from the official stakeholder groups but also to be spending every moment that I can actually meeting with people who work the land, on their land. To that end, I am pleased to report to the House that since receiving the portfolio in December, I have met with primary producers in Roma and Kyogle—with the Prime Minister—and in Emerald, Tamworth, Inverell,

                Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the honourable member wants to give us a guided tour of Australia, surely he can do it in a ministerial statement. This is an answer to a question, and previous Speakers have made a point of bringing the member’s attention back to the question that has been asked, rather than allowing him to go on with gasbagging.

                  In the course of those visits I have had the opportunity, with regard to the different election promises which we have undertaken, to gain a view of the different views of people working the land—for instance, on the reforms which we have undertaken and are now implementing with respect to wheat marketing arrangements for the $3.5 billion wheat industry in Australia. Both Kelly Shields and Mark Hyde, and the pastoralists and graziers when I visited them in

                  We have also extended assistance in the wake of equine influenza. That assistance was due to end on 8 February but has now been extended to 14 March. Particularly given the comments today from the

                  Minister for Primary Industries, we are very hopeful that there will no longer be red and purple zones by 14 March. I have had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the peak bodies of the Australian horse industry from Queensland and New South Wales and also those involved in the racing industry at
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Farm" rel="nofollow">
                   Warwick Farm

                  . It is no exaggeration to say that in the wake of

                  the horse industry has been devastated in recent months, and I am sure that we will have more to say on that when the Callinan inquiry reports.

                  The damage caused by the floods in New South Wales and Queensland has been particularly shocking. When I visited Emerald with the Minister for Human Services and Kyogle with the Prime Minister, we had the opportunity to meet with affected families. It was made clear to us that the full extent of damage by floods is not always clear at the high-water mark. We were able to lend a helping hand under the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and hear about the good work being done on the ground by the members for Flynn and Page to help working families affected.

                  The savings measures on drought have been referred to and were announced by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The two concepts of drought and climate change, while different, are intrinsically linked. The member for New England, as well as presenting me with an Akubra, for which I thank him, took me out to Brian and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Reid" rel="nofollow">
                   Marion Reid
                  </a>
                  ’s sheep and cattle farm at Bendemeer, near Tamworth. Compounding the problem of drought that those families were able to tell us about is, of course, the serious inflation problem. It is not simply people in suburbia who are affected by mortgages and who are concerned about Australia having the highest inflation rate in 16 years. To that end, we identified where savings could be made within the drought assistance programs that would not affect farmers who are receiving much-needed help.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Unfortunately, in the wake of those savings, which were done in a way that would not affect farmers who were receiving much-needed help, a fear campaign was waged by the Leader of the National Party which, if successful, will only have the impact of causing farmers who are entitled to assistance not to apply. It is the first time there has been a departure from bipartisan support on drought assistance.

                   Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am reluctant to do this on his maiden ministerial question, but I draw the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry back to the question he was asked. It was about beef and a range of other issues. He is totally out of order in relation to his own question. It should be a ministerial statement.
