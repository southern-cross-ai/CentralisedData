        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today Labor announced our support for 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave to be put into the National Employment Standards. Will the Prime Minister join with Labor and support this very important reform?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. I was pleased to be with him this morning at the launch of White Ribbon Day, where we both made the commitment, yet again, to bring an end to violence against women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all disrespect of women leads to violence against women, but that is where all violence against women begins. Respect for women must be at the very heart of what it means to be an Australian, and that's why we are taking strong action right now to stop family and domestic violence at the start. Last week, we launched the National Domestic Violence Order Scheme, which ensures that those who breach domestic violence orders from the court will be in breach of the law. We're amending the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         to stop perpetrators directly cross-examining a victim in family violence matters. We're introducing the Family Law Amendment (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Violence" rel="nofollow">
          Family Violence
         </a>
         and Other Measures) Bill this week to criminalise, as I noted, the breach of personal protection orders issued under the Family Law Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Turning to paid family and domestic violence leave, the Fair Work Commission recently rejected the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
          ACTU
         </a>
         's claim to introduce 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave into all modern awards, but it is still considering the role of unpaid family and domestic violence leave. We respect, as honourable members know, the independence of the commission. We await that decision and we'll consider it very carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, regardless of what the commission decides, Australian men must think about what they can do to advance equality and call out violence whenever they see it. In our roles as fathers, sons, brothers, colleagues, mates and leaders, all of us are capable of saying that that behaviour and that language is not okay when we see someone showing disrespect.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to remind the honourable member, the Leader of the Opposition, that he recently made a very deliberate decision to visit the

             That objection, that point of order from the member from Watson shows how he fundamentally misunderstands the cause of domestic violence. It is disrespect for women. You have got members of the

              CFMEU
             </a>
             threatening domestic violence, and does he condemn it? Oh, no. His leader goes to show his solidarity. Let me say this to you: it's about time the Leader of the Opposition stood up for something. He could stand up for respect for women. He could stand up for Australia. He could stand up for the security of our country.
