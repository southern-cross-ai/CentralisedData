        There is a downturn in Australian coal, mainly due to global prices being down, which was brought on by an oversupply of the market, but it has not been aided in the last few years by high input costs such as Labor's carbon tax and the sovereign risk created in the form of Labor's mining tax. On the ground level in the Mackay region, we have witnessed the result—thousands of job losses and local businesses closing their doors or drastically downsizing—but it is not all doom and gloom. The Galilee Basin is set to power ahead thanks to investment by Indian energy company Adani and a recent commitment by the Queensland
