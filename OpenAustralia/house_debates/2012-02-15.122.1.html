       <p>
        Dunkley residents can be assured that I will continue to work for a supportive economic and policy environment that addresses the concerns of local manufacturers, particularly component manufacturers to the automotive industry. Recently I was pleased to visit a Seaford component manufacturer and talk with them about their experiences given the downturn in the number of locally produced cars, the high Australian dollar and the scary scheduled start of the carbon tax that they are having to contend with.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Guest" rel="nofollow">

        and Co. stressed the importance of well-targeted government funding and how the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax will affect the viability of their business and the 60 people they employ.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the major car manufacturers are struggling, it puts pressure right down the supply chain, with component manufacturers like Colin Guest and Co. at the pointy end. We need to help these types of businesses not only because of the people they employ but because of the knowledge, capacity and skills that they contribute to the economy. The team at Colin Guest and Co. design and produce world-class drive-shaft support components for rear-wheel-drive vehicles that outperform competitors on performance, noise levels and durability. This is why some 60 per cent of their production is exported to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Ford and Chrysler, particularly in the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clear and consistent policy that the coalition implemented during the Howard government years provided an excellent platform for the car industry to pursue success, with higher production levels servicing healthy domestic and international demand, underpinned by over $4.2 billion worth of funding for the industry in the 10-year period through to 2015. The Howard government's investment levels and settled policies were based on a strategic long-term vision and supported a sustainable, efficient and innovative industry producing higher volumes of models that met local and export demand. Toyota's local production at that time was nearly three times what it is today, and we need to return to that formula of targeted, thoughtful investment, predictability and support for world-class performance within the industry. It has worked well in the past; it will work well into the future. Those stable policies provided the car industry with the certainty that it was looking for in challenging times.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gillard Labor government's carbon tax and $1.4 billion of broken promises have left car bosses scratching their heads and wondering why Australia is putting up barriers to production and why big announcements upon which forward plans are made are subsequently withdrawn without consultation. The chopping and changing and policy surprises by the Gillard Labor government have unsettled decision makers in Detroit and Tokyo, and this makes a difficult economic environment even more challenging.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the topic of local small business, I am concerned to learn that a world-class videoconferencing service provider in my electorate is being overlooked by the Gillard Labor government in favour of high-cost travel and overseas owned providers, according to the information that has been made available to me. It is disappointing that this world-class business, Express Virtual Meetings, located in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Eliza
        </a>
        in my electorate, is earning and servicing contracts right across the economy but the Commonwealth is overlooking this quality local business in favour of companies that are listed on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        stock exchange.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am led to believe that nearly 50 per cent of all the Commonwealth teleconferencing services commissioned over the past two years have been given to businesses not approved under the Australian Government Telecommunications Arrangements. Of these businesses given Commonwealth contracts not approved under the AGTA, 100 per cent were owned by overseas countries. It is about time the Gillard government was serious about supporting local businesses when they are recognised as world-class and not simply sending that work overseas without going through due process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in the time that is available I want to acknowledge the Dunkley Student Recognition and Encouragement Award recipients for the last calendar year. Luke Pagram, Brianna Dillon, Isaac Pavlou, Elana McCormick, Chloe Baker, Britney Wilde, Pieter LeRoux, Brendon Thompson, Bree Tolley, Joel Nicholls, Harley Muscat, Rachelle Flight, Kosta Giannakopoulos, Jan Silayan, Madison Scully, Leith Bell, Taylah Roach, Josh Gardener and Lauryn Coyle were all recipients of the Dunkley Student Recognition and Encouragement Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        These awards acknowledge the students' really valuable personal qualities of being positive in their interactions with their peers and staff and their attitude to everyday school life and the challenges that they address. The awards acknowledge that they are passionate about improvements in personal achievement, in assisting others to achieve their best and in their belief in and commitment to their school and their personal goals. The awards also acknowledge that they are persistent. It is about always being willing to have a go and not giving up easily. 'Positive, passionate and persistent', colleagues would know, is my campaign slogan and the approach that I take to my work. It is important to recognise these personal qualities that support achievement for people, regardless of their background. Your postcode does not determine your potential; it is these personal qualities, and they deserve recognition.
