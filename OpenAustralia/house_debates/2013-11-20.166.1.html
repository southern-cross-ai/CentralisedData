        Thank you, Madam Deputy Chair, and I congratulate you on your ascension to the chair. I am absolutely delighted to speak today on behalf of all of those who were involved in the opening of the Divercity Multicultural Community Centre in Newmarket. I want particularly to congratulate Jeannie Mok, Pastor Jonathon and Pastor David Mok and all of the board who have put many hours of hard work and dedication into the opening of this centre. I was there along with my state colleague Robert Cavallucci and Councillor Vicki Howard. I was there to celebrate the opening, but it was a day of mixed emotions for me, because it was the original site of the Italian-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Club
        </a>
        , where I spent many, many years attending Italian Independence Day functions and weddings. Unfortunately, the club could no longer continue financially. Several years ago I and many other members became shareholders, but it was put into liquidation and that was a very sad day for the Italian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am absolutely delighted that Jeannie Mok and her team are now the custodians. It will be the home of the Multicultural Community Centre as well as the Asian-

        </a>
        and the International City Church. I want to pay tribute to Jeannie, because she has been working on behalf of the multicultural community of Queensland for over 20 years, and her contribution and dedication saw her awarded an honour in this year's Australian honours. There have been many wonderful people who have graced the centre over the years, and they have helped countless Australians with a number of critical issues, including learning new skills, finding work and overcoming the trauma of war and oppression.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend all of those who have dedicated their time to helping people find their feet in a new land. As a daughter of migrant parents I know only too well that it can be very daunting to come to a new country and experience a language barrier, cultural barriers and discrimination. I have an incredible appreciation for the work Jeannie is doing at the centre. The building is magnificent; it is breathtaking. There is a huge auditorium that many community groups throughout the northern regions of Brisbane will be able to use. There are lecture rooms and a restaurant on site. I know that Jeannie will be a very valued contributor to the northern multicultural community and that many people in the areas in the north of Brisbane will support her in her endeavours. I want to wish her and her team all the very best. Her motto, 'Changing lives and changing destinies', could not be more apt.
