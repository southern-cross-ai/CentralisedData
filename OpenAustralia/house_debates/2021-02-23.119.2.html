        Each of the wonderful recipients for the Griffith Australia Day Awards this year has made an enduring contribution to our community as a volunteer, seeking neither financial reward nor recognition. I'd like to acknowledge these award recipients and their contributions to our community. Candi Kelly, Julie and Barny Barnhill, Andrew Grace,

        have all held various volunteer roles within Community Friends. That's a wonderful organisation which collects and delivers food to our most vulnerable community members.

        The dedicated Easts Tigers Committee has tirelessly run a junior rugby league club every year, especially in 2020, when they navigated the global pandemic and kept the juniors playing. I'd like to thank the committee for being nominated.

        and Tracey Olivieri from the Friends of South Brisbane Cemetery have an extensive record. For over 15 years they have worked to improve and promote the cemetery, including organising 23 community cleaning bees and over 100 other events. The Friends of South Brisbane Cemetery is now the largest cemetery related community organisation in Australia, and Chris and Tracey dedicate over 40 hours of their own time each week to the cemetery.

        Luanne Carter has made a tremendous contribution to the Royals Netball Club, managing registrations, encouraging participation and making everyone feel welcome and supported, all with a smile on her face. Nicole Carey has dedicated her time to the Camp Hill P&amp;C Association through various roles over the years. Nicole spends an enormous amount of time supporting the school. Her calm, happy and inclusive demeanour is why she is often described as a superwoman.

He has held roles such as the secretary and president. Jeff has been integral to the success of the club and has coordinated events, fundraisers and a food drive for those experiencing hardship during the pandemic. He has even procured and arranged installation of an at-home chairlift for an elderly gentleman.

        Stephanie Ford is the well-known president of the Norman Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, which cares for our southside environment daily. In addition to her role on the committee, she runs a community nursery and a Bushcare group and provides support and encouragement to other Bushcare groups in the area. Angela Christodoulou has put in countless hours rescuing koalas—personally rescuing them—in South-East Queensland. She also spends her time educating others on the risks that koalas are facing and about how they can help.

        Bailey Newbold from Meals on Wheels Holland Park &amp; District gives back to the community. He was in the youth category of the awards. He gives back to the community by volunteering in the kitchen and sharing the skills he has learned as an apprentice chef. He has a contagious enthusiasm and a can-do attitude.

        Cate Vickers is an outstanding community contributor through her work for the Bulimba Community Centre. Cate and her committee have repositioned the centre, turning it from a senior citizens centre to a community hub, preparing the centre for its future while honouring its history. Ali Kadri is an outstanding advocate for the Muslim community and antidiscrimination, including at the Holland Park Mosque which serves part of my electorate. Ali has been the Queensland coordinator of Charity Australia for almost a decade and is a member of various advisory councils which work to build community understanding and cohesion. Of course, his impact extends well beyond the part of the mosque's patch which falls within my electorate.
