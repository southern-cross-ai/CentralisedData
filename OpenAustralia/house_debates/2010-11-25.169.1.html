       <p>
        I rise today to alert the parliament to a serious disease threat to one of the most important agricultural industries in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_Irrigation_Area" rel="nofollow">
         Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
        </a>
        , in my electorate of Riverina. The citrus industry based around Griffith, Leeton and Hillston comprises 8,500 hectares. It is the largest citrus-growing region in Australia. It produces about 200,000 tonnes of fresh oranges and juice every year. It exports about a third of its crop, which has a retail value of around $500 million. The Riverina citrus industry has watched with growing alarm the devastation caused by Huanglongbing,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLB" rel="nofollow">
         HLB
        </a>
        or greening disease, to the major citrus-growing regions of the world, including Brazil and Florida. Earlier this year Riverina Citrus sent three of its committee members to examine firsthand the damage that greening has caused in the United States of America.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Brazil four million trees have been removed and the Florida industry reports HLB is costing $300 million annually. And now the insect which spreads greening is spreading in California, where they are anticipating that if the disease follows it will reduce that stateâ€™s production by 20 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no cure for greening disease. It is an insidious disease which is only remedied by total removal of the orchard. Unfortunately, there is very little a farmer can do for preventative management apart from prompt removal of infected trees and multiple insect sprays. The disease is well and truly established by the time symptoms manifest themselves. Once it gains a foothold in a country it remorselessly spreads until it has contaminated every productive farming region. The citrus industry rightly fears the entry of the insect which could carry the disease into Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vector is an insect known as a psyllid and the major risk is entry of infected psyllids on cyclonic winds, live plants, nursery stock, budwood, fruit and possibly ornamental vegetation. The vector has been identified in countries to the north of Australia, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , Indonesia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        and Samoa. If there is an incursion the disease will destroy the Australian citrus industry, cost governments hundreds of millions of dollars and increase our dependence on imported fruit. This will lead only to increased prices on supermarket shelves and Australians will be left knowing little or nothing about the growing and environmental conditions under which imported food is grown. None of us wants that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Citrus growers in the Riverina are already desperately worried about the proposed water cutbacks in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIA" rel="nofollow">
         MIA
        </a>
        of the order of up to 43 per cent under the controversial guide to the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan. There is so much uncertainty in the regional farming communities of the MIA as a result of this unfair and un-Australian dagger to what the Griffith Mayor, Councillor Mike Neville, often describes as the heart and lungs of the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Certainly the MIA is the food bowl of Australia. It needs to be encouraged, promoted and supported in every way possible and by every level of government now and into the future. Sustaining this life-giving region with productive water and keeping it safe from any potential threats must always be a major priority. Plant Biosecurity has conducted a risk analysis in the form of a literature review to assess the quarantine risks posed by greening disease and its vectors. It did not identify where there may be any deficiencies in the existing import system or how surveillance could be improved. There was little or no consultation with industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The citrus industry has advised Biosecurity of the flaws in the review. Citrus farmers in my electorate are asking the government and the relevant agencies, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Quarantine_and_Inspection_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service
        </a>
        , to look again at this terrible agricultural disease with a more constructive attitude and with a greater sense of urgency. Greening disease is currently classified category 2. However, the disease is carried by a vector which is classified only as category 3. This is a recipe for inaction and lost opportunity. A small investment now and a change of category could save Australia millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs in the future. Our country must maintain its reputation for clean, green and safe agricultural produce.
