       </p>
       <p>
        I'll start off by saying that we stand on the brink of a new era, where the future is not merely a distant vision but a tangible reality—a future made in Australia. It is a future that will be forged through innovation, driven by resilience and built on the pillars of opportunity and inclusion. This government believes in creating pathways for every Australian to access the jobs of tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government is ready to support the transformative power of technology and innovation. We aim to foster an environment where 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030 become a reality, empowering individuals and propelling our economy forward. We understand the urgency of the skills crisis gripping our nation. Digital skills are essential to jobs across industries now and into the future. That's why this government announced the Digital and Tech Skills Working Group to take forward the compact, for industry, government and unions to work together. The working group outlined an earn-while-you-learn model, to support workers entering the tech industry to take on entry-level tech roles through a blend of employment and formal training, and includes how such models could support diversity in the existing tech-related workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is considering the working group's advice. To support this progress we've introduced free-fee TAFE, bridging the skills gap to inspire and upskill Australians towards crucial sectors such as agriculture, care, construction, technology, space innovation and defence. Yet opposition voices continue to neglect the transformative impact of successful education and training. This government understands that investing in our people is an investment in our nation's future. By collaborating across sectors we're ensuring that the workforce is equipped to thrive in a digitally-driven world. We're not just creating jobs. We're fostering diversity in STEM fields, making sure the voices of women and Indigenous communities are heard loud and clear. These groups have been underrepresented for far too long.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our National Quantum Strategy signifies our leap into the forefront of cutting-edge technologies, while responsible

       <p>
        As I was saying, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, voted against by the opposition, is our cornerstone for manufacturing. It is a foundation upon which industries will flourish, creating secure, well-paid jobs and driving economic growth. This week, with the launch of the Industry Growth Program, we welcome a new chapter for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
         SME
        </a>
        s, providing the means for ideas to materialise, innovations to thrive and businesses to grow. It was this government that closed the deal on the Technology Safeguards Agreement with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        . This agreement is a big deal for the Australian space sector, for the launch sector and for supporting services like transport and logistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        and the member for Adelaide, I've watched as this industry has grown and grown, starting with the thriving hub for space innovation in the heart of my electorate. I take every opportunity to get out there and hear about the sector from experts, with over 90 space organisations in the electorate of Adelaide. We know that, for many young Australians, space is an inspiring gateway to study and to work. That's why it was incredibly exciting that Katherine Bennell-Pegg, an employee of the Australian Space Agency, became the first Australian-born woman to represent our nation in astronaut training with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         European Space Agency
        </a>
        . Through role models like Katherine, we can encourage more of our young people to pursue STEM related careers. We're not just shaping the future; we're shaping a future made for everyone—an inclusive, innovative and prosperous Australia. The choice is clear. This government stands for progress while the opposition lingers in the shadows of missed opportunities. Let us build, let us innovate and let us propel Australia into a future where possibilities are boundless and opportunities are limitless.

          </small>
          <p>
           This motion is very important. The goal of 1.2 million tech related jobs by 2030 is a noble and important one. Unfortunately, making a commitment is the first step, but having and delivering a plan to do that is the most important step. There are some things that this government needs to do to make sure we can deliver these 1.2 million tech related jobs. The first is to appoint a minister for the digital economy. A minister for the digital economy will do two important things: firstly, it will send a signal to the industry, to the market and to investors that the government is serious about this industry and these opportunities; and, secondly—and crucially—it will develop the strategy needed to make sure we have a plan. The former government had a minister for the digital economy and a 2030 strategy that was being implemented to make a difference. I continue to call on the government to appoint a minister for the digital economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are other things that could be done that aren't being done. Again, with this government you hear a lot of announcements, but it's low on delivery. Not a dollar has been committed to get the Digital and Tech Skills Compact, which those opposite have talked about, off the ground. There was no line item in either the October 2022 or the May 2023 budget. Talking about how important it is is one thing, but putting the money behind it to get it up and running is crucial, and there is no money from this government for the Digital and Tech Skills Compact in the budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           Microcredentials are crucial when we are talking about upskilling Australians in the tech sector. In 2021, the former coalition had the Job-ready Graduates Package, which included $4.2 million for the microcredentials marketplace. We don't hear anything from this government about microcredentials, but it is crucial when it comes to tech and innovation. Let's use cyber as an example, but I could use any other industry in the tech sector. The reality is that many of the jobs in cyber that are needed today didn't exist when I graduated 15 years ago or when others graduated 15 to 20 years ago. If we want those people to re-skill, they do not have the ability to spend four years out of the marketplace, because they've got homes, families and financial commitments. Microcredentials allow them to get and continue to build the skills that they need to then work in these tech companies. It is something that is crucial for innovation and for getting these tech related jobs up and running.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite will talk about the National Quantum Strategy, which was announced in May. But, again, there is no new funding for this strategy; there is no action at all. We're seeing the trend, whether it's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI" rel="nofollow">
            AI
           </a>
           , which I'll get to, or whether it's quantum, where there are a lot of announcements, but there's no money behind them and there's no action, which is frustrating industry. AI is a great example of where there is a lot of talk by this government. The minister in February this year at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFR" rel="nofollow">
            AFR
           </a>
           Workforce Summit said that they would develop a national strategy on AI. We're about to enter December, and it's crickets from this government around AI. They released a discussion paper. Disappointingly, with that discussion paper, its scope talked about the risks of AI—which we need to mitigate—but did not include looking at the opportunities that AI brings. At a time when productivity is falling through the floor, how can we not look at the opportunities for productivity in the economy and for business through AI? It's December, and we've heard nothing from this government, and industry is frustrated. Industry has had to resort to using the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
            EU
           </a>
           legislation and regulations on AI because it knows that they're as tough and as hard as they can get. So they work off that platform and they know that they should, hopefully, be safe into the future. This is the reality. We're asking businesses to invest in jobs, in innovation and in AI, without having any certainty around the requirements from the government. They will talk a lot about the importance of this, but they're not delivering.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'll quickly finish by talking about the National Reconstruction Fund.
          </p>
          <p>
           I do notice, with the motion from those opposite, that there has been a cut. The $15 billion has been cut to $1.5 billion, so I'm assuming the Treasurer signed off on that, showing a bit more economic responsibility. It is off budget, so I'm surprised he's cut it to $1.5 billion. Again, there's a big announcement by those opposite but nothing's happening. I was talking to someone who should qualify for the National Reconstruction Fund and is looking for capital. He said: 'Nothing's been done. I've got no clarity. It's two to three years before I can even look at the National Reconstruction Fund.' They talk a big game around tech and digital, but they are not delivering anything for the industry.

            I'm pleased to speak in support of this motion. The previous speaker was complaining about no money. Honestly—there was $392 million in the Industry Growth Program to support Australian small and medium-sized enterprises to commercialise their ideas and grow their businesses, and there were billions of dollars announced in relation to the National Reconstruction Fund to help Australia capture new, high-value market opportunities, and the member opposite voted against it in parliament! Don't complain about the fact that there's no money there, when you actually voted against the allocation of the money.

            I thank the member for Adelaide. You only have to walk past his office here in Canberra to see the iconic

That's a company that was formed in 1910, and I thank the member for Adelaide for what he's done.    Historically, Adelaide was a manufacturing powerhouse, although the former coalition government did its best to kill a lot of that by gutting the car industry, for example, goading it to leave, which is exactly what the car industry did.

           <p>
            Unlike those opposite, we want to see a future made in Australia. We believe it should be a country that makes things again. The fact is we have all the ingredients here. We've got the people, the capability and the natural resources to compete with the best in the world to produce new products, technology and research. We've hit the ground running, putting in place programs and reforms to diversify our economy, boost our sovereign capability and create a new pipeline of well-paid jobs now and in the future, especially in outer suburban and regional communities like mine.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I mentioned before, the new $392 million Industry Growth Program, which the Minister for Industry and Science announced this morning, is delivering advice and capital support for small firms to help turn ideas into growing businesses. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund—that was the amount announced in the parliament and in the bill that we passed—is a co-investment fund that's about adding value to our natural strengths and comparative advantages across seven national priorities, through a mix of loans, guarantees and equity injections. We're committing a huge amount of money across that space. We released Australia's first National Quantum Strategy to support an industry estimated to be worth $2.2 billion, directly employing 8,700 people by 2030.

            </a>
            . We want Australians to take the opportunity to get the skills, including in the priority areas of technology and digital. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition described our fee-free TAFE places as wasteful spending. A total of 215,000 Australians took it up within six months, and we've committed ourselves, from January next year, to another 300,000 places. We're going to make sure people in the outer suburbs of major cities and places like Ipswich in my electorate have the tools to access the jobs of the future in industry and manufacturing. We know when we add value we create jobs and stronger businesses. That's exactly why programs like the NRF and the Industry Growth Program exist—to support those great local businesses.

            Capral, in my electorate, is a world-leading firm and a terrific example of this. It was great to have taken Minister Ed Husic on a tour of their factory at Bundamba a few months ago. Capral produces aluminium for a wide range of products, both for local customers and for export, from window frames to truck beds. The thing is aluminium will also be important in our transition to a net zero future. It's used in frames found in the solar panels being installed across the country.

           <p>
            Another example is Graphene Manufacturing Group, based in Richlands—in the Speaker's electorate of Oxley, the neighbouring electorate to mine—an innovative firm at the forefront of our national critical minerals and Australian-made battery industry. This site employs over 40 people and is experimenting to develop batteries that charge 70 times faster and have three times the battery life of lithium batteries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, medical science is a huge growth industry in my electorate. For example, developers like Springfield City Group in Ipswich have been working with a wide range of partners to develop the Springfield BioPark, an innovative precinct dedicated to advanced manufacturing of high-value medicines like vaccine and blood products. So there's a lot going on. We've taken initiative, and those opposite should get on board.

             I am very passionate about a future made in Australia, which is in the terms of the motion before us. But, regrettably, I am in a great state of fear about one of the most exciting future industry opportunities in this country, and that is continuous naval shipbuilding centred in my home city of Adelaide. We've heard very frightening rumours in our media about the Hunter Class Frigate Program being potentially on the chopping block. The

             to the United Kingdom,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             —who also undertook the Defence Strategic Review—apparently claimed at an event in London that the program should be scaled back dramatically and possibly even acquired out of Glasgow shipyards instead of Adelaide shipyards. There will be no future made in Australia if this government isn't committed to continuous naval shipbuilding in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The opportunity has been there for the defence minister, the Prime Minister and others to rule out ridiculous speculation of purchasing significant naval capital vessels from other shipyards outside Australia. The silence has been absolutely deafening, and it is very concerning that it seems clear the government is considering dramatic changes to the naval shipbuilding program here in Australia, centred in my home city of Adelaide. It would be very easy to rule out any of these wild rumours and claims, but the fact that they're not being ruled out unfortunately seems to confirm that they are under active consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
             Naval shipbuilding is one of the most complex industry sectors. It is absolutely at the forefront of future technology. The skills acquired in the naval shipbuilding sector, and in the defence sector more broadly, are extremely interchangeable with other exciting future industries—space and cyber. Space has been gutted. This government has ripped money out of investing in space, with satellites cancelled et cetera. The space sector is completely reeling because, under the previous government, we established the Australian Space Agency—which, of course, is headquartered in my home city of Adelaide—and we had an enormous program around investing in space and space technology but the new government has ripped all of that away. So 'a future made in Australia', while we're ripping money out of the space sector and putting a huge question mark over continuous shipbuilding in this country, is an oxymoron.

             submarine program. I am a huge supporter of acquiring nuclear propulsion technology for the Navy, but it's vitally important that we're building those submarines and that we have that sovereign capability in Australia. What seems clear now is that the government will not commit to any form of minimum content—local industry content—in submarines, and there are claims and brags coming out of the UK that they expect to build these nuclear submarines all up in Barrow-in-Furness for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Australian Navy
             </a>
             . We already know the government has conceded that the first few submarines will probably be purchased from the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, for the future AUKUS submarine as it's developed, we know that this government is spending billions of dollars to upgrade shipyards in the United States and the United Kingdom and putting billions of dollars into these programs to help them build submarines. If it were to transpire that the Australian taxpayer was paying the English to develop a capability to build submarines for us in lieu of our own workforce doing it here in Australia, that would be absolutely scandalous.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're here to debate a motion about future industry and a future made in Australia, but I fear that the most significant, complex production in the history of this country—a nuclear submarine—is at risk if this government doesn't make very clear the minimum content and what's going to happen in Australia. It's at risk of possibly drifting through to being produced somewhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
             That would be absolutely scandalous.
            </p>
            <p>
             I take this opportunity to invite the government to commit to what they promised at the last election when it comes to continuous shipbuilding in Australia. We should be building frigates out at Osborne, with the Hunter program through
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
              BAE
             </a>
             , and we should be building offshore patrol vessels at Henderson in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia
             </a>
             . There's a question mark over that now, and there are suggestions that we will possibly be acquiring vessels out of Spain, from Navantia. Walking away from those commitments is absolutely disgraceful, and we want to see some guarantees in this debate that those jobs are going to be right here in Australia so that we will have a future made in Australia.
