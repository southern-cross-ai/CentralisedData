        Do you love fishing? If so, Sunday is your special day. It is Australia's national Gone Fishing Day, the best reason yet to go for a fish. Even more importantly, this year Gone Fishing Day is coming to Busselton in my electorate. Not only has the WA Minister for Fisheries Joe Francis made it a licence-free day; he has also delayed the annual west coast bioregion demersal finfish closure for 48 hours. The Geographe Camping &amp; Tackle World and the Naturaliste Game &amp; Sport Fishing Club are busy planning and will run the event in Busselton. What they are really hoping is that people who have never fished before take up this opportunity to have a go, to experience just what it is like to catch a fish or two. They are running a fishing competition, and there will be plenty of prizes, so we are encouraging everyone to get along and have a go this Sunday. Otherwise, why not just get your family and friends together and simply go fishing? Some of my best memories as a child were holidays spent early morning beach fishing with my Little Jim fishing rod, catching sand whiting, or evenings spent fishing under the Mandurah bridge.

        The national Gone Fishing Day initiative started with a conversation between fishing mates that has grown to become what is now a major national community event. Given that an estimated five million Australians are enjoying recreational fishing every year, there are now 100 registered Gone Fishing Day events across Australia. Busselton is just one of them. There will be a range of events to choose from: kids and family fishing events, fishing events for the disabled, events for those with mental illness and those recovering from trauma, events cleaning up our waterways and improving habitat for fishing, and fishing tournaments for the most experienced anglers. Have a look on their website for an event near you.
       </p>
       <p>
        And there will be thousands of other Australians who simply use Sunday as just another day to go fishing with family and friends just because they love fishing and it is a great day out.

        I note that there will be a fun fish-off between federal fisheries minister Anne Ruston and

        There is something uniquely and inherently Australian about going fishing. As a nation surrounded by water, it is part of our way of life. Can you remember how excited you were the first time you caught a fish? Have you been on the beach and heard the excitement of other young kids when they catch their first fish? It is just an extraordinary experience. I know many people in my own communities in my electorate go fishing because it actually makes them feel good. They relax. The peace and what it brings to their life is extraordinary.

        In Busselton the longest jetty in WA is an iconic fishing spot. It is great for every fisher. It does not really matter what age you are. That is where you could catch some squid or some
