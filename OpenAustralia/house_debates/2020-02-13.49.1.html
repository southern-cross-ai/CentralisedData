        The centenary countdown has well and truly begun for Rotary in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        , as these organisations will celebrate the first 100 years of service in 2021. This is no ordinary celebration. The year 2021 will mark 100 years of all Rotary organisations across Australia providing service to others, promoting integrity and advancing world understanding, goodwill and peace through their fellowship of business, professional and community leaders. In 1921 four Rotary clubs were createdâ€”in Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington and Sydney. From there Rotary and Rotaract clubs were created everywhere across Australia and New Zealand.

        Rotary partners work with other well-established organisations to achieve great things and believe that they have a shared responsibility to take action on the world's most persistent issues, such as promoting peace; fighting disease; providing clean water, sanitation and hygiene; saving mothers and children; supporting education; and growing local economies. Recently I spoke with the Caboolture Rotary club about the key areas of concern affecting our area. This group of hardworking locals from all walks of life are testament to the Rotary movement. Special mention goes to

        , a Rotarian for 42 years. At this meeting we discussed creating more jobs, which will help address the scourge of drugs and crime in our electorate. It's terrific how much they care about the people of Longman and their community. We should remember to be grateful that we have wonderful organisations like Rotary in our community every day. Don't wait until next year; help your local Rotary club now to kick off a bright new era.
