       <p class="italic">
        Further to the answer to question in writing No. 99 (House Hansard, 14 October 2019, page 203):(1) In respect of the answer to part (1) of the question: (a) what happened to in-service emissions testing that stopped in 2008; and (b) how can Australia adequately track its vehicle emissions without actual measurements, especially considering its unique international position on issues such as fleet characteristics and fuel quality.(2) In respect of the answer to part (2) of the question, why have there been no updates regarding national air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles for base years beyond 2010.(3) In respect of the answer to part (3) of the question, have any new policy measures focused on more effective control of real-world emissions; if so, what are they and can details be provided.(4) In respect of the answer to parts (4) and (5) of the question: (a) is it a fact that a draft regulation impact statement was released in 2016 that clearly identified net benefits of introduction of Euro 6 emission standards; (b) what is the reason that the Government is still 'considering' this issue three years later; (c) what does the Government mean by 'considering'; (d) is there an agreed process with clear timelines to progress policy; and (e) can a clarification be provided as to exactly who is being consulted, and when this has happened or will happen.(5) In respect of the answer to part (6) of the question, how does the Government plan to respond to claims that current Australian fuel (petrol) quality will create technological issues for owners of Euro 6 technology cars?

         Mr Taylor: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The Hon Michael McCormack MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development is leading this work, and questions are best addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) In May 2019, the Department of the Environment and Energy published the latest release of the National Inventory Report along with updated data for Australia's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNFCCC" rel="nofollow">
          UNFCCC
         </a>
         Inventory (ageis.climatechange.gov.au/UNFCCC.aspx). The UNFCCC Inventory includes national road transportation emissions trends to 2017 for the following (as well as other) gases:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         For the first time, the 2019 release of Australia's UNFCCC Inventory included road transportation emissions trends from 2009 to 2017 for:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department of the Environment and Energy will continue to track road transportation emissions for the above gases in future years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The methods underpinning the estimates for road transportation are set out in Australia's National Inventory Report 2017 (volumes 1 and 3):

        <p class="italic">
         (3) The Hon Michael McCormack MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development is leading this work, and questions are best addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Manufacturers that have concerns about the suitability of current Australian market fuels are able to specify the use of a higher grade of fuel (eg 95 RON) as a condition of warranty.
