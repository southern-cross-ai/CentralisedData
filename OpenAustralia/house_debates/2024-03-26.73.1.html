        My question is to the Prime Minister. A year after the storm and flood disaster hit Eugowra, Molong, Canowindra, Cudal and Manildra in central-western

        , the state and federal governments each stumped up $50 million to support four local government areas. It's become very clear that this amount will not be enough. With the federal budget looming, our communities are requesting further financial support, including for housing, so that nobody is left behind. Will your government answer those calls and deliver further funding?

         I thank the member for Calare for his question, and I thank him as well for hosting my visit to Eugowra on Friday. Previously, the member for Calare had asked me to return. It's a site I went to in 2022—a community that was devastated by these terrible floods, as were many areas in the member for Riverina's seat, the member for Page's and others more recently, which I visited on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

         and

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         All up, we've delivered some $600 million for flood relief, including, of course, in Eugowra. That included $20 million from each level of government for the Resilient Homes Program in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">

         . We've supported the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         Reconstruction Authority to consult with councils and the local community on a buyback program there—a buyback program that's in place in Lismore in the electorate of Page. We've also provided for a share of the $25 million Community Assets Program, and I've spoken to Kevin Beatty, the mayor of that shire, about applications there.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I was in Eugowra, I think we met just about everyone in that town. They are brave, resilient people, and I pay tribute to them.
        </p>

         I thank Kay and Max for welcoming us into their home, which has been rebuilt. You can see the watermark on their property. They lost most of their possessions in the floods. They weren't insured. But they used some grant money, as well as a small mortgage they took out on their house, to repair and rebuild. They moved into that home last year, just before Christmas, and they are just terrific people. They're typical of the people who we met in the main street. There was a vintage car exhibition on in the main street last Friday night, and therefore there were a lot of people around, and we engaged with them and consulted with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We'll continue to work with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government. I thank the member for the genuine representations that he has made on behalf of individual constituents but also on behalf of his communities. At the worst of times, we see the best of the Australian character, and I certainly saw that with the people who I met in Eugowra last week. We will work with the New South Wales government, who, of course, run the Reconstruction Authority, on what further can be done. On all of these issues, I don't regard them as partisan issues. I go into electorates when I'm asked to, and we provide what assistance we can. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues with the member for Calare.
