       <p>
        In recent months I have enjoyed supporting a number of local sports games and local sports clubs watching high-quality netball. It was a pleasure to attend the

         St Michael's
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Angels" rel="nofollow">
         All Angels
        </a>
        Netball Club and the Grange Baptist Uniting Netball Club presentation dinners recently. As a proud supporter of both clubs, it was great to see both finished off the season with a number of premierships.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Michael's and All Angels held their end-of-season event recently and, as a club sponsor, I was fortunate to be able to present the Diamond Award to Madeline Cole for her 14 years continuous service to the netball club. I was honoured to join Michelle Diamond, whom the award is named after, to present this award to a very deserving recipient. The presentation ceremony was a wonderful evening. Congratulations to Bronwyn Britcher, Amanda Durbin, John McGeagh, the hard-working committee and the club on a great year.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the same night, I was also fortunate to present medallions to the Grange Uniting Netball Club's Lorna Godfrey Shield winners for the 2015 season. Lorna Godfrey is a true legend of the Grange Uniting Netball Club. She was one of club's inaugural players, umpire, coach and committee member. It was another great evening with hundreds of people in attendance. I would like to acknowledge President Jim Davis and congratulate him and the Grange Baptist Uniting Netball Club on their success in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to also pay tribute to the Sparkling Diamonds Netball Club at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Park" rel="nofollow">

        on their efforts this season and especially acknowledge their success in welcoming migrants to their teams. At one of the games I saw a few weeks ago, it was wonderful to see girls from Africa enjoy their game of netball. Well done to all clubs.
