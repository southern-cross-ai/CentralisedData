         South Perth
        </a>
        passed away recently. He was born 3 March 1946 and passed away 24 October 2015. I recently attended his funeral. Mike worked on my campaigns in 2007, in 2010 and in 2013. Michael was originally from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and with that Anzac spirit today, it is convenient that I mention him. He actually worked for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZ" rel="nofollow">
         ANZ
        </a>
        bank and became the WA state manager many years ago. Following his time in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , he, like myself, chose to live in the beautiful state of Western Australia. Michael was a fanatical sport lover and he dearly loved the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Blacks" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        â€”he would have been wrapped that they won the World Cup.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mike filled many roles in the community and he worked tirelessly for community groups. One of the roles he filled was as Treasurer at the local golf club for many years. Michael also sat on many boards, including Gindalbie. He also acted as a mentor and one of the most famous people he mentored was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Morris" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who was captain of the successful Australian women's hockey team, which won gold in Atlanta and in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is survived by his beautiful wife Jan and son Darryl along with Darryl's wife and two grandchildren. I know in Mike's funeral program he had some quotes from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
         Abraham Lincoln
        </a>
        . Being a good conservative, one of the things I know he would love to me say here is: you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich; and you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.
