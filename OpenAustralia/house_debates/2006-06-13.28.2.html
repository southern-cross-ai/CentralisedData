        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Freehills, the government’s law firm of choice, which helped draft the government’s industrial relations changes. Is the Prime Minister aware that, in a presentation in February this year, Freehills concludes that the average annual wage increase between June 2004 and June 2005 for employees on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        s was 2.5 per cent—the same as the inflation rate? Is the Prime Minister also aware that Freehills concludes that average annual wage increases over the same period were in non-union collective agreements, 3.5 per cent; in agreements generally, four per cent; and, in union collective agreements, 4.3 per cent? Prime Minister, isn’t it the case that the government’s own hired legal gun says that AWAs will deliver lower wages than collective agreements?

         I have not seen or been briefed on that particular presentation, but I have seen and been briefed on the Bureau of Statistics, which publishes a survey every two years of employee earnings and hours. The results from the most recent survey, conducted in mid-2004, became available earlier this year. This survey allows a comparison to be made between the earnings of individuals on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
          AWA
         </a>
         s and those on registered collective agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The published data showed that the average weekly total earnings of employees working under AWAs are on average 13 per cent higher than for those employees covered by certified agreements. Both managerial and non-managerial employees on AWAs have higher average total earnings than equivalent employees on certified agreements. Managerial employees on AWAs have earnings that are on average 19 per cent higher than those on collective agreements. The earnings of non-managerial employees on AWAs are on average five per cent higher than those on collective agreements. These comparisons are made on the basis of average weekly total earnings as opposed to ordinary time earnings. It is entirely appropriate to make the comparison as traditional rigid employment categories, such as full time, part time and casual, are less common in AWAs, where a premium is placed on flexibility. A focus on weekly take-home pay recognises that many employees on AWAs enjoy greater flexibility in the hours they work.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have a message for the people of Australia who are enjoying the enhanced benefits of AWAs: the Leader of the Opposition is after your aspirational prosperity. The Leader of the Opposition wants to dent your aspirational spirit. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip away the incentives now available to you under the system. The Leader of the Opposition wants to take you back to the backwoods of industrial relations in this country, to a system that presided over more than a million Australians being without a job.

          My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and follows on from the answer given by the Prime Minister to the previous question. Would the minister advise the House of additional and particular benefits enjoyed by employees currently privileged to be on Australian workplace agreements? Further, is the minister aware of any threats to these particular benefits?

          <p>
           I thank the member for Fisher for his question. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, according to the official
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Bureau of Statistics
           </a>
           data, employees on Australian workplace agreements earn, on average, 13 per cent more than employees covered by certified agreements. If you compare those individuals on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
            AWA
           </a>
           s with those on the instrument of choice of the Labor Party, the award, those on AWAs earn, on average, 100 per cent more than those who are on awards.
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Fisher asked me whether there are any threats to these benefits which are enjoyed by Australians on individual agreements. There are indeed threats, and those threats come from the labour movement in Australia, who want to abolish Australian workplace agreements, who want to rip away, from these Australians who are better off, those benefits that they have obtained under Australian workplace agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, in return for $50 million worth of funding from the unions over the last 10 years to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party

           , we had this craven caving in by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend, a caving in to the unions in Australia which has been almost universally condemned in the media today. For example, in the

                I was asked about threats, and these threats have been highlighted in almost every major newspaper in Australia today. The

                Every major newspaper in Australia has condemned this weak response by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend—simply doing their bidding in return for $50 million from the unions in Australia. What is next? Have we got the secret accord coming along? Already we have the union leaders in

                In relation to these matters, as the Prime Minister said, the reality for Australians is this: a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate announced last week, the first time in 30 years that unemployment has gone under five per cent in Australia. What we had under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the employment minister, was 11 per cent unemployment—

                     This side of the parliament is interested in jobs for all Australians. That is why we put in place economic reforms that have driven down the unemployment rate from the 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment to 4.9 per cent. That is why this side of the parliament has seen a 16.8 per cent increase in real wages compared to 1.2 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. There could be no more stark contrast in relation to this matter, and a government interested in—

                       My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister again to Freehills, the government’s law firm of choice, which helped draft the government’s industrial relations law. Is the Prime Minister aware that, in its presentation in February this year, Freehills said that 20 per cent of employees are paid on awards, 40 per cent of employees are on collective agreements, 20 to 25 per cent have individual arrangements—common-law contracts—and 2.4 per cent are on
