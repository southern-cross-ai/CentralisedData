        Today I acknowledge the many wonderful Australians in my electorate of Reid who received due recognition at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        celebrations this year. Just as we celebrate the citizenship of people from so many different corners of the globe who have made Australia their home, we celebrate the diversity of talents that make Australia such a wonderful place to live. While we can be proud of the mateship we see displayed in times of hardship and tragedy, there are many Australians who show us that spirit and determination are characteristics we should display every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the three constituents who received national recognition for their outstanding service: Mrs Aileen Mary Morris
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for her service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church
        </a>
        and to aged persons; Ms Maureen Houssein-Mustafa OAM for her service to vocational education plus training to the community; and Mr Andrew George McCallum AM for his service to the community in a range of leadership roles in the social justice sector, particularly supporting the welfare of children and their families. These people who received awards for their outstanding community and personal endeavours are a stark reminder that, irrespective of our beginnings or our backgrounds, we can use our talents to make Australia a better place.

        At the local Canada Bay Council Australia Day Ceremony, Mayor Angelo Tsirekas presented the Citizen of the Year Award to Mr Joe Di Giacomo of Abbotsford. Mr Di Giacomo has been a community leader for so many years, strengthening and supporting the Italian culture through his active involvement in language classes and events. Mr Di Giacomo is also well known for his involvement with the commissioning of the statue

        , which is sited in

        Auburn council awarded its Young Citizen of the Year 2011 to Mr Mohamed Taha for his most recent efforts to raise money for a young man suffering from bone cancer.
