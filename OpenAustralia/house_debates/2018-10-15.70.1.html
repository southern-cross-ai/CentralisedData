        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how strong economic management allows this government to invest in regional Australia, help make our roads safer and boost productivity? What are the risks and what is at stake if our plan to invest in regional roads and productivity is not delivered?

         I'm delighted to take this question from the member for Dawson, a very hardworking Queenslander, somebody who understands that, when the regions are strong, so too is our nation. He's getting on with the job of lobbying and agitating for the roads that he wants in his electorate and he's doing a darn fine job there too.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know, on this side of the House, that good economic management helps small businesses grow. Small businesses are those great employers, those wonderful businesses who get behind our nation and our regions, particularly in the member for Dawson's electorate. Good economic management helps creates jobs. A million jobs were created in the first five years of our government. Good economic management enables us to invest in the roads and the infrastructure that regional Australia wants, needs, demands and, best of all and most of all, deserves. That's exactly what this government is doing.
        </p>

         On the weekend I announced the guidelines in Manjimup, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , for the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. It's a $3.5 billion investment in making country roads safer. Whether it's the first mile or the last mile or all those in between, it's going to make sure that the needs of our freight task, which is expected to double by 2030, are addressed. It's an investment to boost productivity, as the member for Dawson full-well knows, to get people home sooner and safer, to help get the mining wealth, the food and the fibre to our ports and to our markets. We're growing our markets. The trade minister and his assistant minister are doing an outstanding job in that regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is also a specific $1.5 billion investment in northern Australia, making sure that the north continues its critical role in boosting the productivity of our nation. It follows our $10 billion investment in that marvellous 1,679 kilometre road, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         , finally ending the talk and delivering the highway that Queenslanders, and indeed all the nation, needs. I know how important that $800 million for the Cooroy to Curra section is for the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         . It is delivering the Mackay Ring Road stage 1 and the Haughton River Bridge upgrade projects, totalling more than a billion dollars. I spoke to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyn_McLaughlin" rel="nofollow">
          Lyn McLaughlin
         </a>
         , the mayor up there, just last week, when I was with the member for Dawson. She knows how important that is. She also knows—as does the member for Dawson—about the Bowen Road Bridge, a $3.3 million investment from the federal government at Townsville.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Dawson and the coalition government, the Liberals and Nationals, understand that all this will go to waste if those opposite ever get into government. The Building Better Regions Fund, the Roads of Strategic Importance, the beef roads initiative—they'll all go to waste; they'll all be dropped and stopped if ever those opposite get into government. Woe betide them if ever that happens!
