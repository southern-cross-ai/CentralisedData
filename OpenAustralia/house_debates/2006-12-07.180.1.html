        In partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Dili, the Rotary Club of Warringah, which operates in my electorate, has raised $260,000 for long-lasting insecticide treated mosquito bed nets for our troubled neighbour, Timor, in its fight against malaria. These funds have been raised with the assistance of District 9680 plus Rotary Against Malaria, 27 Rotary clubs in Australia and one in Canada. In addition, 42 individuals, other service clubs and corporations have donated funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the Rotary International Humanitarian Grants Program, matching grants enlarged the coffers significantly. The target of 20,000 bed nets was exceeded and the funds raised will purchase over 30,000â€”enough to fill three shipping containers. Some 60,000 displaced people are in refugee camps, many with no homes to go back to. As the risk of malaria, dengue fever and other diseases is extreme for people living in makeshift accommodation, and with the wet season about to start, the delivery of our bed nets will be very timely. With the cooperation of the members of the Rotary Club of Dili and the government of Timor-Leste Department of Health, the distribution will be in good hands. Due to the unrest in Dili, the need for more nets is paramount. The members of Rotary are ever mindful of this and hope to continue the program.
       </p>
       <p>
        These magnificent facts have been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a member of Warringah Rotary, Mr Clive Mellor. I would like to acknowledge his commitment to Rotary and to this project.
