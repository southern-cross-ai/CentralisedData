        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is increasing support to victims of domestic and family violence, including through the pandemic?

         I commend the member for Curtin for her question, and for her career before coming into this place as a university professor, a vice-chancellor and a champion of education for women. The Morrison government is committed to addressing all forms of family, domestic and sexual violence—a goal I know we share with all members in this place. Through the budget, we've committed $1.1 billion to addressing women's safety—the largest ever commitment by a Commonwealth government and a down payment on the next National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Part of this budget was $146 million over two years to support women to leave a violent relationship, through a new payment, the Escaping Violence Payment—one-off and up to $5,000 per person.
        </p>
        <p>
         This budget measure is critical to support women leaving a violent situation and to help them get back on their feet. It will provide immediate financial assistance, because we know that financial insecurity is a key barrier to women leaving a violent relationship and one of the reasons why women return to an abusive partner. Research does show that it often takes a woman several attempts to leave a relationship permanently. In 2017, it was reported 64 per cent of women have experienced violence by a previous partner and had left and returned at least once.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a critical period, when a woman's safety is at its lowest. As women attest, you lose your identity; you believe the lies you're told; you're isolated; you question whether you can even live an independent life. And you need immediate help and support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, this payment won't be a

         payment, it won't be means tested, it won't affect any Centrelink payments an individual may already be receiving and it won't count as income for tax purposes. It's estimated the Escaping Violence Payment will help 12,000 people annually. It will be able to be complemented with the

         stream of the no-interest loan scheme, up to $2,000, and provide women with additional financial assistance, again on top of any social security payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've listened to calls for further funding on top of the government's $130 million investment under the existing national partnership during COVID. We've committed an additional $260 million over two years to help state and territory governments to support their frontline domestic, family and sexual violence services. Also, another $343 million was previously committed under the fourth action plan, which is concluding. The Morrison government's sound economic position allows us to deliver jobs and guarantee essential services but also to make sure that we support women when they're at their most vulnerable and invest carefully in their safety.
