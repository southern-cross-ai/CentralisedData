        </a>
        Basketball Competition tipped off last month in stellar fashion. Teams from right across the Mid West from towns such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Magnet" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Magnet
        </a>
        , Morawa, Mullewa and Mingenew participated in this summer's maiden round. The alcohol and drug-free competition has grown by leaps and bounds from its first round last season, when it had only three new teams on court. Over 220 people spilled into the Mullewa Recreation Centre, with a record amount of children watching the day's festivities. Thirty women and 90 men pulled on a jersey throughout the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Who Care, who defeated Mount Magnet in a nailbiter in overtime in the women's. Mullewa defeated reigning champions Mount Magnet by one point in a thriller in the men's—a great achievement by the Mullewa boys, who knocked off a very worthy opponent in Mount Magnet, who were previously undefeated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locals from across the mid-west are looking forward to the second round of the season on Sunday at the Mullewa Recreation Centre, starting at 9am. The competition has become a massive highlight for hundreds of people throughout the mid-west. I am very proud that there are a number of Indigenous players—men and women. It is only made possible by the dedicated hard work of mental health worker Glen Fleeton from 360.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the time remaining, I would like to take the opportunity to wish all the good people of Durack a very happy and merry Christmas. May we see them in 2017, and may they have a very happy and prosperous 2017.
