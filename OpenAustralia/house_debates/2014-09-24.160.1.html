       <p>
        I rise today to mark a very special occasion. The Lions Club of Crestwood in my electorate recently celebrated 20 years of service to the community. It was a great privilege for me to attend this event as an honorary member of the club. This club was chartered on 3 September 1994 as part of Lions District 201N5. This 20 years of service was marked with all of the significant members from those years attending and reminiscing on all the great contributions they have made to the community—and on the great times, fun and laughs that they have had. This club honoured and thanked their members for their hard work and generous spirit. The electorate of Mitchell has so many service clubs and voluntary service people along the lines of Crestwood Lions, and I really appreciate their contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funds the club have raised over the past 20 years amount to over a quarter of a million dollars. They have supported numerous Lions foundations and charities: medical research, hospital facilities, disaster-relief appeals, special-education schools, the homeless, the elderly, the sick, Scouts, Guides, youth groups, Men's Sheds, women's refuges, equipment for the disabled, medical equipment and much more. This is really our society at its best, when individuals and individual communities—civil society—help each other, help themselves, rather than rely on the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really want to pay tribute to these selfless people, who do it simply for the joy of giving, simply for the joy of doing things for others, because they want a strong society and a strong community. This is the way we used to be and it is the way we need to be again to be a strong society. These people are the finest people because of all those groups they help and the difference they make in the lives of those in our community who are very sick and desperate. They make the difference—and they help without any expectation of a return other than a benefit to our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club has had a great set of laughs and experiences over the years. It was wonderful to be with all the former presidents. I will name a few of them, because they are all such exceptional community people: John and Kathy Ebbott, Elizabeth Lessells, Greg Dunn, Sue Groth,

        and Christine Andrews. There are so many more members and people that I cannot name today, but all of these former presidents for the past 20 years have really helped the community of Crestwood. It has come along in leaps and bounds. It was a pleasure to sit with the Kellyville Lions Club, as well, which founded the Crestwood Lions Club. I really valued the opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I want to say a big thankyou to all of the members and past presidents for the service they provide to our community. The founding of this club 20 years ago was a special moment, but the 20 years of service has provided so much benefit to our community. I appreciate all of the members and thank them for their time and service.
