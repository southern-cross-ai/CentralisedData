       <p>
        [by video link] Australians are really sick and tired of this government's hapless handling of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        . What we've seen today is Australia Post asking for employees to volunteer their time and use their cars to deliver mail. This is at the same time as Australia Post is cutting services across our communities. It is an absolute disgrace that this hapless minister allows this to happen. At the same time they're allowing Australia Post's executives to get bonuses and support. Millions of Australians are without work and this this government is supporting the top end of town.
       </p>
       <p>
        What needs to be made clear is that this is costing small businesses, businesses like Tom Joseph's in my electorate. He lost his business, because they can't guarantee express post. When it takes 14 days to go from Rowville across to Dawson we've got to say something's wrong. It's people's passports. It's their Medicare cards. I spoke to Donnie Whittleson this morning. He started getting his deposit for his hearing aid, because the mail arrived two days after the appointment. I've had bills arrive the day they're due, because of Australia Post cutting services.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not the people on the ground that have caused the issue. The posties have busted their backsides to get things done. It's the management of Australia Post, supported by the hapless minister of this pathetic government, that is causing the problem. People right across Victoria are screaming about the services that're being cut by Australia Post. Now they want to cut mail to every second day. You just cannot believe that this would be allowed at this time when people desperately need mail, and at the same time Australia Post are saying, 'We've never been busier.'
