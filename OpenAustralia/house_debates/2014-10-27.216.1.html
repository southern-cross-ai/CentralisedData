        Today I had the pleasure of welcoming some students from a local school in my electorate to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . The students and teachers from Bounty Boulevard State School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         North Lakes
        </a>
        really were delightful and they were certainly energetic and excited to learn more about the Commonwealth government and Parliament House. I have been to the school a couple of times since being elected and have got to know the students there. I went out there recently and presented an Australian flag during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flag_Day" rel="nofollow">
         National Flag Day
        </a>
        . They were very informed: they knew about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Cross
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Star" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Star
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack" rel="nofollow">
         Union Jack
        </a>
        â€”everything that makes up our flag. I also had a chance to go and watch the students perform at their recent musical,
        <i>
         Grease
        </i>
        , which was on at the local Axis Church in North Lakes. There really are some talented students. They did a fantastic job with the production of
        <i>
         Grease
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the teachers for their dedication to the children's education and I want to thank their parents for allowing them to come on this trip. Bounty Boulevard really is a fantastic school. The students had much to tell me about the committees and the results of the committees they are working on. I encourage those students to let me know the results of those committees so that I, along with the state member for Murrumba, Reg Gulley, and a local council in that area can look at those issues and help implement them for the students. I am proud to have hosted them today and I thank them for coming.
