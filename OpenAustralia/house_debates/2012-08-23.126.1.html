       <p>
        Today I would like to pay tribute to our soldiers who fought in the historic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        , a campaign that should never be forgotten in Australia's war history. Saturday, 18 August 2012 marked the 46th anniversary of when Australian platoons, numbering 108, were attacked by a force estimated to be more than 2,000. The bravery and resolve of the fighting spirit that Australian troops showed on that day is renowned. Such was the fighting spirit of our troops that, despite being outnumbered, our soldiers forced and advanced the enemy back and we held our position.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">
         The Battle
        </a>
        of Long Tan claimed the lives of only 18 soldiers and 24 were wounded. I commend each and every soldier for their service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this opportunity to recognise the service and the dedication of our Vietnam veterans. Australia's military involvement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        was the longest of any war in Australia's history and one that I hope will never be repeated.
       </p>
       <p>
        As proud Australians we reflect and remember the 500 Australians killed and the 3,129 wounded during this conflict. As a federal member of parliament and a father I feel it is a personal burden when our troops go to conflict zones around the world to assist and uphold our beliefs and the security of our nation. I pay my respects to the families and friends of our soldiers for their support. I would also like to acknowledge the soldiers who were unable to return or who did not return from the Battle of Long Tan and the Vietnam War, as well as the veterans who are still here with us today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate enough to attend a recent memorial morning service in Beaudesert and a dinner in Jimboomba to mark these occasions. I would like to recognise some of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        identities who work so hard for their colleagues and their local communities. These include the Beaudesert RSL President Errol Guilfoyle; Senior Vice-President Peter Higgins; President of the Jimboomba RSL sub-branch,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Short" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; plus notables such as Sandy Lloyd, Brett McCreadie, Don Pidgeon, Marcus Bruty and Gavin Thurlow. They work tirelessly in ensuring the community is aware and able to commemorate important military dates such as the Battle of Long Tan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans Day
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There are parts in our military history that we as a nation should not be proud of. The way that we welcomed back our Vietnam veterans is a blight on our history books. I am proud that we as a nation have matured when troops now return from battles, which we currently have with the conflict in areas of Afghanistan and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and that we do share a more heroic and thankful attribute with those brave men and women who serve and who offer a blanket of security that our nation sleeps under every night. We should always be cognisant of the sacrifice that our brave ADF personnel contribute. Lest we forget.
