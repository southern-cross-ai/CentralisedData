         I thank the Member for Aston for her question and for the extraordinary work that she's done in her short time here in this chamber as the best member for Aston in a very long period of time. I attended the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garma_Festival" rel="nofollow">
          Garma Festival
         </a>
         on the weekend. That is the major celebration of Indigenous culture held anywhere in this country. It's not, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested, some narrow fest. Indeed, the member for Berowra was there, as was the member for Calare. A number of crossbench members from the Greens and Independent members were there as well. It was an opportunity to listen to what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         were saying about these issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition has spoken about those places:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Palm Island
         </a>
         , Leonora, Laverton, East Arnhem Land and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         . He said that he's consulted Indigenous Australians. Well, this is what they have said about that. James Calyun, a Martu man from Meekatharra who was there in Leonora, said, 'No-one has actually spoken about the voice to us in those visits from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Dutton
         </a>
         .' Geraldine Hogarth, the local leader, said: 'He said, "Geraldine, I advise you to go for it. Say yes because you might have to wait for the next 100-plus years for another referendum."' That's what Geraldine says the Leader of the Opposition said to her.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Craig" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Craig
         </a>
         , the Mayor of Leonora, said, 'Peter Dutton wasn't there to talk about the voice.' In Central Australia,

          Central Land Council
         </a>
         , said, 'I will campaign for a big "yes" vote in the referendum because, when we are being heard, we will achieve positive change on the ground in Alice Springs and in the bush.' That's what he had to say. In Katherine,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Bush" rel="nofollow">

          Northern Land Council
         </a>
         , said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We say listen to us and we will help make thing better so we can close the gap.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We say listen to us before making policies that affect us.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Please stop ignoring us.

         He visited Palm Island, and this is what Elizabeth Clay, one of the elders, had to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All I knew about the visit of Peter Dutton and

         was a half an hour before they were about to board a bloody plane â€¦ He should [support the Voice] but we don't expect him to. He'll oppose everything.

          The Mayor
         </a>
         of Palm Island, Mislam Sam, said, 'I definitely support the Voice and going ahead.' East Arnhem Regional Council supports the policy position for the constitutional recognition of Indigenous people and a direct

         . They haven't listened to or consulted Indigenous Australians. They are attempting political advantage at their expense.
