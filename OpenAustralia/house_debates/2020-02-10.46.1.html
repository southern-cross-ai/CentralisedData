        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is working with Indonesia to provide regional leadership in tackling waste and its impact on the environment and our oceans?

         I thank the member for

         for his question. I congratulate President Widodo on his address to parliament today, his warm affirmation of friendship between Indonesia and Australia and his vision for Indonesia's fast-growing citiesâ€”in particular, for a green smart capital, which I understand will combine information and communications technology to manage public services, including waste management. I look forward to meeting with my Indonesian counterpart, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, to discuss her country's ambitious pledge to dramatically reduce the amount of plastic and other waste products entering their waters. Sadly, waste knows no borders when it comes to its impact on the environment and oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
         Next month, Australia is hosting a national plastics summit to support our target of phasing out problematic and unnecessary plastics, as we continue to work locally and in the region to find solutions to recover, recycle and remanufacture. Last year we announced a ban on the export of plastics, paper, glass and tyres, to be phased in from July this year. As the Prime Minister said, it's our waste; it's our responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge existing bilateral activities, such as the Australia Awards in Indonesia and its Tackling Marine Pollution Issues through Recycling Program, which is being run by

         . This important program was developed with members of the government of Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Program participants travelled to Australia and, over a two-week period, visited waste facilities, met with environment officials and shared best-practice knowledge. The practical, on-the-ground projects that were pitched will have a real impact on participants in local communities. Projects included the coastal community development project on plastic waste management in Jakarta and improving plastic waste collection through mini markets all over Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia and Indonesia are already strong partners, whether it be on plastic in the ocean or our international partnership on blue carbon. The sustainable growth and stability that will flow from our comprehensive economic partnership announced today both tackles waste and cleans up the oceans.
