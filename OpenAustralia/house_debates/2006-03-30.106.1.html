        I rise to share with the House some observations about a remarkable woman named Lisbeth Ann Montgomerie, or Lisbeth Ann Neill after she was married. Mrs Neill was born on 3 August 1924. As a young girl she attended

        Corowa in Melbourne. After she left school she began her working life as a personal secretary to and ballet teacher for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edouard_Borovansky" rel="nofollow">
         Edouard Borovansky
        </a>
        and the Borovansky Ballet Company. When the war came, Mrs Neill made a great contribution to the home-front effort and joined the Women’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Land Army
        </a>
        and served around Victoria. After the war she toured England for a number of years and became a manager with the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Neill was married in 1951 and had five children: Simon, Peter—who is now deceased, Catherine, Dougal and Michael. From around the time she was married until her untimely death in 1983, Mrs Neill lived in the

        , at various stages, in

        , Sassafras and Olinda. In that time, Mrs Neill’s contribution to the hills area was enormous. Beth was with the

        </a>
        from the late fifties until 1983. She was a feeding coordinator at Cockatoo during the

        bushfires and did a magnificent job. Unfortunately, she suffered a mild stroke after this which led to her passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beth was a trustee of the Sassafras preschool. She was the president of the Sassafras-Ferny Creek primary school mothers club for many years. From 1965 she was a member of the Sassafras-Ferny Creek auxiliary, which assisted the local CFA. Mrs Neill was a Ferny Creek scout group leader, and she made a huge impact on my life through the scouts. With her kind, caring heart, Beth made a huge impact on many young lives.
       </p>

        Accordingly, it is with great pride that I announce to the House that on 10 March 2006 Mrs Neill was awarded the Civilian Service Medal 1939-45. Mrs Neill received the Civilian Service Medal in acknowledgment of her support to Australia’s war effort on the home front during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , by virtue of her great service in the Australian Women’s Land Army. This is also a huge source of pride and satisfaction to her family, particularly to her son Mr Simon Neill who has long sought to have his mother’s important contribution to the war effort recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted that Mrs Neill has been accorded this honour. Mrs Neill’s passing was a great loss to both her family and the community she had so tirelessly served. However, her spirit of civic-mindedness lingers in the hills today, long after her passing. Once again, I congratulate her son Simon for fighting so hard to make sure his mum’s great efforts were recognised with an award.
