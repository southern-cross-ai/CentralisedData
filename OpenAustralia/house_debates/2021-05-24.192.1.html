        race with 14 candidates all campaigning on their own various issues, and the voters recognised the commitment of our party to deliver critical investments across that electorate. There are 11 polling booths that sit inside the Lyne electorate, and I'm very familiar with many of the issues that were raised, including investment in infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and health care and supporting traditional and growing industries that generate jobs in our region.

That starts with keeping the power going in this state, and that's why we at a federal level have made announcements also for power in the Hunter. We must continue to actâ€”
