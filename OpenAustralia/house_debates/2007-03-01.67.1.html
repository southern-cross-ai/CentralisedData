        My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister inform the House how the government is helping low- and middle-income earners in the seat of Wakefield and elsewhere build their retirement savings and secure their future prosperity?

         I thank the honourable member for his question and note the serious support that he provides to the government in securing the future, particularly of young Australians who have low incomes and are supported by this government’s co-contribution scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that every time you come to this dispatch box you look at the view, and it all remains the same right across as you look out—the same old faces, the same old union hacks who have no idea what we are talking about when we talk about support through the co-contribution scheme for small business and low-income people. They are the same puppets run by the unions and of course run by Mr Burke, as we know. When you look out, you think it is no wonder that this is a party which is bad for the Australian economy. It is a party which drives the economy into the ground because it is dictated to by the union movement in this country. That is why the Australian people recognise that the changes this government has made and the support that we provide through the co-contribution scheme to lower income people in particular will set up the next generation in this country for continued economic prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to announce today that this government has provided support to almost 800,000 payments, worth more than $631 million, to Australian workers during the period 1 October last year to 31 December. That is a $1.50 contribution by the Howard government for each $1 put aside into superannuation by low-income workers earning less than $28,000. The message today is for Australians, particularly young Australians or people on low incomes across any age bracket, to think about putting money into superannuation. This government will provide 150 per cent return up front. And when people get that money into their superannuation funds, they should be reminded that the Labor Party opposed this policy at the last election at the behest of the union movement. What that demonstrates is that the Labor Party is still dominated by the union movement and it is bad for the Australian economy.
