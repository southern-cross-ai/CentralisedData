        Congratulations to all of you. You have all made significant contributions to our community in your individual areas of expertise. While I know that you do not seek recognition, I am delighted to be able to provide that in this place.

        I turn now to another major issue in my electorate: the state of Heathcote Road and the decision by the federal government and the federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        to dump coalition plans to commence the feasibility and planning studies for its duplication. Heathcote Road is 24 kilometres in length. It's a major Sydney artery in the south, connecting Western Sydney to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire
        </a>
        and the Illawarra. Thirty-six thousand people travel on this road every day, going to work, taking children to school and moving building materials to construction sites. For the most part it's a single-lane road. People across the electorate continually raise with me Heathcote Road's safety and congestion. Hundreds have signed my online petition. In the lead-up to the 2022 election, I helped secure $17.5 million to commence the planning work for the duplication in its entirety. That funding has now been cancelled by Labor, cancelled by the infrastructure minister, with no rational reason why.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank Chris O'Keefe from radio station 2GB for helping me champion the cause for my local community, many of whom are his listeners. I call upon the Albanese Labor government and federal Infrastructure Minister King to stop playing politics with the lives of those in the shire, Sydney's south and the south-west. Restore funding for the duplication of Heathcote Road.
