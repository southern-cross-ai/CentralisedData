        It was with great pleasure that the Hon. Jenny Aitchison, the state member for Maitland and also the New South Wales Minister for Regional Transport and Roads, announced Evelyn Stonham as the esteemed recipient of the 2024 Maitland Local Woman of the Year. Congratulations, Evelyn.
       </p>
       <p>
        The award was presented at a dinner held on 1 March. Ms Stonham is a fervent advocate for football and a distinguished member of our community. She's been honoured for her exceptional contributions and commitment to the Maitland region on the whole. Her recognition comes amidst a formidable group of nominees, demonstrating the profound impact of her efforts. Among those acknowledged for their fantastic contributions were Jenny Cridland, Stacy Jacobs, Dr Sally Keir and Leanne White, each receiving highly commended honours. Congratulations to you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, the efforts of Judy Hicks, Emily Baitch, Judith Gargosky, Cheryl Lucas, Camilla Callinan, Melissa Chandler, Alanna Vial and Lynn Warner were celebrated, highlighting the depth of talent and commitment in our local community. I want to acknowledge this group of amazing women. Only one person can win the award on the night, but, when you hear about the

        s of this group of people and the impact that they're having across a vast array of projects in our community, you know we are certainly richer for their efforts. Thank you for that.
       </p>

        The accolade that was presented to Ms Stonham during the ceremony was co-hosted by the Women's Network of Hunter New South Wales and the Maitland MP, Jenny Aitchison. I was so pleased to be able to extend my heartfelt congratulations on the evening. Ms Stonham's longstanding dedication to football, spanning over four decades, with affiliations to the Maitland Junior Football Club, the

        federation, has significantly contributed to the sport's growth and inclusivity across the decades. In 2023, the organisation boasted a membership exceeding 1,000 players, which is a testament to Evelyn's leadership and vision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notably, Evelyn has been an advocate for gender equality within the sport, striving for equal participation among male and female members. We also chatted on Friday night about the Matilda's being a huge boost. This year's

        theme focuses on inclusion and aligns perfectly with Evelyn's efforts and achievements. Her role as secretary/registrar has been instrumental in fostering a welcoming and supportive environment within our sporting community, and I am so pleased about that.
