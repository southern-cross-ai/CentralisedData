        Sadly, homelessness is a growing problem in Australia. In the last Census, 24,000 Victorians were listed as being without a home on any given night and 116,000 Australians were listed as being without a home on any given night. They're the ones that we know of. They're the ones who completed the Census or the ones that the Census team were able to catch up with. We know that the figure is much higher and likely to climb. We know that many people may not identify as homeless even though they don't have a permanent home, staying for extended periods with family or moving from friend to friend until they run out of options.
       </p>
       <p>
        New data released at the end of last year identified that in regional Victoria over 5,200 people are homeless. In my own town of Bendigo the data included about 400 people, many of whom are sleeping rough. Every day Victorian homelessness services are turning away 133 people, and that's just one service. Locally I hear from many organisations that they simply can't keep up, and they don't know where people are going if they can't help them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I had the opportunity to catch up with the team at MADCOW, who are based in town in Bendigo. They are trying to fill the gap that has been created. They provide homelessness support services to people who are sleeping rough and people who other services quite often don't know how to help. In January alone they said that they had 15 new clients just walk inâ€”some referrals and some who'd heard that they provide help. What they offer is a cup of tea and a chance to sit down. Their wraparound service tries to link them into other support services. They learn a little bit about their story but don't make them feel questioned. They don't make them feel judged. They give them the opportunity to find a friend. I really want to acknowledge the many volunteers and the amazing leadership of Matt and Fiona, who have really helped to pull this service together and see it grow. They told me that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic demand soared and it continued to grow.

        Tent cities are popping up all over the country; you just have to look. Whether it's in Huntly, the Whipstick forests or even next to the railway lines, you can't get past the fact that we have growing tent cities. They're popping up everywhere. The one next to the railway yard even has its own mayor. All the people turn to him and seek leadership and guidance. He's been there the longest. He's the one that the police go to. He's the one that the services go to if somebody is missing or they're not quite sure.
       </p>
       <p>
        A client suggested the name MADCOW because they kind of take on everybody. They are partly funded and supported by the Baptist church, but they are so much more. They ensure that people not only get a good meal and a warm cuppa but are able to take a shower if they like, wash their clothes and connect to a range of services and agencies across Bendigo, who are quite frankly under siege.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their current building is not fit for purpose, but they haven't just sat back and waited. They've actually gone out there and secured the funding not only from donations from the church community but also through securing a grant from the

        foundation. They've pulled together funding to buy their building. Their next plan is to gut the place and build a fit-for-purpose space that can be a homelessness hub for the rough sleepers in Bendigo. They know that there's an increase in demand, and they believe that this service could really help people get back on track. I agree.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not just for the people who are seeking support that this space would help. It would also help their many volunteers to have a fit-for-purpose place. A lot of the people who offer clinical services go to this building already because that's where the homeless people are. It's where they may start their drug and alcohol rehab. It's where they may see a

        . It's where they may access many clinical services. It is a good starting point. It is a project that governments should look to support. What I really respect about the team at MADCOW is that they are just getting on with it, but would welcome a partner in helping them do it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the volunteers of not just MADCOW but every organisation in Greater Bendigo and across the Bendigo electorate who tonight are ensuring that rough sleepers have a good meal and have somewhere to go tomorrow not just for a meal but to wash their clothes and to have a friendly chat.
