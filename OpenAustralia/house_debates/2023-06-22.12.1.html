       <p>
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I present the
        <i>
         Final report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I rise as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to briefly speak to the committee's final report. On 1 July 2023, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, known as ACLEI, will become part of the new National Anti-Corruption Commission, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACC" rel="nofollow">
         NACC
        </a>
        . Accordingly, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity will cease to exist, with the oversight of the NACC undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission. With this change imminent, the committee resolved to present this final report outlining its work since it was first established.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee was established by the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, which commenced operation on 30 December 2006. Resolutions relating to the powers and proceedings of the committee were first agreed in the 41st Parliament in February 2007. The committee was created to oversee the operation of ACLEI to ensure the Integrity Commissioner is accountable to parliament. The committee tabled 23 reports—and this report makes it 24—over 16 years. This final report details the work of the committee from its establishment to date and explains the transition to the NACC.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank my colleagues on the current committee. Although I have been chair only a short time, I appreciate the collegiate way in which this committee operates. I also thank former chairs, deputy chairs and members of the committee over the past 16 years. In addition, I wish to thank the Integrity Commissioner and ACLEI officials for their proactive and professional engagement of over the life of the committee. I thank the current integrity commissioner, Mrs Jaala Hinchcliffe, for her active and helpful engagement with the committee. Of course, none of this is possible without a secretariat, and I'd like to put on the record the thanks of committee members over the many years to the secretariat, including current committee secretary Lyn Beverly and her team. I trust that the information in this final report will usefully mark the work of this committee over the 16 years of its existence.
