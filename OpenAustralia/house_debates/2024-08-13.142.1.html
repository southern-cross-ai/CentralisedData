        A few months ago I attended the Alfred Cove Art Society exhibition in my electorate of Tangney. The exhibition was part of the Melville Open Studios event, where local artists open their studios and spaces to the public. As I walked through the exhibition, it was so inspiring to see the work of some of the many artists in Tangney—landscapes that capture the beauty of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , portraits that express people's heart and soul, and still-life paintings with such beautiful details. One watercolour caught my eye: three koi fish swimming in the bluest of waters. Titled

        , the painting was bright and joyous but also had a sense of calm. It brought a smile to my face. I purchased the painting and it's now hanging proudly in my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I went to collect the painting I met the artist, Monique Taylor. Monique shared with me her love of watercolours and some of the children's books she has written and illustrated. I particularly liked her book about two robots who are learning to write in English. It brought back memories of when I was studying English at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and learnt about parts of speech. Art helps us connect and communicate in ways that sometimes words cannot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I also attended the opening of Chang Yoong Chia's exhibition, titled
        <i>
         Stories of Journeys from Malaysia to Australia
        </i>
        , at the Wireless Hill Museum in Tangney. Yoong Chia is an artist from Malaysia, and for his exhibition he listened to the stories of Malaysian migrants to Australia. Yoong Chia's work brought back memories of my own migration. It made me reflect on the different but similar journeys that I share with some of the many migrant families in Tangney—how we set down roots, how we work hard to give our children better opportunities and how we join our tradition of char kway teow with the new custom of flat whites.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of the paintings brought tears to my eyes. In one, there were the words of a young child:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Before coming here, Dad worked non-stop and only rest during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Coming here we got to go on holiday. I got to know him better.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yoong Chia painted a child and father relaxing in a field, their car parked nearby. Looking at the painting was like looking in the mirror. When my family and I moved to Australian in 2002, I finally had the time to spend with my family. We drove to the Pinnacles and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Mia" rel="nofollow">
         Monkey Mia
        </a>
        , and we spent a week together, talking, eating and laughing. To me, Yoong Chia's painting reflects the values of family. A second painting described the journey of migration. After living overseas, we migrants return home to the cemetery to see our parents. This painting was also about me. I lost my mum during COVID. I had not seen her for three years, and the next time I went to see her, I went to a cemetery. My heart was heavy as I looked into this painting with a sadness that is unspeakable. At the same time, I felt a common bond that many of us migrants share, and this gave me comfort.

        The Albanese Labor government is making a strong investment in Australia's art, entertainment and culture sectors. We are investing in supporting our live music scene, promoting Australian stories and supporting our brilliant arts training organisations. These investments include $115.2 million for Australia's eight national arts training organisations. We need to ensure that we are nurturing the next generation of creative talent. A $14.5 million investment is being made to support the production of Australian children's screen content. Just as I saw myself reflected in Yoong Chia's paintings, it is important for Australian children to see themselves reflected in the stories they watch or experience. A $9.3 million investment will help the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_and_Sound_Archive" rel="nofollow">
         National Film and Sound Archive

        expand and enhance its capacity to store highly flammable nitrate based cultural heritage material belonging to our national collecting institutions. We are investing in live music, with $8.6 million for the Revive Live program to provide essential support for live music venues and festivals showcasing Australian bands and artists and $5.2 million to expand and develop the Canberra and Darwin symphony orchestras.
       </p>
       <p>
        These investments build on progress the Albanese Labor government has already made. It is important for us to continue to tell Australian stories and to support the Australian artists who tell these stories in such inspiring and powerful ways, whether they be stories of migrants or a beautiful mosaic that shows the incredible culture and diversity of Tangney. An upcoming concert in Tangney by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Attadale will showcase music from some of our favourite films and operas. I've met many writers in Tangney. They have important stories to tell, inspired by their own stories and journeys, by the beauty of Western Australia or, sometimes, by the common feelings we have that make all of us human.
       </p>

        I recently attended an exhibition of paintings and ceramics at Atwell House in Tangney. The exhibition
        <i>
         Earth, Fire and Water
        </i>
        showed works by members of the Alfred Cove Art Society and the South of the River Potters Club. These two great local arts groups collaborated for a powerful exhibition. I enjoyed seeing how each artist interpreted the theme: abstract landscapes or boats out on the water. Familiar places and objects were captured in a new way. I had a chance to meet many of the artists in Tangney. They are people from all backgrounds and all experiences. At the exhibition I saw how the artists and their works all came together.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not only the works of art that touch people. The artists themselves also leave a deep impression, with different stories and perspectives coming together in one place. I saw fellowship and community, and asked the artists about their work and the process and thinking that goes into each piece of art. I also saw reflection as the artists shared their stories and supported each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud that there are so many talented artists in Tangney and proud that we have many arts organisations who do everything from organising exhibitions to providing classes for artists, both young and old, in all stages of their careers. The arts provide opportunities for the Tangney community to not just come together and celebrate but also learn from one another. And, when we learn from each other and from each other's experience, we can better understand each other. I believe our Tangney artists are an important part of our community. We need to continue to support the arts and our artists. Thank you, all, for all your powerful work.
