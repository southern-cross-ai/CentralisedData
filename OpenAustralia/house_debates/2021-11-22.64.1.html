        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister please update the House on how the Morrison government is working to secure our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and provide more opportunities for Australian businesses and Australian families?

         I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. Whether in Wentworth or anywhere else in the country, Australians are looking forward. They are looking forward to Christmas. They are looking forward to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's" rel="nofollow">
          New Year's
         </a>
         . They are looking forward to coming together all around this country. And they are able to do that by the great achievements they have achieved over these last few years. Australians are looking forward to next year, and they have the confidence to look forward because of what they have been able to achieve together, in particular under the policies we have been able to put in place to support them through one of the biggest challenges this country has faced since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         As a result of that, we have one of the lowest fatality rates from COVID in the world. We have one of the strongest, particularly advanced economies coming through this pandemic in the world. We also have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. Australians have been keeping their side of the deal, and I am determined to make sure governments, including my own, keep our part of the deal as well. The national plan is about securing Australia's economic recovery. We cannot take Australia's economic recovery for granted. The national plan provides that way forward. It means that we can open safely so we can stay safely open. It means governments stepping back so Australians can step forward. Australians have had to sacrifice much, and they have earned being able to regain the many liberties that they had to forfeit over these past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next step forward in that plan we've announced today with the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         . Skilled migrants and students will be coming back to Australia on 1 December, and they will be joined by all visitors from the Republic of Korea and Japan, joining those visitors from Singapore. That's further evidence that our government is keeping our side of the deal. Australians are keeping their side of the deal by getting vaccinated at record rates, with 85 per cent double-dose vaccinations around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our economic recovery plan is also securing that recovery with lower taxes and affordable and reliable energy, supporting our manufacturing and resources industries and ensuring that we're building the economic infrastructure that Australians need, particularly where I was last week, at Western Sydney International (

         ) Airportâ€”a project that went nowhere under Labor but has been a reality under the Liberal-National government. Under six years of Labor, they talked a lot, and they did absolutely nothing. We're boosting apprentices. We have a record number of apprentices now in trade training.
