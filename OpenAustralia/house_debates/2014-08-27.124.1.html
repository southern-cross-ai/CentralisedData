        The people of Townsville know full well my opinion of the Brothers football clubs. '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fish" rel="nofollow">
         The Fish
        </a>
        ', as they are called, have 97 players on the sidelines as reserve for third grade. They think God is on their side. They win everything. They are well coached. They are good blokes and good sports. They have great social functions. Of course, I hate them!
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to speak about Brothers rugby union tonight, and one person in particular: Frank Fanning. Frank is the youngest of eight children. His family consists of Paul, John, Mary, Joan, Michael, Terry, Brian and, of course, the youngestâ€”Frank. Their mum is a beautiful lady by the name of Maureen. I never met his dad, Ian, as he passed some years ago. Frank was born with Down syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Frank's brothers played for, coached and officiated at Brothers. Frank made his debut for Brothers Rugby Union Club as water boy some 23 seasons ago in 1992. He turned 40 this year. He now runs the water for as many grades as he can, sometimes as many as six games in a day, or until he goes to mass with his mum. During his career, it is estimated that he has taken the water on to something like 1,500 injured or tired players. On the odd occasion where he has filled in on the wing, at every break he has called for the water and critiqued the performance of the person bringing the water onto the field. He is an institution at Brothers rugby union. He will attend the final training session every season before the grand final and his pre-match speech is, apparently, absolutely something to behold.
       </p>
       <p>
        He now carries the title of 'Senior Water Man' and is listed in that position on the club's website alongside the president, secretary and treasurer. He demands and gets a new set of water bottles every year. He also threatens to retire every year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, at Brothers' Blue and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ball" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Fran was made a life member. I am a life member of my old football club. I know many life members of lots of organisations. Few, if any, have had Frank's constant and unwavering support of his club and its players. He is incessant calls of, 'Brothers! Brothers!' every time he feels his team is in trouble is synonymous with rugby at Hughes Street.
       </p>
       <p>
        Frank now has a nephew, Ben, who also has Down syndrome. His version of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Jackson
        </a>
        song
        <i>
         Ben
        </i>
        has to be heard to be believed. But Ben will grow up knowing that he has an absolute tribe in his corner. Not just Frank or his aunts and uncles, not just his cousins and not just the Brothers rugby fraternity; Ben will be entering the entire sporting lexicon of Townsville, knowing that there is a place for absolutely anyone who wants to put in.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a mate of mine, Col Kenna, said last week at the announcement of Frank's life membership, 'Frank's presence in the rugby community provides an excellent example for all the young people and any new players who arrive at our club. Frank's presence and involvement in Brothers Rugby Union Club Townsville allows players to witness and be involved in the important areas of acceptance and inclusion of all members of the community and in valuing the contribution of all people in that community.' As I said, Frank did not get a life membership as a gift. He earned it with hard work and dedication to the club and he is a major part of that club's success, both on and off the field. Brothers rugby club do not just keep people around as a charity. They only let people in who contribute. Their acknowledgement of Frank's contribution is not a birthday present because he has Down syndrome. It is because he is the very essence of a club man: a Brothers man.
       </p>
       <p>
        As much as I hate the 'Fish', I love everything about the club and its people. This is a great moment in sport. Congratulations to Frank Fanning, a Brothers boy through and through.
