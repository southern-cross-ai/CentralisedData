        Today I rise to talk about a group called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Cross
        </a>
        Kids Camps. As I have stated in this chamber on a number of occasions, being a member of parliament enables us to meet extraordinary people and organisations that make a difference in our community. One such organisation is Southern Cross Kids Camps, which is headed by Dave Marrett, a former director of the successful and innovative programs of the Berwick Church of Christ. In his new role Dave runs programs to look after children who have been neglected, abused and subjected to domestic violence. These camps are run across Australia as well as in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , and I am fortunate to have one in my region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The children, who range in age from eight to 11 years, are referred to participate in these camps by social workers, foster care agencies and school principals and chaplains. The camps provide the opportunity for some children to experience for the first time a nurturing, activity filled camp with caring, supportive professionals and volunteers. In particular, they have their very own buddy, a screened and trained adult who is with them for the week of the camp. These buddies participate in the activities, the sports and the evening programs. They become part of the supporting environment which plays a large part in the process of renewal of trust in interactions with adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        When kids arrive at the Southern Cross Kids Camps the trait that they all share is the need for help. They are either withdrawn or challenging but they are always longing for acceptance. In the words of Carolyn Boyd, who founded Southern Cross:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They feel guilt for crimes they have not committed … shame for the secrets that have been revealed, responsible for family break-ups and bewilderment at the shattering of their world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In these shattered worlds Southern Cross Kids Camps become a haven, an outlet for these kids and a mechanism through which they can at least begin to be themselves. In many cases these important camps can become turning points in young people’s lives. Interestingly, some prominent Australians have themselves been through these camps as children and have transformed their lives. In 2009—the ninth year that Southern Cross has been operating—240 children participated in these camps. This was made possible by the work of over 400 volunteers, which is testament to just how well-regarded this organisation is amongst local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the short amount of time I now have available, I wish to mention one particular experience that Dave recounted to me earlier this month as a consequence of one of the camps. As I said, there is an issue with children and trust. At the start of the year they organised birthday boxes to hand out to kids participating in their programs. As you would expect, the kids receiving these presents were absolutely thrilled, except for one young boy who sat quietly in the corner staring at his gift without opening it. When Dave realised he was not going to open it, he went over to the boy and said, ‘Why aren’t you?’ The boy said, ‘I don’t want to open it because it will be empty, anyway.’ Dave spent time reassuring him. The boy opened it and realised there was something in there. This camp is a key transformational point in children’s lives and I think all parliamentarians in this House should support this program.
