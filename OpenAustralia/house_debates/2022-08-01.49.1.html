        I was stuck here over the weekend. Canberra is a beautiful place, but I did miss my electorate. There was a lot on. I have given my apologies to the groups and individuals, but I want to note them here in the House. Firstly, Arts Deloraine had their midwinter festival, called WinterFire, with arts, music and produce in the beautiful

        . There was just so much on and I was sorry I couldn't be there. They had bonfires and a traditional smoking ceremony as well.

        Landcare Tasmania had a big planting day down at Bridgewater in the south of my electorate. That was yesterday. Hundreds of people would have turned out to plant trees. So well done to all involved in that. There was also, on the weekend, on 31 July,

        for Oscar Cripps, a four-year-old boy who is suffering from lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was a walk for him as he suffers through that. It was a fundraiser up in Deloraine, a wonderful initiative organised by family daycare educators Tammy Hilder and Susanna Haberle. They invited me to participate. Of course, I donated. I am very sorry I couldn't be there for that as well.

        There was Old Mates Day in the south.

        —what a legend!—has been getting farmers together because of the saleyard closure. Hundreds of people would have turned out for that. It's always a fantastic occasion. Last but not least, Opening the Gate starts this week. There's a boom in agritourism in Tasmania—
