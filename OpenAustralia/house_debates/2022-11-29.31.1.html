        I rise to congratulate local Hunter resident William Crighton on winning an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA" rel="nofollow">

        award. On Tuesday night William took out the ARIA for the best blues and roots album for his third record

         and
        </i>

        </i>
        . This was his first nomination. He was blown away when his name was read out. William is an outstanding performer who literally is taking Australian music to a new level. It has been a big couple of years for this talented musician, who spent much of the year touring with

        William is an incredibly talented musician in his own right, but he credits his success to the most important person in his lifeâ€”his wife, Julieanne, who was also an accomplished musician. Not content with writing and performing, William and his wife, Julieanne, also run the music program at the

        . Congratulations on this award, buddy. It's well-deserved for all the hard work you've put in over the last couple of decades. I hope you get a bit of rest, a few tins and start the renovation on your house.

        I would like to respond to the member from Illawarra earlier talking about being the burger king. I congratulate the burger restaurant there, but they have to come up to the Hunter and see what the Hunter is about with the burgers in the area.
