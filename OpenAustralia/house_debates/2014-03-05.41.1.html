        I rise to speak about my visit last Friday to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batemans_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Batemans Bay
        </a>
        , which is in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. I had great pleasure in undertaking a walk through the main shopping centre, popping in to talk to the small businesses operating there. I have a message for the Leader of the Opposition: not one business owner asked me to fight to retain the carbon tax. Quite the oppositeâ€”they want costs on businesses to be eased and they recognise the flow-through impact of the removal of the tax. They see that it would boost family disposable income by reducing electricity prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        While at the shopping centre, I took the opportunity to mention our upcoming small business forum with the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        , the member for Dunkley. That will be held in Batemans Bay on Monday, 28 April at 5:30 pm. It is important that our local businesses have direct access to the small business minister and it is a great opportunity to let the cabinet minister know about local issues and concerns. We will be advertising that forum soon.
       </p>

        Shortly after this walk-through I took part in an outside broadcast with Radio 2EC at Bridge Plaza for DonateLife. I recognise the tremendous efforts by Brad and Lorae Rossiter and the success of their endeavours in the region. DonateLife raises awareness in the community of the importance of organ donation. Volunteers and community workers like the Rossiters are the lifeblood of rural and regional towns and I thank them for their service to the community.
