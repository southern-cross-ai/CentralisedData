        I would like to brief the House on what was an extraordinary opportunity to observe another nation's exercise in democracy, and that was the elections in Fiji last December. Due to the recalling of parliament, I stepped into the role of co-chair in the multinational observer group, affectionately known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOG" rel="nofollow">
         MOG
        </a>
        , in Fiji. I was honoured to co-chair the MOG for Fiji's 2022 election, alongside our friends from Indonesia and India. This is the third time Australia, India and Indonesia have been asked by the government of Fiji to co-chair an observer mission for the general elections as trusted friends of Fiji. The MOG's previous reports from 2014 contributed to Fiji's strengthening democratic processes, and the final report for the 2022 election will be delivered shortly. I'd like to extend my thanks to the previous co-chair, the member for Fremantle, as well as other observers: the member for Banks, Senator Chandler and former senator

        . I would also like to extend my thanks to the foreign minister, my fellow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Senator Penny Wong, for this opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 14 December last year, just as Australians were gearing up for their summer breaks, Fiji was going to the polls. From Nadi to Savusavu, from the Yasawas to Taveuni, and in many other places that many Australians have never been to, Fiji voted in a proud and peaceful manner, and I was so impressed with the sense of calm and the strong desire of individuals to have their voices heard, often queuing for a long time in the rain, the heat or the wind. The support given to the elderly and disabled was extraordinary, even having braille ballot sheets. Fijians voted in an election which was professionally run and managed in a manner which the MOG felt allowed the Fijian people to express their voices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, the observers felt the outcome of the election broadly reflected the will of the Fijian people. This election saw the most Fijians registered to vote, and there were more political parties and candidates, reflecting that Fijians are engaging actively with their democratic system. I also saw a historic peaceful and orderly transition of power through an election, showing that democracy is alive and strong in this important Pacific nation. As the co-chairs announced immediately after the election, the observer group did not observe any irregularities or issues during the prepolling, postal or election date voting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the election-observing process, members of the MOG attended all aspects of the electoral process and attended nearly a third of polling stations. There were nearly 100 members of the MOG, coming from 16 countries from right across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands Forum
        </a>
        and the secretariat of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesian_Spearhead_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Melanesian Spearhead Group
        </a>
        . Representatives came from across the Pacific, as well as Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, Indonesia and India. The region's engagement demonstrates our collecting valuing of democratic processes and good governance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to pass on my thanks to the secretariat of the MOG, including Paul Wojciechowski, who was ably supported by Australian officials Andrew Edgar, Peter Lothian, Kirsten Storey, Nish Perera and Xander Burns and by Luke Kingi from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , as well as two international electoral experts: Carlos Valenzuela and Mariela Lopez. The operations team, headed by consultant Gary Frost, did an amazing job in ensuring members of the MOG were able to travel to every corner of Fiji safely. To the Australian consulate and to the acting high commissioner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and his whole team, including Melissa Tipping and Joanna Houghton: a big thank you. And a big vinaka vakalevu—which is 'thank you' in Fijian—to all the Fijian liaison officers who guided our observers across Fiji. I'd also like to thank my co-chairs, Mr Sharma, representing India, and His Excellency Ambassador Syihab, representing Indonesia. Congratulations to everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to thank the people of Fiji for their hospitality and for showing their faith in the democratic processes and values: vinaka
