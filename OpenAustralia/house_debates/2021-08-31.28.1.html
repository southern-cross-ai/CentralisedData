       <p>
        This week is Men's Shed Week. Sheds across the country are celebrating the fundamentals of that movement: connection, community and camaraderie. They play such an important role in providing men with a place to connect, a community to belong to and mates who make it all worthwhile.
       </p>
       <p>
        A lot of men, particularly those from older generations, find it difficult to talk about feelings and emotions and, quite frankly, don't take an interest in their own health and wellbeing as much as they perhaps should. Because of this, on average, many men are less healthy than womenâ€”they drink more, take more risks and suffer from isolation, loneliness and depression. Getting together and just having a yarn is priceless and never more have we valued this simple act so much than in this time with millions of Australians suffering through lockdowns. It's given us all an appreciation of the importance of social connection and, perhaps, a greater appreciation for what the men's shed movement has to offer.

        and in Canberra for five weeks, I have really missed my regular catch-ups with members of the 25 men's sheds across Barker. Whilst I won't be able to see it for myself, I know that the men of these sheds are celebrating with gusto right across Barker this week. I know that because what each shed brings to its members and wider communities is worth celebrating.
