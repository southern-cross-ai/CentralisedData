        is perhaps best known for the fantastic lifestyle it offers its residents. My seat of Swan, in Perth, is a great example of this lifestyle. On a typical summer evening along the South Perth foreshore, there will be people walking, running, cycling, kicking a football or soccer ball or playing cricket, and families and friends enjoying an evening barbecue as the sun goes down and watching the magical transition of the city of Perth from day to night. Over the next two weeks, there will be even more ways to enjoy the fabulous lifestyle in Swan, thanks to the

        Fiesta 2009 event. Fiesta 2009 is a cultural event driven by a range of community interests and organised by the City of South Perth. The staff at the City of South Perth should be congratulated on their efforts, and we must not forget all the volunteers who make these events run smoothly with the minimum of fuss.

        I have spoken in the House before about the successes achieved within this community. Living locally and having been involved in many community groups, I have often seen these types of successes evolve, and this fiesta is one of them. This event has brought together many sporting associations, such as the Manning Tennis Club; more sedentary pursuits, such as the South Perth Bridge Club; charitable organisations, such as the Esther Foundation and Southcare; environmental organisations, such as the

        ; and educational institutions, such as

        and

        â€”and the list goes on. Many of the events are outdoors, which suits our WA lifestyle. I attended the opening concert on Saturday night, where

        performed. I encourage all local residents to take part in this cultural event. We may not have the big Adelaide fringe style festivals in Perth, but we do have fantastic small-scale local ones.
