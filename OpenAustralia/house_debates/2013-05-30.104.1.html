       <p>
        I bring to the attention of the House the wonderful developments and challenges in northern Tasmania as a result of direct investment in this region by the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, I mention education spending and the investment into almost every primary school and high school in Bass of over $70 million since November 2010 in spending on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        . Schools which had not had as much as a lick of paint for years were transformed into first-class facilities with the construction of libraries, computer and science labs, classrooms, gymnasiums and performing arts centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor is also determined to ensure our economy stays strong by investing in a skilled workforce that businesses in northern Tasmania need to stay competitive and to create local jobs. For example, this government has invested in vocational education with four trade training centres in my electorate. This includes investment of $3.5 million for the two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        training centres, $3.4 million for the Dorset trade training centre, and $986,000 for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick's_College" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Patrick's College
        </a>
        trade training centre in Launceston. Students at the Tasmanian Polytechnic in Launceston enjoy a fantastic tourism and hospitality training facility thanks to an investment of $5.8 million from the Teaching and Learning Capital Fund. The Teaching and Learning Capital Fund also invested in the Green Skills Centre of Excellence at the skills institute's Alanvale campus. This facility provides training for a combination of construction, furniture making and allied trades and is the base for training apprentices and upgrading the knowledge and skills of experienced tradespeople.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor is committed not only to creating a skilled workforce but also to creating jobs in northern Tasmania. I recently announced that $50,000 from the government's flexible funding pool would be provided for an employment allies project in Launceston to assist newly-arrived migrants and humanitarian entrants to overcome barriers to employment and to enter the local workforce. This month I attended the Australian government's job and skills expo in Launceston, where over 300 jobs and training opportunities were on offer to local job seekers by a variety of businesses and training organizations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also extremely proud of the fact that Labor has invested more money than ever before into Tasmanian health. The Gillard government's Primary Care Infrastructure Grants, for example, have significantly expanded the services that local doctors offer to the northern Tasmanian community. Patients have been provided with greater access to new health professionals such as more
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, diabetes educators, mental health workers and physiotherapists through this investment of over $2 million in several of the GP practices in Bass. The Labor government has invested $4.7 million to refurbish the John L. Grove Centre in Launceston, making it northern Tasmania's only public rehabilitation facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, an investment of $325 million into Tasmania's health system directly benefited northern Tasmania with initiatives such as increased elective surgery, better palliative care, a walk-in centre for minor illnesses and injuries in Launceston, and the sharing of an innovative new health sciences precinct. Just this week I announced the federal government investment of $4 million for the redevelopment of the Northern Dental Centre to deliver improved dental services for patients and dental training in northern Tasmania. I was also pleased to be able to announce last year that the Labor government had invested $6.8 million in the St Giles Society's northern paediatric allied health and disability service for redevelopment and the implementation of their e-health infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal Labor government has also offered unprecedented support for farmers in Tasmania to encourage a $400 million investment in irrigation schemes and the Sense-T project, which provide jobs for Tasmanians, give farmers the confidence to invest and will have significant economic benefits for our rural communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor is also investing in Australia's future and ensuring that communities are not left behind with the rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . This is in stark contrast to the Liberal's 'fraudbrand' plan, which will see a significantly slower 'copper-to-home' internet connection, costing families and small businesses up to $5,000 to connect.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        in Tasmania is on track and will be delivered in all of the north-east of the state by 2014 and to 2,600 homes in Launceston. I could go on about the Scottsdale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">

        's $18 million, and many other investments. Labor's record of investment is an impressive one and it is designed to meet the future economic challenges of northern Tasmania.
