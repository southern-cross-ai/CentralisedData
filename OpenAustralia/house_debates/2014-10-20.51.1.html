        I rise to congratulate the ABC for its Mental As campaignâ€”an excellently coordinated awareness campaign. Well done. Mental health is a key issue in Australia, with almost half the population experiencing a mental health disorder at some time during their lifetime. Our national broadcaster launched its biggest cross-platform programming event on Monday, 6 October to raise awareness and funds for mental illness and by Saturday morning had raised over $1 million for mental health research and, much more importantly, raised our national awareness of mental illness.

        At least one-third of young people in Australia have had an episode of mental illness by the age of 25, with depression and anxiety disorders the most prevalent. I was struck by the story of Tim Watt from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Gambier
        </a>
        that was broadcast during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Week as part of the Mental As campaign. His story is emblematic of so many men in regional communities. Tim described the expectations that he would carry on as an invincible man and perpetuate the myth that farmers do not need to talk about pain and loss. This is despite the fact that his brother had committed suicide at age 20, an incident that Tim did not dare speak of for 23 years. Whilst his statement, 'In agriculture we are meant to be bulletproof, we are meant to be as tough as nails,' rings true for many, it is just as true that everyone needs to speak from time to time and it is good for men to talk about the issues they face.
