       <p>
        I rise to speak on the impact of Labor's changes to 60-day dispensing. It's important that this government take every step it can to help Australians suffering through the current cost-of-living crisis, particularly those who are most vulnerable to economic hardship. However, it is the consequences of this policy, rather than the intentions, that matter. The direct impact of this policy will be to reduce the viability of small regional local pharmacies, in some cases to the point of closure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having spoken at length to several pharmacists in my electorate, my greatest concern is for residents of small communities like Goombungee, Kingsthorpe, Cambooya and Westbrook. The small local pharmacies in these towns simply are not large enough to sustain significant changes to their business model. Nathan Jarvis, the owner of the Oakey Pharmacy, told me that the impact of this change would be a direct bottom-line cost of $283,000. Not only would this change impact the service he is able to provide to his community, including free deliveries and cheap provision of Webster-paks, it reduces his ability to support the local sports clubs and community organisations in the town of Oakey. This family run business plays a crucial role in its community, and the impacts of this decision will be broadly felt.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't doubt the government's intention here, but, given the complete lack of consultation with regional pharmacists prior to announcing this policy, I do doubt that the government has fully understood the consequences of its actions. Small country towns are doing it tough right now, and this government must not make a bad situation worse by rushing through this ill-considered policy. I implore the minister to go out and listen to those regional pharmacists and understand the consequences of this policy.
