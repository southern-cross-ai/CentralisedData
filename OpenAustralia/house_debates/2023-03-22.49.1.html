        I rise to congratulate local Hunter resident
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
         Bradley Robinson
        </a>
        who was recently honoured as a finalist in the 2022 Community Education Student of the Year Awards, an award presented by Community Colleges Australia. This award celebrates student achievement in all its forms, including communication, team and leadership skills as well as development and student involvement in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bradley was selected as a finalist for the award as recognition of his leadership qualities and strong appetite for learning. Like me, Bradley decided he wanted to do an apprenticeship in high school. He studies a Certificate III in Engineering or, as tradies call it, 'He's a boilie'. He did this trade at Central Coast Community College, where teachers recognised his natural talent and nurtured it. His trade has taught him invaluable skills, such as boilermaking, consultation, design, testing and installation.
       </p>
       <p>
        An apprenticeship can take you anywhere in life. I stand here, in this House, as an example of that. In the Hunter, there are opportunities for all students, no matter if you dream to work at a desk or if you dream to become a tradie. Congratulations to you, once again, Bradley, on your award. You've chosen an excellent trade. Good luck, and thank you to all the teachers, at all levels of our education system, across the Hunter for all your hard work.
