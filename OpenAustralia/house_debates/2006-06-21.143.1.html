       <p>
        Today I would like to talk about Blueprint Shoalhaven, a project in the Gilmore electorate which is jointly funded by local, state and federal government. The background of Blueprint Shoalhaven came about for two reasons. Firstly, the Shoalhaven Economic Development Strategy, released in mid-2005, sought to have the various industry sectors within the Shoalhaven examined to determine capability and future growth potential. At the same time, an air of uncertainty had arisen as a result of closures announced for mid-2006 in some prominent industries in the city. A program to examine key wealth generating sectors within the Shoalhaven economy was suggested and pursued with vigour by all levels of government in the shape of Blueprint Shoalhaven.
       </p>
       <p>
        The process evolved like this. A team of committed industry leaders undertook to take up the challenge and examine ways to move the economy forward. The Blueprint Shoalhaven team invited business and community to prepare for the blueprint. A series of industry-specific summits were conducted to engage individuals and ideas. These successful forums were conducted over a period of some six months with specific action items developed through the process. At the final Blueprint Shoalhaven summit this Monday, an action plan will be released to move the community, business and government forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the way ahead, the challenge is now to continue the process. The action items embraced all sectors of the community—not just government. Collaboration is the key to success in delivering economic benefit to the Shoalhaven. Many examples of success through joint ventures, cooperation and innovative approaches were identified through the Blueprint Shoalhaven process. There are many out there waiting to be nurtured. The support that was given would not have been possible without the commitment of the many close to the process who gave their ideas at each Blueprint mini-summit. The tourism summit was headed by Linda Marquis, the health and ageing public sector summit by

        , the industry summit by Lynell Johnson and the defence summit by Murray Mortimer. Each industry summit had something like 100 to 150 people participating. They were run by the local people for the local community. Monday will be the culmination of six months work by a large group of people representing a broad cross-section of our community who came together determined to establish an action plan that will help guide the economic development of the Shoalhaven. The action plan presented on Monday will deliver what it set out to achieve. The plan includes realistic short- and long-term achievable outcomes. As I said earlier, the Blueprint Shoalhaven was run by local people for the local community.
