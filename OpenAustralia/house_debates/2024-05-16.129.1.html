       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. I wish to seek clarification on the rules regarding fundraisers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . In October 2022, the Prime Minister wrote to you and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        and he then requested that political fundraisers in bookable spaces in the building be banned. At that time, both you and the President of the Senate agreed to that ban. There are reports this week that some members have charged between $1,000 and $2,000 a ticket for budget reply fundraising events within Parliament House despite that rule change. These reports are concerning. In 2022, the Prime Minister said that he was seeking this change because the dignity of Parliament House should be maintained. In my opinion, members hosting fundraisers within the Parliament House offices wilfully disregards your 2022 ruling and it does compromise the dignity of this House. Could you please clarify for members: what are the rules regarding fundraisers within Parliament House?

        <p>
         I had anticipated that this question would come forward as a result of media coverage. But I want to remind all members that the member is correctâ€”on 17 October, the president and I did change the policy for bookable areas in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . When parliamentarians have made bookings for events, they now must declare that the event is not for the purpose of political fundraising and complies with this policy. Political fundraising cannot take place in the bookable areas of Parliament House. I made these policy changes for practical implementation so that political fundraising could not occur. I want to advise all individual members and request that they respect this policy. It's my personal view that political fundraising does not occur in this place. The dignity of the parliament must always be maintained in line with the Australian public's expectation.
