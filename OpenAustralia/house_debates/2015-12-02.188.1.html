        One hundred years ago, it was reported that on Monday morning 30 November 1915 the Nowra showground was a hive of activity as recruits, organisers and supporters feverishly prepared for the departure of the Waratah Recruiting March. Leaving the showground shortly before 9.20, the contingent marched the short distance down the Junction Street slope to the Nowra Post Office on the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Berry Street
        </a>
        . With most of the shops closed so that everyone could attend, there was huge crowd gathered from all parts of the district, with estimates ranging from 2,000 to 4,000. The Waratah Recruiting March, which travelled from Nowra to Sydney just prior to Christmas in 1915 was one of a number organised around the state following the success of the Coo-ee March.

        On Sunday morning 29 November 2015, the local Nowra community re-enacted this significant event of patriotism that took place so long ago. Two years ago, the Anzac commemorative grants committee met to discuss the various submissions that had been put forward. Most were to upgrade memorials or for special events surrounding Anzac Day itself. These two projects were quite different. Since then these projects have been developed. The first was to enable the publication of a commemorative book,

        . Other members of the historical society, Robyn Florance and Timothy Rigney were the driving force for this outstanding project and they also worked tirelessly on the background research for the waratah recruiting re-enactment.

       <p>
        The second major project was coordinated, organised and created by two tenacious and dedicated local veterans, Clyde Poulton and Rick Meehan. They were the catalysts involving many

        members and community groups and gathering the public for the journey down memory lane. They also organised a steam train for the day from the

       <p>
        It is not easy to have roads closed, marching people and steam trains all working together, but they pulled it off and it was magic.
