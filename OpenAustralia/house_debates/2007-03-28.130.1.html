       <p>
        This week we are once again running the very successful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        parliamentary program, where members of the tri-service join members and senators to learn about our side of the business. I would particularly like to welcome Commander Michael Rothwell, who is with us this morning. Commander Rothwell is currently with Fleet Headquarters but was the captain of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS

        <i>
         Tobruk

        . Thank you for the service that you give to our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        That brings me to the point that I wanted to speak about: Defence Force Reserves. I am a very big supporter of Defence Force Reserves. Commander Rothwell will know that these days when ships go to sea 30 per cent of the crew is often made up of reservists who go and support our operations. This morning I have been flying with 28 Squadron, another Reserve squadron. I thank Air Commodore Peter McDermott, Squadron Leader Shaun Jenkins, who was the pilot, Squadron Leader Simon Pattel, who assisted with the arrangements, and of course the crew of the aircraft.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aircraft was one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        balloons. It was quite a rewarding experience. The reason that the RAAF has a balloon in 28 Squadron is that it promotes recruitment to the RAAF and particularly promotes the reserves and a career in the reserves. The mobility of the balloons enables them to travel to many regional areas to promote the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        . I am certainly a very strong supporter of that. The balloon can support events where it may not be feasible to send other Air Force aircraft. Balloons are able to launch from an open field rather than an airfield and then conduct low-level flights, so Air Force balloon crews have a great opportunity to engage local communities. This is especially true when the balloons are deployed to support regional events, providing the public with tethered rides.
       </p>
       <p>
        A word to Defence Force reservist employers: employers must understand that their employees can go off and learn a whole new skill set that brings benefit to the employer’s business. Defence Force reservist employers should understand this opportunity—that they get better people working for them because they have spent some time in the reserves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Air Force is a rich training ground. I encourage employers and industry to support any of their staff who are considering joining or who are already members of the Reserve forces because their military skills enrich their workplace. I close by saying this is not only about Air Force; it is a tri-service matter. There are many great careers in the Defence Force these days, many exciting opportunities, and the government is very keen to see more people join the reserves and the regulars.
