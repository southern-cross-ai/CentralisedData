       <p>
        I would like to raise, again, in this chamber the issue of media ownership. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know my longstanding interest in this matter. At the heart of our democracy is the need for fair and balanced media reporting. Last week I, along with many Australians, was very concerned that the wealthiest citizen of Australia signalled her intention to acquire a controlling interest or to engage in a full takeover of our second largest media company in Australia, Fairfax.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think there is an urgent need for Ms Rinehart to indicate that this is a friendly takeover, to maximise the benefit of its shareholders. Sadly, there are many reports in the media that this is not the case and there is a threat, potentially, if editors and journalists do not support her commercial agenda, as someone who is fiercely opposed to the minerals resource rent tax and supports global warming deniers. I think that is a terrible threat to public interest, to the future of our democracy because, as I said, at the heart of our democracy is the very need to have fair and balanced reporting.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not saying that Miss Rinehart should not express her views—she is entitled to express the views that she has expressed—but she is not entitled to trash our democracy and remove editors and journalists if they express opinions that are contrary to the opinions that are held by her. So I ask today that Miss Rinehart come out and indicate her intentions in relation to media ownership and let Australians know that this is a friendly takeover or controlling interest and that the public interest and our democracy will not be trashed.
       </p>

        Question agreed to.
