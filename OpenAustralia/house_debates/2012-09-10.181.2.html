        I rise today to pay my respects on the condolence motion on the deaths of Lance Corporal Stjepan (Rick) Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. All three men were tragically killed by an insider attack at Patrol Base Wahab in Uruzgan province on 29 August this year. This was a tragedy for their families and is a tragedy for our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Robert Poate was a member of the 3rd Battalion,

       </p>
       <p>
        As is often the case when an Australian diggers loses his life, the family issues a statement which Defence releases. The statement on behalf of Lance Corporal Milosevic's family includes these lines:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At Kapooka, Rick was awarded Most Outstanding Soldier, and during his Junior Leaders Course, he was presented with the award for the Trainee of Merit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our family is now united by grief as we try to come to terms with the loss of Rick … this is our private time to grieve and we would like our privacy, especially that of Rick's children, to be respected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The family deserve their privacy. They also need to know that Lance Corporal Milosevic served his country bravely and we are all very proud of his service and his sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sapper James Thomas Martin was on his first operational deployment as a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Task Group. He enlisted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        on 24 January 2011 and was later allocated to the Corps of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Engineers" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Engineers
        </a>
        . He completed a number of additional courses, including Combat Engineer High Threat Search, Communications and Weapon courses, and was highly decorated with honours, including the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non-Article 5 Medal with clasp ISAF and the Army Combat Badge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statement released by the family on behalf of Sapper James Martin reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was very thoughtful, caring and considerate of others. This really showed when selecting gifts for family members on special occasions. James always seemed to be able to choose something perfect, even if it was something totally unexpected by the recipient at the time. The family's bookshelves are peppered with books gifted by James; and Holly's iPod filled with music selected by him.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        James was a wonderful person and he will be sorely missed by his family and anyone who knew him.

       <p>
        I visited Afghanistan with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        last year. I saw firsthand the enormous sacrifice and contribution being made by the more than 1,500 Australian defence personnel, men and women in uniform. In this place as elected representatives of the Australian people we have a huge responsibility to ensure that our men and women in uniform get the best protection possible but also to ensure that they are participating in a just cause. I believe that, despite the difficulties and the challenges we are facing, and despite the tragic loss of 38 Australian lives, we need to remain the course in Afghanistan. By being in Afghanistan we are taking the fight right up to the terrorists who have taken the lives of more than 100 Australians since 9-11. In each case the perpetrators of those attacks, whether in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        , Bali or Jakarta, had links back to Afghanistan. This is why we are there. But there needs to be an exit date, and there is—in 2014. As parliamentarians we have enormous responsibilities, and I say to the families of each of these three men: your country is extremely grateful for the service and sacrifice of your fathers, your brothers and your sons.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I say of Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate, Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic and Sapper James Thomas Martin: your lives were not lost in vain; we are proud of your sacrifice and, on behalf of a grateful nation, we say lest we forget.

         Among the fallen that we remember today is Canberra-born Private Robert Poate. This young, promising and highly qualified soldier's life was cut short by a rogue Afghan solider in Uruzgan province last month. He was on his first tour of duty. Today we offer our deepest condolences to Private Poate's colleagues, friends and, most of all, his family: Hugh, Janny and Nicola. As a soldier, a mate, a brother and a son, this tragic loss has been keenly felt by Canberra's close-knit community.
        </p>
        <p>
         After enlisting in 2009, Private Poate rapidly earned a reputation for his professionalism and his leadership qualities. Private Poate completed specialist training as a Protected Mobility Vehicle Driver one year after his initial employment training and went on to complete training as a Protected Mobility Vehicle Commander last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was also renowned for his strong leadership skills, completing a promotion course for corporal, also in 2011. Private Poate was recognised for his achievements and was awarded the following awards: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Active_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Active Service Medal
         </a>
         with clasp
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAT" rel="nofollow">
          ICAT
         </a>
         , the Afghan Campaign Medal, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Medal
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
          NATO
         </a>
         Non-Article 5 Medal with clasp
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
          ISAF
         </a>
         , and the Infantry Combat Badge.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, beyond the official acclamations, Private Poate will also be remembered for his larrikinism. His close friend rugby paralympian Cody Meakin remembers Private Poate as being 'just a lad'. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         He was cheeky, always had a cheeky grin. Nothing ever phased him … He was just a top bloke, one of the most genuine and loyal blokes I had the pleasure of hanging out with. He always had time for me. Not because he felt sorry for me, but because he genuinely wanted to hang out.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cody Meakin has since had his wheelchair inscribed with a special tribute to his fallen friend. He says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … hopefully it'll give me a bit more in the tank, to try that little bit harder …
        </p>
        <p>
         Private Poate's brothers by choice in the 6th Battalion of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Regiment
         </a>
         offer a similar portrait:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Private Poate had a reputation for creating mischief without getting caught and was proud of his family, his military service, his Canberran origins, and his red hair, which he vehemently defended as being strawberry blonde.
        </p>
        <p>
         The broader Canberra community also share warm memories of Private Poate. Justin Garrick, the head of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
          Canberra Grammar School
         </a>
         , where Private Poate spent 15 of his too short 23 years, recalls:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … an open and purposeful young man and an all-rounder in the academic, sporting and co-curricular life of the School. He was also the son of Mrs Janny Poate, who recently retired as receptionist at the front office of the Senior School after more than two decades’ association
        </p>
        <p>
         The service that was held at Canberra Grammar to remember Private Poate reminds me of that quote sometimes attributed to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Wellington" rel="nofollow">
          Duke of Wellington
         </a>
         that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Waterloo
         </a>
         was won on the playing fields of Eton. All the descriptions of Private Poate paint a portrait of a talented, spirited and fiercely loyal young man. His death is a loss for the whole nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         He died in a green-on-blue attack, part of a worrying trend in Afghanistan. This year over 30 NATO troops have died from such attacks, more than twice as many as last year. The leader of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         war effort in Afghanistan, Marine General John Allen, is convening a meeting of all US and NATO flag officers to assess the phenomenon. I am not sure that we know everything about what is causing these green-on-blue attacks, but I do think in part that they reflect our success in changing the Afghan military for the better. I think what we are seeing with these green-on-blue attacks is the desperate attacks of an extremist movement that knows it has run out of all other options apart from infiltrating the Afghan military. I do hope we are able to revamp the screening processes for Afghan soldiers, because the abuse of trust that these green-on-blue attacks cause is extraordinarily damaging for Australia in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         The loss of Private Poate reminded me of those classic words from Pericles's funeral oration
         <i>
         </i>
         2,500 years back, but they ring through the ages. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her … none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger … reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk …
        </p>
        <p>
         As Pericles said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         So died these men as became Athenians. You, their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you may pray that it may have a happier issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The selfless bravery of Private Poate and the other brave men who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, their dedication and their service should provide this House with a great perspective on our own responsibility. His contribution has made a difference. It will not be forgotten. May he and his fellow soldiers rest in peace.

          It is with much sadness that I rise this afternoon to speak on this motion of condolence on the deaths of Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. These three men were based at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
           Gallipoli Barracks
          </a>
          at Enoggera and their loss has had a devastating impact on the Defence community in Brisbane. I recently telephoned Brigadier Greg Bilton, Commander of the 7th Brigade, to offer my sincere condolences. He just confirmed to me how devastated the Defence community was.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defence" rel="nofollow">
           The Defence
          </a>
          community is tightly knit and, particularly in the Enoggera area, enjoys the support of the local community as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          As we know, these three soldiers were killed in an absolutely appalling green on blue attack on Australia's worst day in Afghanistan. It has been noted that not since the Battle of Nui Le in Vietnam on 21 September 1971 has Australia lost five men over a 24-hour period. Following the deaths of two other soldiers in a helicopter crash on the same fateful day, Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan now number 39.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lance Corporal Milosevic joined the Army at 36. He was awarded Most Outstanding Soldier and, during his junior leader course, he was presented with the award for Trainee of Merit. He was promoted relatively quickly to lance corporal and in his four years of service he fought both in Iraq and in Afghanistan. The family's statement upon hearing of this terrible loss had this to say:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Rick was a typical Australian bloke, friendly, with a dry sense of humour and a natural charm. He had a comfortable ease. He would show respect to everyone he met.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We are all proud of what Rick was able to achieve—not only as a soldier, but as a loving partner, devoted father, son and brother.

          Sapper James Martin was remembered by his family as a loving son, brother and grandson. He took great pleasure in playing the guitar. He loved to read books regularly and was also an avid gamer. He loved playing cricket and he liked to watch a game of

          with family and friends. He enlisted in the Army as a combat engineer and was on his first tour of duty. There is a lovely story about his first letter home from Kapooka, where some of his mates were homesick and were discussing pulling out of the really tough training. Kapooka is a very tough environment. I have visited on many occasions. Putting aside the coldness of the place, James wrote to his family saying, 'I will not give up this opportunity for anything. I will be an Australian soldier.' Such passion, determination and courage is truly admirable. His death is felt by all Australians but especially his mother, Suzanne, his sister, Holly, and his brother, Angus.

          Private Robert Poate enlisted in the Army in 2009 and was also on his first tour of duty. He was initially posted as a rifleman to the 6th Battalion

          Private Poate, as we heard earlier from the member for Fraser, who spoke about attending Private Poate's memorial service, was a Canberra Grammar Old Boy. He is survived by his parents, Hugh and Jenny, and his sister, Nicola.

          All three soldiers were deployed to Afghanistan with the 3RAR task force. These three soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation and history will record them as true Australian soldiers. I want to pay tribute to their families. I know that they have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many will have opinions about how long we should stay in Afghanistan, but what is very clear is that we need to stay the course. We need to stay there until the mission is completed and we need to continue the fight against terrorism. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of these fine Australians. We honour their service and we salute their contribution. May they rest in peace.

           As part of the Defence family I was honoured to attend the memorial service of these brave men at the Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, last Friday. All three were based in Brisbane and had been serving with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment Task Group on operations in Afghanistan when they were killed by an insider attack while off duty in the Baluchi Valley region of Uruzgan province. Let there be no mincing of words here today. These men did not die in battle, as every soldier is prepared to do. They did not die under orders from their superiors, or standing to the last man with their comrades against all odds or rescuing a mate under fire. They were murdered, and it was done by a man whom they had volunteered to help, teach and train so that he in turn could contribute to the rebuilding of his country.

           Our national commitment to the war in Afghanistan has particular resonance with the men, women and their families at Gallipoli Barracks in the electorate of Ryan. When the House last adjourned, as part of the ADF parliamentary program, I travelled with my colleague the member of Dickson and two of our Senate colleagues to Afghanistan, where we spent 10 days embedded with our soldiers in Kandahar and Tarin Kot. It was a confronting visit, where I saw first-hand the sacrifices made by those men and women who choose to live the life of a soldier, who choose to serve our national interests, who choose to serve our country and who choose to put their lives on the line when called to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           To lose three men in such a dreadful way so soon after our return home to Brisbane was indeed very sobering. It reminded us all of the true responsibilities of office and the significant decisions that we make on behalf of our community and country. Lance Corporal Milosevic joined the army when he was 36, carrying on a proud family tradition. In his four short years of service he served honourably in Iraq and Afghanistan. His colleagues said his dedication to the army combined with a strong sense of right and wrong saw him rise within army ranks, where he achieved so much in such a short period of time. He was a leader. He put his soldiers ahead of himself. He loved his family and spoke of them often. I pass on my sincere condolences to his wife Kelly, daughters Sarah and Kate, his mother, brothers and sisters.

           Twenty-one-year-old Sapper James Martin was on his first operational deployment as part of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment task group. Once James had made his decision to enlist in the army as a combat engineer, he remained very determined and focused on his goal. In his first-ever home at Kapooka, when some of his section mates were homesick and discussing pulling out of the training, James wrote to his family saying, 'I would not give up this opportunity for anything' and 'I will be an Australian soldier'. I pass on my sincere condolences to his family and friends.

           Private Poate was known for having outstanding leadership potential, which led to him completing a promotion course for corporal in 2011. Private Poate had a reputation for creating mischief without getting caught and was proud of his family, his military service and his red hair—which he vehemently defended as being strawberry blonde. I pass on my sincere condolences to his parents, Hugh and Jenny, and his sister, Nicola.
          </p>

           In closing, I would like to quote a part of the soldiers prayer, which I was privileged to share with the families and colleagues of Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper Martin and Private Poate during the memorial service at Gallipoli Barracks last Friday.

           For a soldier and for the comrades he or she leaves behind, this was a cruel death. Betrayal from within, betrayal from a comrade, is something that damages the whole company far beyond the grief of losing a mate. The feeling that you may be attacked from within makes a soldier doubt themselves and everyone around them and is therefore more a terrorist attack than an act of war. It is for this reason that we should not falter from our mission in Afghanistan. We must not allow the deaths of these brave men to be in vain. Lest we forget.
