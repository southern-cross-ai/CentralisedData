       <p>
        Today I want to raise the issue of Cerebral Palsy Tasmania and its contract to operate the tip shop at Margate. Of all the layers of administration which interact with constituents, local government is closer and more responsive than state or federal jurisdictions. Local government delivers services to residents within their immediate area, having regard to access, equity and need. Service delivery to all regardless of gender, ability, race or religion is the mandate. Sometimes it seems our local governments lose their focus and stray from their direction—and, in so doing, cause an immense disruption to segments of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this tale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingborough_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kingborough Council
        </a>
        has, through a tender process that is overtly squeaky clean, diverted funds from a not-for-profit group, Cerebral Palsy Tasmania, to the private enterprise Mornington Park, operated by Wesley Hazell. Why would Kingborough Council choose to divert funds in this way—deciding through a tender process that does not include assessment of community benefit, a consideration of social and moral issues, and a consideration of what would happen to the people assisted by Cerebral Palsy Tasmania if their major source of funding were to disappear? We may never know. Kingborough Council may argue that the funding of Cerebral Palsy Tasmania is not their concern—and in strict terms it is not—but where would we be if councils nationwide took that attitude?
       </p>
       <p>
        Kingborough Council have been silent on their deliberations except to say that occupational health and safety issues were at the heart of their decision. I have also heard that levels of recycling have to increase and that the new contractor will be able to do it better. On that point, surely it rested with the council to work with Cerebral Palsy Tasmania to see how they could do it better. Council is well aware of the date in March 2007 when health and safety accreditation was to be awarded to Cerebral Palsy Tasmania. Cerebral Palsy Tasmania kept the council informed of their progression towards this quality assessment. Such assessment does not happen overnight. We are aware that Cerebral Palsy Tasmania has not been funded by taxpayers for quite some time. The organisation has stood on its own. It has employed a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , administration staff and 15 staff at the tip shop. Cerebral Palsy Tasmania has provided services to the cerebral palsy community without being a drain on the community. That is about to change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cerebral Palsy Tasmania want their people with disabilities to continue doing what they have always done. They are now looking for premises near the tip in Margate to create a new recycling centre for Kingborough. They want all people who use the Kingborough tip to recycle their material at the cerebral palsy centre once it has been established. I want everyone to be exceedingly clear about the motive for this action: Cerebral Palsy Tasmania have been self-funding for years and they want to continue to be self-funding. Establishing an alternative recycling centre gives residents a choice: support cerebral palsy or Mornington park. I would say: support Cerebral Palsy Tasmania. They want your recyclables, and I say they deserve your support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here was a partnership that benefited our society and contributed to the overall balance of our community by funding Cerebral Palsy Tasmania’s activities. Kingborough Council have rent that partnership asunder. We know there are many groups of disadvantaged people in our society, and we are always being asked to put our hand out and contribute to raffles, quiz nights and golf days, and so it goes on. Kingborough Council have chosen to redistribute the wealth of their recycling operation from the community to private enterprise. Cerebral Palsy Tasmania will now join the ranks of other organisations putting their hands out to the public and government. There is a lot of money at stake in this industry. Private enterprise have had their eyes on the Kingborough location for a few years. They are keenly interested because of the large amount of money generated. After all, it kept Cerebral Palsy Tasmania operating for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        How will Cerebral Palsy Tasmania make up any shortfall in their funds? Will the state or federal governments be able to provide bridging funding, plots of land, vacant buildings and the like to keep them going? There is a real risk that Cerebral Palsy Tasmania may fold. If they do fold, it will be a direct result of the Kingborough Council’s decision. If Cerebral Palsy Tasmania do fold, who will be there to provide the services to those people with cerebral palsy that Cerebral Palsy Tasmania provide so remarkably well?
