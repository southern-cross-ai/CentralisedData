        Over the summer recess, I was privileged to attend the Waikerie Australia Day Extravaganza, where I saw Dylan Ellis awarded the Waikerie Young Person of the Year Award. I am inspired by and in full admiration of Dylan. He is a great role model for our young people in Australia. Dylan was a national dirt kart title holder and a state title holder. As well as that, he was a talented knee boarder and an accomplished footballer. In 2013 Dylan was travelling home from schoolies. Four minutes away from home, Dylan, through no fault of his own, was involved in a serious accident with a B-double wine tanker. Dylan almost lost his life on that day. He spent over 40 hours on the operating table, and there was uncertainty about whether he would ever walk again. Nine months and five days from the accident, Dylan was back on the knee board and had plans to race again, on a smaller scale. Although the accident has taken a huge toll on Dylan personally, he does not feel sorry for himself. Now, at the age of 19, has made a documentary entitled
        <i>
         Desireâ€”Dylan Ellis
        </i>
        , on his journey, which was released on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        in early November. The documentary serves to warn young people that, just because you do all the right things, it does not mean that bad things still will not happen to you. Dylan also spends time counselling youth, and his message is simple: focus on your goals, never give up and be positive, because anything is possible.
