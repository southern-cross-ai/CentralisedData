       <p class="italic">
        (a)the Senate voted yesterday to support a government bill to repeal the 'Medevac' law, which was helping sick people get the medical treatment they need;

        (b)Senator Lambie has repeatedly said she placed a secret condition on her support for the bill, and then told the Senate yesterday that she had secured a deal with the government which led to her voting for the repeal bill, saying 'So I put a proposal to the government, and since then we have worked together really hard to advance that proposal. We've worked to an outcome I believe we both want … As a result of that work, I'm more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.';

        (f)this secrecy and lack of transparency from the Government fundamentally undermines trust in democracy and this Parliament; and
       </p>

        (2)therefore requires the Prime Minister to attend the chamber by 12 noon today to respond to Senator Lambie's statements made in the Senate yesterday, to fully explain the details of all deals, arrangements and understandings with Senator Lambie regarding the 'Medevac' repeal bill and table any associated documents or letters.
