        ) ( ): On Friday, 30 October, I held a breast cancer morning tea where over 100 women in the Belmont area came along and donated to breast cancer research. It was a fantastic morning and we had some wonderful speakers: Anna Fitzgerald from the Australia and New Zealand

        Trials and Lisa from the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation. In addition to that, we had the wonderful Carolyn Bear there with the beautiful jewellery she makes, which I am wearing today. She donates the profits to breast cancer and ovarian cancer research. We had a number of women there who had previously had breast cancer. The most recent case was five months ago, and the person who was the longest breast cancer survivor there has survived it for 35 years. It was a very informative morning and it was a very fun morning. We managed to raise in excess of $1,500 for breast cancer, which we divided up between the Australia and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials and the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation. I thank everybody who was involved in the morning, including Joanne Connors, who was there with her fashion wear and apparel, for the wonderful fashion parade that she put on that day.
