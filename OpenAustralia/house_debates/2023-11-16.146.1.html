       <p>
        Last month I was thrilled to attend the launch of the new, one-of-a-kind venture called Somewhere Nice. Somewhere Nice is the brainchild of Grace Fava, the powerhouse founder and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Autism Advisory and Support Service. The service provides a huge range of services to support, advocate, help, educate and guide families who have a family member with autism, as well as the greater community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grace's passion to support people with autism and their families was ignited when searching for services for her two boys who both regressed with autism and global developmental delay. In 2007, Grace gathered seven other like-minded parents around her kitchen table and made plans for a modest information service to provide support and information specifically to those for whom language was a problem and other difficulties made it impossible for them to find suitable supports for their newly diagnosed children. From these humble beginnings, the service now employs more than 25 staff in a range of health disciplines to nurture and support those living with autism. The organisation is about ensuring that every child has the best opportunities for the most productive and meaningful life possible, just like any other child in our society. I've had the privilege of visiting the centre and talking to Grace about her genuine love and passion for every person and every family she meets. Grace is warm and kind, and we need more like her in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the opening, one of Grace's boys did a splendid job with his colleagues in welcoming guests, taking coffee orders and serving food. Located in the Liverpool CBD at 36 Railway Street, Liverpool, Somewhere Nice is an opportunity shop and cafe that works in collaboration with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        New South Wales to enable the participants to gain a tertiary education in retail and hospitality in a safe and supported environment that takes into account the disabilities they have. Empowerment in an inclusive workplace will give the individuals the opportunities to develop skills and pursue careers like anyone else. The grand opening also marked the beginning of a beautiful journey towards a more inclusive community for those individuals living with autism and their families. Somewhere Nice is a place where diversity is celebrated, and the people that it is made for are at the heart of everything that's done thereâ€”and they have really great coffee, tea, hot chocolate and treats. Congratulations, Grace, and all involved in supporting and getting the idea off the ground. I know you've worked so hard on it, and I look forward to visiting again soon.
