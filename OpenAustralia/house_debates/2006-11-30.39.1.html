        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Minister, is it not the case that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Employment_Advocate" rel="nofollow">
         Office of the Employment Advocate
        </a>
        has officially advised employees of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, in a letter dated 6 October:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Employees wanted to know whether or not they could negotiate a new collective agreement with Aboriginal Hostels Limited instead of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        s. The short answer is no. The employer decides what type of agreement they will use. The employer chooses what agreements they will offer and what they will negotiate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister point out to the hundreds of thousands of Australians who marched against the government’s extreme and unfair industrial relations laws today where the choice is in that?

         The first thing I will say to the member for Perth is that I will check the facts because every other time you come in here, mate, you mislead! We had the member for Perth in here yesterday misleading the parliament about the situation at the

          Commonwealth Bank

           Yes. It is a bit of a contest between the roosters as to who misleads this place the most.

               <p>
                I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The member for Hinkler, representing a couple of very important ports in Queensland, would recognise that many of the predictions about previous reforms have been proven to be totally incorrect and that the reforms introduced by our government over the years, particularly with regard to the efficiency of ports, have certainly been achieved. I give the example of the waterfront reform that was undertaken by this government, which has significantly boosted the competitiveness and efficiency of our export industries and has seen crane rates in our container ports in 2006 go up to 27.7 movements per hour. In 1996 they were 16.9 movements per hour. Just as every other prediction by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Labor Party
                </a>
                and the union movement about reform in the workplace has been proven to be incorrect, they said this could not be done. They said you could not improve upon crane rates of 16.9 lifts per hour. Well, we have; that has taken place. The Australian Labor Party and the union movement have said in their scare campaign about
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                 Work Choices
                </a>
                that this is about slashing wages, that it is about reducing levels of employment, that it is a green light for mass sackings—all the emotive lines that have been used in their scare campaign that continued today.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reality is that unemployment in Australia has hit a record low of 4.6 per cent. In the last 10 years, 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the economy in Australia. In that period, real wages have increased by 16.5 per cent. Since Work Choices was introduced, 165,000 new jobs have been created in the marketplace. Interestingly, 62 per cent of areas in regional Australia now have unemployment levels of lower than five per cent. We all remember what unemployment was like in regional Australia under the administration of the last Labor government. The Labor Party and the union movement—the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
                 ACTU
                </a>
                —will continue their scare campaign, but the working men and women of Australia recognise what has taken place in this country under the coalition government to improve their circumstances, living standards and the economy in Australia. They recognise that the most important point is the real wage increase over the last 10 years of 16.5 per cent, which is the very reason they believe that the coalition government is a true friend of Australia’s workers.

                 My question to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations follows his claim, in the answer to the previous question asked of him, about the member for Perth misleading in the questions he asks in this place. On the subject of misleading, minister: where in this document of your election policy did you indicate what you intended to do on penalty rates? Where in this document did you indicate to the Australian people what you intended to do about unfair dismissals? Where in this document did you indicate what you intended to do about the status of the independent umpire? Where in this document did you state what you intended to do about people’s right to be appropriately represented by a union? Talk about misleading! Where in this serially misleading document did you tell the Australian people anything about the attacks you intended to make on their family life?

                             Here is the figure to get in your minds: since Work Choices came into effect, 165,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. Get this figure in your mind: since Work Choices came into effect, four times the crowd at the MCG has been created in new jobs. That is 165,000 new jobs. Four times the number that rolled out at the MCG today have found work with new jobs as a consequence of Work Choices. The truth of the matter is that today was a political stunt. It flopped. Today will not interrupt the creation of new jobs. Today we continue with economic reform in Australia.

                               If that is the best they can come up with, they are getting pretty desperate! What families today want is to have flexibility in their working arrangements. That is what families want. Yesterday the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition paraded the example of the
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                                Commonwealth Bank

                               . The Commonwealth Bank, as part of these changes, are able to provide more flexibility in employment. They are trying to employ people on weekends. They have 700 places available. Do you know how many people have applied for those 700 jobs which involve work on a Saturday morning when the banks will be open, which will be more family friendly as well? Two thousand three hundred people have applied for those 700 jobs.

                               The contrast here is very stark. The contrast is between providing flexibility that employees want in the workplace and the inflexible, rigid system—the one-size-fits-all system—which the Labor Party want to take us back to in Australia. The reality is that Australian workers and their families are voting with their feet and they have rejected your proposition.

                                   I thank the member for Blair for his question. The changes put in place since 27 March have led to very significant benefits for Australians, Australian workers and Australian families. We have seen jobs growth, wages growth, record low industrial disputation, record low retrenchments in Australia, a 20-year long-term unemployment rate low and strong productivity growth.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Let me take a little bit of the economic data about what has happened in the last six to eight months in Australia. For example, as the Treasurer has said, 165,000 Australians are in new jobs since 27 March this year, and 129,000 of those jobs are full-time jobs. But let me give you the significance of that historically. The job creation average for the last 20 years was just 70,000 jobs, and yet we have seen 165,000 jobs created since

                                   was introduced this year. There is a 30-year unemployment low of 4.6 per cent.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   We have wages continuing to grow. As I said earlier, tomorrow the lowest paid workers in Australia—one million of them—will get something which the Leader of the Opposition, the Labor Party and the labour movement said would not happen, because they said this was about driving down wages. Tomorrow, the one million lowest paid Australian workers will get a $27 increase in their pay packet. That is good news for Australian workers; it is something which the Labor Party said was not going to happen. We have the lowest levels of industrial disputes on record—and records in one form or another go back to before Gallipoli.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said that the changes would lead to a situation where employers and employees would be at each other’s throats. Indeed, the contrary has occurred. We have a record low number of job retrenchments—the lowest for two decades in Australia—and long-term unemployed figures are also at 20-year lows.
                                  </p>

                                   When you cut away the rhetoric of the opposition and the labour movement about this and look not just at the anecdotal evidence but at the official ABS data about what has happened in Australia, all of that data points to benefits for Australian workers and their families as a result of these changes. Yet we still have the Leader of the Opposition maintaining this scare campaign down there at the

                                   today, saying he is going to rip up changes that bring advantages for Australians into the future. All of his predictions have been proven false over the last six to eight months since Work Choices came into place.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Why does he want to do this? Because, in contrast to us—we are concerned about the national interest and how we continue to grow this country—the Leader of the Opposition is only interested in vested interests. He is only interested in his job, rather than jobs for all Australians. He is bitterly disappointed, I am sure, by the embarrassingly low turnout that they got at the MCG today. Look at all the excuses they are trying to make about why only half the number of people that they predicted were actually there. The reality is that these are changes which are good for Australia. This side of politics is prepared to make the decisions to ensure that Australia continues to grow. The only interest the other side has is: who is the Leader of the Opposition?

My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and it follows the question he was just asked about the impact of the law on family life. I refer to an Australian workplace agreement offered by confectionery manufacturer Australian Sweets to its employees which provides for work at any hour of the day on any day of the week without compensation for inconvenient hours. Why do you arrogantly ignore hundreds of thousands of Australians who told you today that

                                     One thing that has become clear over the last few months is that, when the opposition has come in here and made claims about some particular agreement, those claims, when investigated, have not stood up. I do not accept for one moment any allegation or assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday he was in here making assertions about a
