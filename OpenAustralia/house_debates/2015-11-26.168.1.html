        In an unremarkable grave, in the Seymour Cemetery, is a small wooden cross. On this wooden cross is a plaque with the inscription: 'B4/707. Private J E Docherty. Result of an accident. 12/11/1950. 19 years.' It is the final resting place of Private John Edward Docherty. As Chalpat Sonti wrote in the
        <i>
         Seymour Telegraph
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's ironic that with 2015 designated as the year Australia Remembers, commemorating the centenary of the Gallipoli landings and the sacrifice of soldiers burned so deeply into the nation’s psyche, we should be publishing a story like this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This tale began in the spring of 2014, when Army veteran Ossie Taylor noticed a derelict grave … Mr Taylor doesn't miss much around town, and he came into the Telegraph office to talk about a sight that distressed him—a soldier that did not seem to be remembered in the way he should be, and it was hard to disagree when looking at the grave.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ossie spoke to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        member and nasho Keith Murphy, who wrote to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Australian_War_Graves" rel="nofollow">
         Office of Australian War Graves
        </a>
        , seeking an official grave for Private Docherty, much like the one that backs onto his in the cemetery. Then came the first setback: advice from the Office of Australian War Graves was that Private Docherty was not eligible for an official grave as he did not meet the criteria around war service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keith then enlisted the assistance of Chalpat and myself. The grave is not befitting a soldier's grave, so I contacted veterans' affairs minister, Senator Michael Ronaldson. Ronno understood our position, but it was pretty clear that we were going to be on our own.
       </p>
       <p>
        So who was Private

        </a>
        and how did he die? Research revealed that Private Doherty was the eldest son of a separated mother and father, and that he had two younger brothers and a sister. Only three or four death notices in Trove were all we could find in the hunt for Private Docherty's family. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n police archives indicated that John might have had a few scuffs with the law when he was a kid. With limited information, I roped in the support of Senator for South Australia, Senator Gallacher, who also searched every name in the notices in an attempt to find a living relative.
       </p>
       <p>
        I personally rang or Facebook messaged every one of the Dochertys in South Australia in the hope of contacting a relative. Unfortunately, my efforts were in vain; despite some long, hard legwork we exhausted that avenue. But that was not the end of it. With the support of Gerard O'Rourke of the Seymour Cemetery Trust we decided, like the old adage, that 'if it is to be it is up to me'. We enlisted local support. Firstly, the CO of the School of Armour offered some men to come to help with the clean-up. The Mitchell shire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Rebecca McKenzie, was also prepared to have the council chip in, and the cemetery trust offered bluestone and other materials to help.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local businesses got involved. Gayle from North Central Locksmiths volunteered to redress the plaque and to supply a new, complementing one. Modular Concrete Sleepers in Seymour and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MJ" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        's Garden Maintenance gladly supplied the materials to create a new headstone and border. How do you thank these people enough?
       </p>
       <p>
        Chalpat's investigative skills delivered the story behind John Docherty. Private Docherty, along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Bush" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Bush
        </a>
        , died as the result of a motorcycle collision with a ute on the Seymour-Yea Road. Bush was riding the motorbike and Docherty was the pillion passenger. They were heading towards Seymour and near the racecourse turnoff when the motorbike pulled out to pass a car and the crash happened. Both men on the motorbike were members of the School of Tactics Seymour.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incident happened 65 years ago, but some memories are still etched in the minds of those who knew him. Nagambie resident, Robert 'Bardy' McLeod, whose sister Joyce was dating Private Docherty at the time, recalled the incident for Chalpat:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘‘She (Joyce) was waiting for him (Private Docherty) at Goulburn Park,’’ Mr McLeod said.
       </p>
       <p>
        But he never arrived—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It appears the funeral was low-key, and not an official Army one.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud that this young servicemen will be remembered in the way that he should be, as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        —regardless of the timing or the manner of his death.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of the day, the project has been driven by the community for the community. After 65 years and having no immediate family to remember him, Private Docherty's grave has suffered neglect. But no more, his little wooden cross with the small brass clerk sitting askew. Private Docherty has not been forgotten, and in the year that Australia remembers it is a small but sweet victory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the great work and generosity of our community, Private John Edwin Docherty has a fitting place to be remembered. Again, our community showed why in times of need the community of Seymour can be relied on to right a wrong.
