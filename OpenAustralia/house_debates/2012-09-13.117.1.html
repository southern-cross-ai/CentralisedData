        I rise today to share information about the great work of one of the local community groups in my electorate. Dragons Abreast Bribie Island is a group of ladies who regularly get together to paddle up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumicestone_Passage" rel="nofollow">
         Pumicestone Passage
        </a>
        . But these ladies are not just sports enthusiasts; there is a very important purpose behind this simple activity. Dragons Abreast Bribie Island is a support group, both in the emotional and physical sense, to ladies in my local community who are recovering from breast cancer. Together the ladies paddle canoes, and the physical act of paddling specifically helps with muscle regeneration. But, more than that, the relationships that the ladies develop help them with the difficult transition from treatment to recovery and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago I braved an early morning to meet with the ladies of Dragons Abreast Bribie Island for the regular paddle up the Pumicestone Passage. I have done a lot of kayaking up the passage—I grew up kayaking up the passage—but canoeing with the Ladies of Dragons Abreast Bribie Island is something else altogether. The camaraderie and support between the ladies that I witnessed are quite incredible. It is not difficult to see how important these times are for these special ladies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dragons Abreast Bribie Island was founded four years ago and has already come a long way. The idea itself came from a lady by the name of Dawn Worley, who, after herself experiencing breast cancer and seeing firsthand the challenges associated with recovery, saw the need to provide a support group for others in a similar position.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dawn recognised that individuals recovering from breast cancer need some help for both the body and for the soul, which is exactly what she saw that Dragons Abreast would provide. Dawn worked tirelessly to raise the funds so that Dragons Abreast could purchase the boats that they now use. Without Dawn's hard work, the generous contribution of donors in my local community and the commitment of other ladies who were determined to see this project come to fruition, this great local initiative would not have been possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is difficult to quantify how much Dragons Abreast Bribie Island means to the local ladies, it is clear from the smiles and from the laughter that I witnessed out on the passage on that cold morning that Dragons Abreast is a very vital part of recovery for many women who have had breast cancer. To all of the ladies who regularly dedicate their time to being a mentor to the other ladies, thank you. Thank you for making our community a richer place. I look forward to getting back out on the passage—on the beautiful Pumicestone Passage—again with these inspirational ladies to offer my support to the incredible work that they do. Thank you, ladies.
