        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of putting in place the right policies to spread the benefits of the mining boom to all corners of the economy?

         I thank the member for

          La Trobe
         </a>
         for this very important question. As we saw last week, the Australian economy continues to grow, and this is despite the turbulence we have seen particularly in Europe. We do have a very big investment pipeline in this country. Capital expenditure figures that were out last week showed that business is planning to invest a staggering $164 billion this year, and that is set to increase to $173 billion next year, which is a 28 per cent increase on the estimate last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of this investment is in resources. We understand that not everybody in our economy is in the fast lane of the resources boom and that there are many companies, particularly small businesses, that are not in that fast lane. That is why we must have the minerals resource rent tax and why we must use the stream of revenue from that tax to give some incentive and some extra lift, particularly to our struggling small businesses that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why we have brought this legislation out for public consultation and why we will be bringing this legislation to the House for passage through this House and through the Senate—because this will deliver a tax break for hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         What does the Leader of the Opposition have to say about all of this? He says no. He says: 'No, I can't support that. No way could I support that sort of sensible legislation.' Why does he say no? Why is he constantly saying no? Because he believes that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Rinehart" rel="nofollow">
          Gina Rinehart
         </a>
         and

           The party of Menzies, supposedly the party of small business, is opposing in this House tax cuts to 2.7 million small businesses in terms of the instant asset write-off and this very important legislation which will come to the House. So I challenge all of those opposite to support this legislation in the House because it is vital to economic growth in this country. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to tax reform which taxes the superprofits of the most profitable companies in the country and spreads it to every postcode across the country. That is what it does as—

                    Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Treasurer spoke particularly about the government's works for small business and I wonder if he could update the House with some more detail about what small businesses and working people in my electorate and communities like mine can get from this.

                     We want to see all businesses in the country benefit from the mining boom. We want to see the opportunities that are created spread right around our country. In the electorate of
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
                      La Trobe
                     </a>
                     the instant asset write-off will benefit 17,600 small businesses. But, of course, there will be a very significant boost to the superannuation savings of workers right around Australia and in La Trobe that will benefit 53,000 workers, because it is important to boost our national savings at a time of such large investment in our economy. It is also prudent to lift our national investment and at the same time lift the quality of life of people who are saving for their retirement. The other thing that we want to do is invest in critical infrastructure particularly in the mining region. So that is why we are backing the instant asset write-off, which will be particularly good for those that are wanting to buy a car: they can write off the first $5,000 of that. That will be very good for all those people that are driving utes. But also what we need to do is boost the superannuation savings of workers. If we are to successfully do all this we must bring our budget back to surplus because growth is coming back to trend. But we know why those opposite are opposing these cuts, because they have got a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line. That is why they are saying, 'No, no, no.'
