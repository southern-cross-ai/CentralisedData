         Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011
        </a>
        makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law to strengthen debt recovery and improve compliance and the administration of the childcare benefit.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments will make important changes to the family assistance administration act and other legislation to improve accountability in the childcare sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know how important this is.
       </p>
       <p>
        The overnight collapse of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Learning" rel="nofollow">
         ABC Learning
        </a>
        in 2008 was quite simply unprecedented.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government’s quick and decisive action meant that 90 per cent of these centres continue to operate for Australian families today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Had the government’s support not been provided, almost 100,000 families would have had to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2008 the government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will broaden the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law, to ensure that operators are fit and proper persons.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also enable the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another services operated by the same operator.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will ensure that operators that run up debts to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        For instance, this will stop an operator who accumulates debts, and then exits the market, from re-entering the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under current legislation, the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will facilitate a broader consideration of the childcare operators, associated organisations and individuals in both the approvals and ongoing approvals processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new approvals processes include financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet quality standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments in this bill represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market, and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the bill will also support the government’s $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes to protected information will support the national quality framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services with state and territory regulatory bodies.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will benefit services by not having to provide the same information to more than one body.
       </p>
       <p>
        The framework, endorsed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        , will:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         improve educator to child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention;
        </li>
        <li>
         introduce educator qualification requirements so educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop;
        </li>
        <li>
         include a new ratings system so parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices; and
        </li>
        <li>
         reduce regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        We are doing this because we know from years of international research that the first five years of a child’s life shapes their future—their health, learning and social development—and we want to make sure that future is bright.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
