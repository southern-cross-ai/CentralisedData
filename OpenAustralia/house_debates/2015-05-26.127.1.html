       <p>
        Today I speak on the issue of citizenship and my strong endorsement of the immigration minister's and the government's determination to act on the need to revoke the citizenship of those involved in terrorism. I certainly endorse this measure and the ability to revoke the citizenship of even those who may only have Australian citizenship but can claim another through the country of birth of their parents. The minister should have discretion to take those citizenships away.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I moved my motion on this issue back on 14 July 2014, I outlined a number of amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act and I hope the government will also make those amendments in the coming legislation. I have no doubt that there is very wide support for this measure. My petition on the revocation of citizenship was well supported and I know that my Victorian colleague Michael Sukkar, the member for Deakin, also found strong support in an online petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although I first raised this issue in my address-in-reply speech on 18 November 2013, those that try to suggest that this proposal is racist should be aware that on 5 July 2014 I made a speech in the Murray Street Mall of Perth where I told a group of 300 members of the Iraqi community of this proposal. It was very well supported by them as they hate radicals as well. Those that do try to derail legitimate debate in this country with their moral trump words of racism or Islamophobia should get out more and speak with the migrant communities for something of a new approach. Support for this action is strong and it is broad across recent migration communities and with those that have been here for a longer time. I endorse the ability to revoke citizenship. It is a good measure and its time has come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also say that just recently, on 25 May, I submitted another proposal regarding citizenship. This time I proposed a change to the citizenship ceremony preamble. I hope this will also encourage debate on this subject as well. It is my view that the preamble is currently too much of a restatement of the pledge. I believe that it should be a clearer statement on what citizenship is about. The preamble I propose as a basis for debate is: Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        . Every Australian citizen has rights and protections, but also serious responsibilities. Persons on whom Australian citizenship is conferred accept these obligations: (a) loyalty to Australia, its people and laws above all other nations, peoples and laws; and (b) commitment to the Australian democratic model of government and renouncing all other systems, be they political or religious; and (c) to respect the rights and liberties, of all people regardless of gender, race or religion, as all are equal before the law as Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal represents a reminder of the foundations that built this country and the expectations we have. I also think, just as a broader approach, that it would be a good thing that at each
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        ceremony each year and at every citizenship ceremony, existing citizens should also join with new citizens in saying the pledge. I think that would be a positive thing.
