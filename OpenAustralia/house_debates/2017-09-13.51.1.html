       <p>
        Later in September, it will be Men's Shed Week, and I would like to pay tribute to the benefits this organisation delivers in cities and towns right across Australia. In my own electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        , we are fortunate to have six Men's Sheds established in very different locations. Each is unique in style, because Men's Sheds members come from all walks of life. But the bond that unites them is having some spare time and the desire to do something useful in that time. They also share roles in promoting, supporting and improving men's health, which is so vital. I also congratulate the Men's Shed for all the toys they supply in the local area when it comes to Christmastime.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the volunteer work of each of the coordinators in La Trobe's Men's Shedsâ€”Lindsay Harding, at Akoonah Park Men's Shed in Berwick; John Podger, at Belgrave Men's Shed; Mike Allery, at Emerald Men's Shed; Walter Meuller, at The Gully Men's Shed;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Harrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , at The Hills Men's Shed; and Eric Bumpstead, at Upper Beaconsfield Men's Shed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, I would really like to thank the Men's Shed for all the fantastic work they have been doing in the electorate of La Trobe and right across the country. To those guys at home who feel they need to get out, to get into an activity and do something a bit different, I encourage them to join a local Men's Shed.
