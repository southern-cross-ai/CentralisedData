        I refer the Treasurer to his 14 December 2010 press conference where he was questioned as to whether it was an error to credit all state royalties under the heads of agreement signed with mining companies. The Treasurer replied, 'No, it’s not an error at all'. Does the Treasurer stand by his words, and will the Treasurer rule out any changes to the treatment of royalties under the mining tax: yes or no?

         I do thank that shadow Treasurer for his question, because I did answer that comprehensively yesterday. It is the case that they are a deductible credit—no doubt about that. That was contained in the report which was produced by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Ferguson, and Mr Argus, along with some advice that we should sit down with the states and work our way through all of these issues, which is precisely what we are doing as we speak. Our treasuries are engaged in this discussion, and they are engaged in this discussion for a very good reason: we want our resources industries to grow and prosper. The whole argument for a resource rent tax is that it is the most efficient way of generating growth and jobs in industry, as opposed to the regressive impact of royalties and how they punish projects, particularly those which have higher costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         What you have seen in the state of Queensland has been jacking up of royalties, which has cost jobs. We have not heard one peep from them about the job-destroying impact of what has gone on in Queensland from the royalty increases by the Queensland government. We are determined to work through with the states the intersection of a resource rent tax with royalties. That is what we have said we are doing, we have been doing it and we will continue to do it because it goes to the health of our industry which has been growing dramatically since we announced the introduction of the

                  distribution panel recommended, we have been working with the states to see if we can get a resolution to this issue. I would have thought that that is a very clear answer to the shadow Treasurer. But what is he really on about here? He is upset that there is a resource rent tax in the first place, and $1 of tax raised through resource rent taxes is an affront to everybody on that side of the House. We on this side of the House have a fundamental belief that the Australian people should be getting a share in the superprofits that are made from the resources that we own 100 per cent. That is why we have been a supporter of the

                   MRRT
                  </a>
                  and that is why we have been a supporter of the PRRT, which has raised something like $28 billion in the time that it has been in operation. And it was opposed by those opposite.

                   Madam Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Given the extreme concern of the Treasurer for the welfare of the states and given the fact that the Treasurer is concerned that royalties are a problem, will the Treasurer now guarantee that no state will be worse off as a result of the changes that he is proposing on royalties?

                    This is an extraordinary question when you consider that the Leader of the Opposition has come into this parliament and invited the states to put their royalties up. That is what he is on the record as doing: coming in here and recommending that states increase their royalties. What we will do is work with the states to get a satisfactory resolution that will grow the industry and provide a fair return to the Australian people.
