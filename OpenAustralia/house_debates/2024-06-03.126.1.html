        </a>
        's world-famous Eat Local Month. Distinguished Queenslanders, local residents and tourists from near and far will gather at more than 120 events with local producers across the beautiful Scenic Rim region for a month of celebrations. Some may ask: what is Eat Local Month? These 120 different events are an opportunity to showcase local products, whether it be beef, pork, cheese, honey, vegetables or fruit. Restaurants—from Brisbane and the south-east corner as well as from the

        —who procure products from our region take over a farm in the Scenic Rim where they buy product and showcase the product in conjunction with the people who grow and make the product and local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eat Local Month is now a cornerstone of our region's cultural calendar, and it's a testament to the resilience, creativity and passion of our local producers and the vibrant regional communities that support them. The Scenic Rim is a stunning landscape of rich, fertile valleys. It's a region blessed with a bounty of nature's gifts. Our local farmers, artisans and producers have long known the value of working in harmony with the land, cultivating produce and products that are second to none.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eat Local Month is an opportunity to showcase this exceptional produce, to celebrate the hard work and dedication that goes into every harvest and to bring the community together in appreciation of our local food heritage. There are local farm tours, cooking classes, food tasting and farmers' markets. There are countless opportunities to connect with the people who produce our food.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the events, which pulls in between 5,000 and 7,000 people, is when local carrot farmers open up their farms. Families bring their children, with their spades and their shovels, as if prepared to go to the beach, and they pick their own carrots and pull their own beans from the vines and then return to their homes having a better understanding of where their food comes from.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we choose to eat local, we are making a conscious decision to support our farmers and to ensure that the Scenic Rim continues to thrive for generations to come. This year I was particularly excited about the diverse array of events planned. It was a pleasure to attend the official launch a month ago with our local farmers and producers to showcase such a magnificent event, which rivals popular tourist destinations for food like

       </p>
       <p>
        From the vibrant Winter Harvest Festival, which is moving to Kalbar this year, to intimate farm-gate experiences, there's something for everyone to enjoy. This Saturday I will be attending the Kalbar-

        </a>
        Gourmet Country Long Lunch, hosted by the Kalbar Progress Association, something on the calendar that we try not to miss out on. It's a great opportunity to engage with not only celebrity chefs but local producers and people who travel to the region from Brisbane. And it's always a great afternoon to catch up with local residents from across the district.
       </p>
       <p>
        These events not only provide a platform for our producers to showcase their goods but also educate and inspire all of us to incorporate more local produce into our everyday lives. As the federal member for Wright, I am committed to supporting initiatives that bolster our economy and promote sustainable practices. I'm very proud of the fact that, when the Eat Local Month campaign started off, we were able to support the regional council with a couple of hundred thousand dollars to launch the project over a number of years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eat Local Month is a shining example of what we can achieve when we come together as a community. It's a celebration of our region's unique offerings and a reminder of the importance of supporting local businesses and our local agricultural sector. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of the organisers, volunteers and participants who make this program as popular as it is. Your dedicated hard work is truly commendable, and it's because of your efforts that Eat Local Month continues to grow and thrive each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I encourage each and every one of you to take full advantage of the events and activities that are on offer this month. Try something new, meet the faces behind the food and, most importantly, savour the incredible flavours of the Scenic Rim. To make your booking, visit eatlocalmonth.com.au. Together, let us celebrate eating local and the incredible community spirit that defines our beautiful region. You never know who you're going to sit next to at an Eat Local Month dinner.
