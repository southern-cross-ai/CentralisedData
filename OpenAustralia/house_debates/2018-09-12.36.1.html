        When politicians say racist things, it hurts. When politicians come to Melbourne and talk about African gangs, it hurts. When politicians say that they don't want Muslim people coming to this country, it hurts. When politicians talk about boat people or talk about migrants who come here as 'illegal', that hurts. It hurts especially in my community of Melbourne, where so many people come from so many different parts of the world. They say this is not what they want to hear.

        primary school in Fitzroy, a Catholic school just down the road from my street. They've been spending the year talking about harmony and how Australia should live in harmony and with multiculturalism. They've decided to take matters into their own hands. They want to promote a different version of Australia, one that I think we'd all agree with. They've taken a wonderful song, 'I am Australian', and added a few verses themselves. My singing is terrible, but, if you'll indulge me, Deputy Speaker, I'd like to get some of it on record. This is what the kids at Sacred Heart want to add to the song 'I am Australian':
