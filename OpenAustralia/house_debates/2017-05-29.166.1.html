        It gives me great pleasure to thank Jeff and Miriam Morgan of Jeff Morgan Gallery in Hawker in the central
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Ranges
        </a>
        for giving me the honour the last Friday of opening the latest addition to Jeff's art gallery. The latest addition is a panorama of the Arkaroola waterhole, Nooldoonooldoona, which is 46 metres around and 5½ metres high. It is a stunning piece of work. It joins Jeff's earlier Wilpena panorama and a number of huge canvases there, including the very popular 'Ron's Creek', which is 15 metres by 4½ metres high. Seriously, when looking at them, you feel as though you could walk into the Flinders Ranges. I actually say to people, 'The only downside of this gallery in Hawker is that people may well visit and then elect not to go into the rest of the Flinders Ranges because they have already seen it!' It is just so good. People cannot get enough of it.

        Jeff is held in high regard by the

        . In fact, when he visited China some years ago he was honoured with a very similar yellow coat to the one that

        wore when he was a special guest there. Jeff started training at 34. He was a house painter and he had an accident. He found then he could turn his skills to fine art. It is a great tribute to someone with great perseverance and skill—
