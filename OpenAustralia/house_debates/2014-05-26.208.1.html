        Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Andrews, it is wonderful to see you in the leadership position in that chair.
       </p>
       <p>
        All politics and no policy—Labor continues to spin a series of myths to score short-term political points to the detriment of all Australians. In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition said: 'Gone, $50 billion from hospital funding to states.' This is untrue. It is another of Labor's economic myths. The budget does not cut funding for health. Overall annual health spending will increase by more than $10 billion over the next four years. Spending from 2017-18 will be put on a sustainable footing, but will continue to grow every year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor Party currently have an online petition to save Medicare, as they allege it is under attack by the government. This also is untrue; it is another Labor myth. Ten years ago the Commonwealth was spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today it is spending $20 billion. The modest co-payment will ensure that Medicare is sustainable for future generations. In fact, it is the coalition, not the Labor Party, that is seeking to save Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor members constantly refer to pension cuts—another myth. The pension will not change during this term of parliament. It will continue to increase twice a year, as it always has. Even after the next election, pensions will continue to increase every year; however, they will continue to do so in line with the cost of living, not male average weekly earnings. The Labor Party is constantly full of misdirection and myth. They need to act in the national interest and in the best interest of all Australians.

         Bendigo welfare agencies and its not-for-profit sector are speaking out against the harsh cuts in Tony Abbott's first budget. Among those speaking out is Bendigo Community Health Services Chief Executive Officer Kim Sykes, who last week in a meeting of Bendigo welfare agencies said, 'There needs to be a rethink of any policy that further embeds disadvantage.' She went on to say, 'We seem to be driving this idea that if you're poor, or if you're without a job, if you're struggling, it must be your fault and your government will leave you in your own. We need to have a decent and civil society. We cannot allow society to be built around a concept that does not help those most vulnerable and most in need.' I agree with Kim. Kim raised her concerns regarding the federal budget during a meeting with Bendigo welfare groups last week. These groups are outraged and upset by the attacks this government has made on the people they spend every day working to care for and working to ensure that they are able to make ends meet. Included in this meeting of the Bendigo welfare agencies were Bendigo Community Health Services, the

         and Haven; Home, Safe as well as some Anglican and a number of other groups. They were there to support those most in need. I call on the government to listen to Kim's concerns and to come to Bendigo to meet with our welfare agencies. It is time that the government found the time to talk to those on the front line about how its budget is putting the poorest in our community—
