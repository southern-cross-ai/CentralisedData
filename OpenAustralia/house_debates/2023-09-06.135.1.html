        On 27 August I was privileged to attend the Hope Challenge at Loftberg Oval in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pymble" rel="nofollow">
         West Pymble
        </a>
        , an annual eight-hour game of touch football where registered players seek sponsorship for each hour that they play and raise money for the

         Black Dog Institute
        </a>
        , a leading mental health charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story behind the Hope Challenge is a moving one. In 2000, several dads at the West Pymble Public School with similar interests decided to organise a regular game of touch footy on a Sunday. One of the original group, Dr Rick Hope, was a much loved and respected doctor—a medical specialist. But Rick took his own life shortly after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The men who been regular players with him decided that it would be appropriate to organise an event that would honour Rick and that would raise money and awareness for mental health in his memory. The Hope Challenge is the result of their work, and it's a very appropriate way for Rick's mates to remember him. I was struck by the number of people attending and by the spirit amongst Rick's mates of determination to honour his memory but also to deliver constructive and practical support for the continuing challenge to address the risks that mental health disorders can present in our society. I want to thank participants and organisers, and particularly Phillip Ross, for their work.

        I want to acknowledge another important mental health cause in my electorate. Every year I join thousands of other residents in the Lindfield Fun Run. The course runs through the leafy streets of Lindfield—the leafy but surprisingly hilly streets of Linfield! Nevertheless, many people turn out at this event organised by Rotary, which supports
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYDS" rel="nofollow">
         KYDS

        , originally known as Ku-ring-gai Youth Services.
       </p>
       <p>
        KYDS is a remarkable organisation, founded with community support, which helps young people to understand and manage difficult issues in their lives, including: grief, loss, family breakups, school and study stress and so on. Last year, KYDS provided almost 6,000 face-to-face individual and family counselling sessions and supported over 400 families, and they reached an additional 3,000 students, parents, carers and other family members through their school and community outreach program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every community across Australia, of course, is affected by mental health challenges. I want to acknowledge the work of so many good people in my electorate through these two particular causes that I've mentioned in responding to the challenge of mental health and providing support to those who need it.
