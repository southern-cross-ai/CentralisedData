        Primary School celebrated its centenary. For months the staff planned a range of events to celebrate its long history. The events included an art exhibition and an evening party hosted by actor, author and former school parent

        . It is a place with a real sense of community, and the celebrations brought generations of families back to the school grounds. Past students, some of whom graduated decades ago, came to share their stories and old photographs of their time in primary school. Those photographs have now been put up on the school's website for all to enjoy. There was even a Facebook page set up for past students who could not attend the celebrations to post their favourite stories of primary school, from Easter hat parades to billy cart races and watermelon days in the summer. Many of these past students have also seen their children and grandchildren graduate from Footscray West Primary School. It is an august institution, one that has even educated one of my predecessors in this place, the former member for Gellibrand the Hon.

        . Our Future' policy. It is a policy that will enable schools like Footscray West primary to continue to deliver quality education to people in Melbourne's west for many years to come. It was a pleasure not only to be welcomed by the school staff but also by the fantastic kids, who wanted to impress us and show off their school. Congratulations Footscray West Primary School on your centenary, and I look forward to watching the school's work for many years to come.
