        men. It's delivered through an Australian rules football academy. Newton Moore's Clontarf academy opened in 2007 and has grown in leaps and bounds. In its inaugural year, 41 students graduated. Over 500 students have graduated from the school since its inception. It's a great result. Eighty per cent of the graduates have gone on to employment and further education within their first year out of the school. The majority who've studied at the academy are now working, starting their own families and buying their own homes. In 2013, the academy started yearly health checks, and now over 230 young Indigenous men have had health checks.

        Full credit must be given to the team who lead and inspire these young men, led by director, Boyd Davey, and regional manager, Michael Lay. Boyd, Michael and their team are delivering great results in the south-west. There are currently more than 60 students enrolled at the school this year. I congratulate all of the staff and the principal, Susan Kerr, at Newton Moore Senior High Schoolâ€”all of the leadership group. I commend the great work of Newton Moore's Clontarf academy. I commend the young men who are part of this course and in education and leadership.
