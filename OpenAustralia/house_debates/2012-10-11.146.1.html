        Mr Second Deputy Speaker Georganas, I congratulate you on your new position. I seek leave to table a letter I received from a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        constituent last night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you. The letter I received was from Mrs Vicki Mayne from the Annaburroo station asking if I could read her letter in parliament. As we only have three minutes I will only read certain parts. She says:

        If you truly care about the welfare of animals destined for export than please, please read my message and then take the time to think long and hard about the bigger picture to this debate. If you think my words are a waste of breath, than think of this—I had coffee with a mustering pilot yesterday who said he has clients who are unable to pay their bills knowing that they have to continue with mustering for the welfare of their cows and calves, and that one gentleman feels that despondent that he has contemplated suicide.

         Live Export
        </a>
        Industry not only involves the welfare of animals but human life too—why are people not understanding the impact this is having on OUR livestock here in Australia, Australian Families, and the thousands and thousands of Indonesian Families already affected by a temporary ban in trade by a rash decision made by our current Government influenced by the Greens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yes we, Australian Graziers, do care and are quite concerned about the welfare of animals that have been exported to other countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But ask yourself this—if Australia turns their back on Live Export what other country will continue Australia's effort to ensure the welfare of animals exported from other countries?

        are pushing ahead in Federal Parliament to ban live export. I ask this question, if the Government and people of Australia push forward with a Live Export ban what will happen to the welfare of over a millions cattle and sheep here in Australia and what will happen to families involved? Are Australians happy to watch cattle and sheep die of a slow painful death as they starve due to overstocking of their paddocks because the Government decides to close the door on Live Export? And are Australians happy to watch on as our Australian Graziers take their own life because they are so ashamed that they cannot provide fodder and water for their livestock or financial support for their families. Have people forgotten about the Beef Depression in the 1970s which affected 100s of grazing families and their communities in
