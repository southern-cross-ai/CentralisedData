        Last Sunday, 9 September, I attended the presentation day of the Hurstville City Minotaurs at Kingsgrove
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Club. Kingsgrove RSL has supported the Minotaurs for many years now, and it was great to be there at the presentation day. The parents were able to make use of the club facilities, with a park next door where the kids could run around and enjoy themselves. The Minotaurs are a great club. They've been around for more than 30 years and they have, it's fair to say, an inspirational leader in Peter Sarikakis, who has been involved in the club for many years and who, along with his wife, puts an enormous amount of energy into the club, as do all the other members of the committee. It was great to see so many kids acknowledged on the day and it was terrific to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards. I look forward to continuing to support the Minotaurs in the future.

        On 8 September Oatley Public School held its centenary dinner at Doltone House. It was a very special occasion: 100 years of quality education at Oatley Public School. I'd like to thank Debbie Hunter, the Principal of Oatley Public School, for the leadership that she provides. It was good on the night to hear from Rodger Robertson, of the Oatley Heritage &amp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Historical Society
        </a>
        , about the history of the school, its very humble origins back in 1917 and what it has grown to today. The Oatley historical society does tremendous work in preserving the history of our area. I'd also like to congratulate the P&amp;C president, Sandy Grekas, on her work in organising what was a very large and successful function. Congratulations to Oatley Public School.

        I want to take a moment in the House to express my support for the people of Bangladesh who have been affected by the devastating floods over the past month. In Bangladesh alone around eight million people have been affected by the floods, as indeed have livestock and businesses in that country. Well over 1,000 people have been killed by the floods and, sadly, there are a significant number of people still unaccounted for. In my electorate of Banks we have a growing and vibrant Bangladeshi community, who make a great contribution to our area. Now, as the floodwaters have receded and the clean-up continues, the focus moves to repairing what has been lost and preventing the spread of disease. To the Australian Bangladeshi community, in particular the Bangladeshi community in the electorate of Banks, I pass on my best wishes and support at this time.
