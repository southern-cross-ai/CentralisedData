       <p>
        I rise to speak about one of the great privileges that comes with being a member of parliament. This week I have had the opportunity to host a number of schools from my electorate of Barker while they visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . It is always a privilege, of course, to welcome any constituent to this place, but it is especially rewarding to welcome students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the week I have had the pleasure of meeting hundreds of children from across Barker as another generation makes the annual visit to Canberra—the same trip I myself made in 1989. I have been particularly impressed by their knowledge of civics and citizenship—an area I am obviously passionate about.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week has been one of reflection as well as of learning for those students. I was honoured to mark this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at the

        </a>
        with some of the students. I commend the students of St Anthony's from Millicent and the students of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Martins" rel="nofollow">
         St Martins
        </a>
        and of

        from my home town of

        for their exemplary conduct at the ceremony. In the face of some pretty poor weather they did themselves proud. I would also like to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Monash Primary School
        </a>
        from the Riverland, Keyneton Primary from the

         Barossa Valley
        </a>
        and Palmer Primary from Palmer for taking the time to catch up with me while they toured the house. It is, of course, a great tonic for homesickness.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all of the schools, I commend your students for their excellent behaviour and for their engagement. They are a credit to their schools and to the electorate more generally. It is through investing in our children and passing on our democratic traditions that we ensure the future of this nation. If the children of Barker are any indication of what is to come, then the future of this nation—
