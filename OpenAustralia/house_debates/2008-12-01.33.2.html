        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his 2007 election commitment, and I quote the Digital Education Revolution policy document, which says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... to provide a computer on the desk of every upper secondary school student ...

         Our commitment on this has not changed. Our commitment as part of the digital education revolution is to ensure that our kids are equipped for the challenges of the 21st century. That is why we put $1.2 billion out there for this program. That is why in discussions with the states and territories on Saturday we committed a further $800 million to this program. Do you know why? We want to get it done. We want every kid in the country to have proper access to computers.

          I would say to those opposite as they engage in partisan short-term politics on this: put up your hand those of you who do not want computers delivered to the classrooms in your electorate.

              Order! The member for Moncrieff knows that that was not a point of order. I will warn certain people who tend to think that they can give me advice at the drop of a penny—those on my right as well. The member for Moncrieff knows that that was not a point of order. He should be very careful in future.

               This government is proud of the computer revolution in Australian schools and this government is proud of the education revolution in Australian schools. This government wants to make sure that our kids are equipped with the skills necessary for the 21st century. Already the practical work is being done. In round 1, 946 schools from across Australia have been invited to submit an application—these were schools with a student-to-computer ratio of one to eight or worse, identified through the national audit. Round 1 provided funding of $116 million to 896 schools. Would those opposite who have benefited from round 1 put up their hands if they would not like this funding to be delivered? No, they are not so keen on that. That is $116 million in funding for schools. That is actually a pretty good start and 16,000 computers are expected to be delivered by 31 December to 186 schools across Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Round 2 of the fund has recently closed and a total of 1,420 schools across Australia applied—793 government schools, 342 independent schools and 285 Catholic schools. This government is proud of this program. It is equipping Australia and our kids for the future. It is an education revolution in the classroom to make sure they can compete in the world economy of the 21st century.
