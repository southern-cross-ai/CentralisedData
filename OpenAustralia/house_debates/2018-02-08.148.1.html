        I want to quickly talk about the success of the PaTH program for young people and encourage members in this place to embrace it in their electorates. I recently got a letter from Nicola Saad in my electorate. She is a parent of young adults, and she has seen firsthand how difficult it can be to break into the job market as the number of entry-level jobs is drying up. She says, 'We have one child who graduated high school with a diploma in business. Another has done a diploma in floristry at

        , applies for hundreds of jobs per week and has got nowhere. It can be incredibly disheartening for young people.' I understand. I remember, years ago when I wanted to be a sales executive, I applied for probably 50 to 80 jobs before I landed a job as a sales executive with Sony Australia. I was terribly disappointed when I went for jobs: I knew I was a great applicant, but I wasn't landing them. With persistence I got there and went on to do great things there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to talk quickly about the PaTH program because I feel it's a really good program for people that are unemployed, young people aged between 18 and 24. Last week I met with participants in the prepare phase from local training organisation Designer Life in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . They're doing great things with these young people. Participants were writing cover letters for jobs. They were doing a three-week course where they learned how to write a resume. They learnt about interviewing techniques and other important skills to help them become employable. I had the chance to address them and to chat with them quickly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next phase is the trial, where the participants spend some four to 12 weeks in a business. The PaTH program, for the first time, gives young people the opportunity to work in the private sector, mix with other people that are wearing a uniform, have

        s and turn up to work on time. That rubs off on them. I was at a place last week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PR" rel="nofollow">
         PR
        </a>
        Cleaning Rags, a Clontarf business run by Mr and Mrs Enfield, and met a young woman there, Gillian Dawes from Margate. She was a lovely young woman. Gillian was in her 20s; she had been unemployed; she now has a full-time job with PR Cleaning Rags. There was another young woman, Emma, who had been with that company for a few years, who was mentoring her as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a really good program. In Petrie we have had about 285 people placed. Actually only 50 completed the trial, but 164 have been hired. When I dug a bit deeper as to why only 50 had completed the trial, they told me that businesses had put them on for a few weeks and said, 'They're pretty good; let's offer them a job straightaway.' So much for taking advantage of them, as some members have said that this program would encourage. I want to encourage businesses in everyone's electorate to look at the PaTH program and find a young person you can mentor and train. And I want to encourage young people to get into it. There are great opportunities for you, and this is a good way to kick off your career and get some experience.
