        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the eighth report of the committee for 2008 relating to the proposed Australian Super Hornet facilities project,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The committee’s eighth report of 2008,
        <i>
         Australian Super Hornet facilities project
        </i>
        , addresses the Australian Super Hornet facilities project,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        , Queensland, valued at $117.1 million, referred to the committee by this House on 28 May 2008. The proposal will expand and modify facilities and infrastructure to support No. 82 Wing’s No 1 Squadron, No. 6 Squadron and No. 278 Squadron in their transition from the F111 to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
         FA
        </a>
        18F Super Hornets.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the inquiry, the committee assured itself that the proposed facilities would cater not only to the FA18F aircraft but also to any future aircraft introduced to the Australian fleet to ensure that this building work has a multifunctional and long-term use. While a number of issues were raised with the committee, it has reported on an exception-only basis on issues that it though warranted further comment. I would urge those interested in this work to supplement the report, with the transcripts and submissions being available on the committee’s website.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local residents raised concerns about the impact on other developments within RAAF Base Amberley. While they were not strictly relevant to this project, they are important and I urge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        to continue an open and transparent consultation process on base changes with the local community. The committee has recommended that the House resolve that the works be carried out. I would like to thank the members and senators on the committee for their work in relation to this inquiry and I commend the report to the House.
