       <p class="italic">
        (c) this year's Summit will focus on debate on Australia's next National Strategic Plan to eliminate asbestos nationwide;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Agency has raised concerns over workplace safety following the 100 workers who were exposed to asbestos while working on the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) it is unclear how many further building sites across Australia contain asbestos or how many workers are unknowingly exposed to asbestos each day; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Agency advised the Senate Economics References Committee's inquiry into non-conforming building products that building products containing asbestos are being imported to Australia contrary to Australian law;

       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia has one of the highest rates of asbestos related deaths and injury in the world, with 33,000 people already having lost their lives to asbestos;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) around 700 Australians die each year from asbestos related diseases, and without proper management experts worry that tens of thousands of Australians could be diagnosed with asbestos related diseases in the coming decades; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) experts believe that 20,000 to 25,000 Australians will die from asbestos or asbestos related illnesses before the end of this century;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) condemns the Government's inaction and silence on the dangers of asbestos, despite warnings provided to the Senate inquiry; and

       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) give greater importance to stopping asbestos importers at the border and immediately increase the penalties for illegal asbestos contamination on Australian building sites; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) create greater transparency and accountability between the Australian Border Force and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in their dealings with asbestos related importations.
