         I'd like to thank the member for Corangamite for her very good question and for the fact she's been a strong advocate for skills. We had a wonderful roundtable in her electorate, talking to local businesses about how we can supply skills locally.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having inherited a massive skills shortage, we promised to respond accordingly. It's why we convened the Jobs and Skills Summit. It's why we announced the 180,000 fee-free
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
          VET
         </a>
         places for 2023. It's why we've established Jobs and Skills Australia. It's of course why we struck eight agreements with state and territory governments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many people in this place, certainly on this side, fully understand the transformative power of education and training. We understand it for individuals and we understand the impact on the nation if we can invest in skills wisely, and of course that's what we look to do. And it's more important now than ever before. Nine out of every 10 jobs created in our economy require a university degree—which of course Minister Clare would fully understand—or a VET qualification. That's what we know. It's essential therefore that we remove barriers to education and training, and one of the barriers to education and training is cost. That's why we invested in 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places—to provide access to areas of skills that are in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other reason we need to invest in skills is that, if we invest in skills that are in demand, we have a more productive and more efficient workforce. That's the reality. That's why it's so baffling that those opposite oppose this plan. If we are to rewire the nation and fulfil the Powering Australia plan, then we need to ensure that we invest in skills. If we're going to get the absolute maximum out of the National Reconstruction Fund, then we need to invest in skills. If we're going to look after older Australians and teach preschool kids, we have to invest in skills, and that's we've chosen to do. We need to do that because we need to be a better economy. If we invest in manufacturing, we're going to deal with the supply chain problems that the member asked about.
        </p>
        <p>
         These things matter. That's why our plans are being supported by

         and by many, many others. It really begs the question: why do those opposite oppose a plan that is good for workers, that is good for businesses, that is good for consumers and that is critical for this nation's future?
