        I rise to congratulate several young achievers from my seat of Banks. It is well-known that our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        network is an essential public institution and one which the government values highly. TAFE is on the front line when it comes to giving Australians the skills they need to get a job and to secure their future. We are experiencing an unprecedented demand for skills as the resources and construction industries boom. Our workforce is shrinking and we need to encourage greater participation from those who are not currently engaged in work. The nature of work itself is changing due to the impact of rapid technological change. We are seeing high-skilled jobs grow at 2.5 times the rate of other jobs. Skills Australia forecast that we will need an additional 2.4 million people within the workforce with qualifications at Certificate III or higher by 2015. To meet industry demand, that figure will rise to 5.2 million by 2025. As the oldest, the biggest and the most respected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        provider in Australia, TAFE plays a central role in the development of our future workforce. TAFE not only has a proud place in Australia's economic history as a source of skills and social mobility for millions of people, it has a pivotal role to play in Australia's economic future.

        Locally, Bankstown, Padstow and St George TAFE campuses service the needs of the constituents of Banks. Recently, federal funding of $406,446 has been provided to Padstow for wireless and voice over internet protocol, maintenance, customer service facilities and environmental facilities. Bankstown has received $762,146 for upgrade, refurbishment and maintenance. St George received $1,323,479 for refurbishment and maintenance.

        On 6 June I attended the South Western Sydney Institute high achievers award ceremony. This is the institute's premier event of the year and acknowledges the outstanding achievements of both students and staff. It showcases the high standards of teaching and learning through staff and student success stories. This year those students included Kogulan Baskaran from Padstow TAFE, who received a TAFE

        State Medal. TAFE NSW State Medals are awarded to those students who have achieved first place in their course across all TAFE institutes in

        . Kogulan graduated with a Diploma of

        ). In his comments on his award, he noted that he was fortunate to have dedicated teachers who helped set him on the path to achieving his goal of becoming an engineer.

        Josephine Stefani also received a TAFE medal on her graduation with a Diploma of Information Technology (Website Development). Josephine also commented on the quality of the teachers who assisted her develop her skills and experience in her chosen career.

        Katarina Marcok received a Certificate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Floristry from Padstow TAFE. She was recognised with the award in the School of Tourism, Hospitality, Industry and Arts. This award was recognition of her outstanding achievement in her area of study and her contribution to college life and her community. Katarina also acknowledged the contribution of her teachers, not only in the quality of teaching but in the guidance and support they provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of these students is testament to their hard work and commitment. Further, the recognition of the students reflects the professionalism and dedication of their teachers and the staff of their TAFE. I congratulate those students and also acknowledge the support they receive from their families and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal level, four members of my family were educated through the TAFE system. They were fortunate in that they had dedicated teachers as well. I had an interaction with TAFE dating back to the 1980s; I was on the then College Committee of Bankstown TAFE. On every occasion on which I have had something to do with TAFE, I have always been gobsmacked by the enthusiasm, dedication and commitment of the teachers. That is where the success of TAFE comes from: the teaching community. I want to commend those teachers who assisted these students achieve as well as they have.
