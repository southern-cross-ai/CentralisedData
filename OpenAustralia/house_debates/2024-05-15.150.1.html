        On 25 April we gathered across Australia to honour the spirit of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzacs" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is a day etched into the fabric of our collective memoryâ€”a day of remembrance, reflection and reverence for the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of the

        </a>
        . As we stand here united, we pay homage to those who courageously defended our freedom, our democracy and our way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the morning of Anzac Day I had the privilege of attending the dawn service organised by the Hampton Park Progress Association. This service, borne out of a small group of passionate community members, has blossomed into a moving tribute to our fallen heroes. The dawn service commemorates the stand-to in which troops would be woken so that by the first rays of dawn they were in position in case of an enemy attack. The service was imbued with poetry, speeches from esteemed community leaders and a heartfelt stand-to by our local cadets. I was deeply moved to sing our national anthem and recite the ode, honouring the sacrifices of those who have gone before us.
       </p>
       <p>
        I later joined the midday service hosted by the Dandenong-Cranbourne
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The parade down High Street Cranbourne was a steering display of unity, with banners held high by representatives from across our community. It was heartening to witness the presence of so many young faces from across my electorate, standing shoulder to shoulder with us in remembrance. Their participation underscores the enduring significance of Anzac Day, ensuring that the torch of remembrance is passed on to future generations, for it is through their understanding and appreciation that we ensure the sacrifices of our fallen heroes are never forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        I concluded Anzac Day in the southern reaches of my electorate, in Tooradin, on the invitation of Tooradin football club and Warrant Officer Cameron Devenny of

        . Here, amidst the echoes of artillery and the solemn ranks of military personnel, the crowd at Tooradin football club reaffirmed our commitment to honouring the legacy of our

        s. Anzac Day is only one day of the year, but let us carry forward the ANZAC spirit in our hearts, cherishing the values of courage, mateship and sacrifice. Lest we forget.
