        Today I would like to congratulate the recipients of the Order of Australia awards in the 2019
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        honours within my electorate of Boothby. I am honoured to be able to congratulate this year's recipients and to recognise their contributions to our community. I acknowledge the following residents for their outstanding service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Tara Brabazon was made a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her significant service to education, particularly to graduate and cultural studies. Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         David Gray
        </a>
        was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to veterans and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Ian Wall
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was made a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the community. I've been fortunate to know Ian Wall and his wife, Pam, for some time. They are a wonderful team, and they support so many charities and causes in South Australia and further afield and do so with great generosity. Sincere congratulations to both Ian and Pam.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise Anthony Favretto and Jo-Anna Kenney, who were awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The following local residents were awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in the 2019 Australia Day honours: Mrs Carol Boyle, for service to lawn bowls; Mr Peter Kemp, for service to baseball; Mr John Kenny, for service to the community; Mrs Glenda Bailey, for service to the community of South Australia; and Mr Geoffrey Thomas, for service to primary industry. Geoff has also worked tirelessly to raise funds for research into and awareness of motor neurone disease, which took the life of his wife, Mary, very cruelly and tragically, and I know that Mary would have been so proud of Geoff receiving this award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these honours recipients is a dedicated and respected member of our community. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to each and every one of them for all they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take this opportunity to recognise Mr Stanley Evans, who was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of South Australia
        </a>
        . Stan and his wonderful wife, Barbara, have been great friends and supporters of mine as the member for Boothby and of so many others in our Liberal family, and I was delighted to see Stan awarded this honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        My local councils also recognised local volunteers at ceremonies on Australia Day, and I would like to congratulate the following recipients: City of Mitcham Citizen of the Year Mr Ian Steel; City of Marion Citizen of the Year Ms Emilie Ripinskis, Young Citizen of the Year Ms Chelsea Long, Sports Team of the Year Marion Football Club and Event of the Year Marion Markets; City of Holdfast Bay Citizen of the Year Mr Brian Bayliss, Young Citizen of the Year Mr Zel Whiting, Local Hero Mr Leslie Tucker, Community Recognition Award winner Ms Alyssa West and Event of the Year Glenelg Community Centre Seniors Lunch. Thank you to all of these residents and groups for the contribution they make to our community.
