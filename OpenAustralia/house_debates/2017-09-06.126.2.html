       <p>
        The first thing I would like to talk about is who we represent. I just heard the member for Lalor speak about those who are doing it hard. Those who are doing it hard around my area, especially in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe Valley
        </a>
        , are those people who have lost their jobs because of the closure of Hazelwood. They're doing it hard. And I'm their representative. I represent those people who are doing it tough out in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second part about the closure of Hazelwood was the production price of electricity. Because of the closure, it has gone from $35 to $40 a megawatt to nearly $100 a megawatt. The competition that Hazelwood produced—27 per cent of Victoria's power; some three or four per cent of Australia's power—was removed immediately. So the competition was taken away. And, in my view, we've been gouged by electricity companies, which are making enormous profits.
       </p>
       <p>
        My concern, though, is for the people that have had their power turned off or their gas turned off, or any utility turned off, or who are actually, in this case, going to relatives to borrow money to pay their bills. It's a call tonight to people from Lalor to Lilydale and to Longwarry, from Perth to Parramatta and from Cairns to Cygnet: if you're doing it hard tell your representative that you're doing it hard. Tell your local member exactly what's happening in your household. I heard from a nurse today who is on casual rates. When she doesn't work, she doesn't get paid. She's got two kids at uni. She had to go to her sister, who she doesn't like very much, and ask to borrow some money to pay her electricity bill so the house could keep working. For all those people out there who have had their electricity turned off and who are using gas burners and other arrangements to get through this winter, I know you're out there. But I can tell you something: your local member doesn't. And it's time. I have to listen to my community—right across this nation. I want to hear how you are doing it, because your members need to know.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know the world that I live in, and it's not the world that you live in. I know you're doing it hard and that because of your pride you're not telling anybody. You're just getting through. Well, this is a wealthy nation. You need to be cared for, and we are your representatives to do exactly that. We are representatives of the people of this nation, whichever party we represent and whether it's local, federal or state. If you're doing it hard, I'm calling out to you tonight: tell your local member. If they don't know, they can't act on your behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whatever is happening in the utilities across this nation, we are the wealthiest nation when it comes to natural resources. Because of the policies that have been imposed at a state and federal level over a long period of time, we now find ourselves in one mess that is not delivering on behalf of those that need us most. They need us as elected representatives to represent them on a daily basis and to think about how you who are doing it hard. I know you're working. But I know you're not being able to meet your bills. There are too many across this country who are just putting up with the problem and saying nothing. And I know another thing: I know you're angry, I know you feel alone and I know you feel unloved. Well, that's not the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I appeal to you tonight: write a note, make a phone call, send an email. It's a call to you to tell your local member so we can act on your behalf. I know the criticisms of Centrelink. So tell us so that we can tell them, so that we can tell our executives, and so that we can help. Because that's what we're here for. We're elected by you to represent you in this place. And we do represent you. We represent all of the people of Australia. The 150 people in this parliament represent this nation. And we want to hear from you. I want to hear from you from my area, too. And so does every other member of parliament.
