        On 8 June, 75 years ago, Sydney came under direct attack for the second time in its history. Eight days earlier, three Japanese midget subs had entered
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">

        , firing a torpedo which hit

        and killed 21 sailors. On that 8 June of 75 years ago, at exactly 0015 hours, the 102-metre long Japanese submarine I-24 surfaced about four miles off the Sydney coast. The submarine had previously participated in the attack on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and in the Battle of the

        . The submarine opened fire with its deck gun on the sleeping city of Sydney. It fired 10 shells. Six of the shells failed to explode, and the other four caused minor damage to houses.

        At Bankstown airfield, Lieutenant George Leo Cantello of the

        Air Force's 41st fighter squadron received a call that Sydney was under attack. The 27-year-old was the only pilot at that time stationed at Bankstown airfield. He took off just after midnight into the sky alone, facing attackers unknown. His plane climbed to 1,000 feet, where, tragically, the aircraft's engine failed. He plummeted into the ground and crashed in a ball of flames at Hammondville about five kilometres south-west of banks and the field.

        , a young boy who lived at Hammondville, witnessed the crash and saw the aftermath. John has fought for decades to ensure that Lieutenant Cantello is recognised as a true hero. Last week, we were most fortunate—I congratulate Liverpool council for organising a most moving ceremony—to recognise the great sacrifice that Lieutenant Cantello, an American, made to protect our city of Sydney.

        The I-24 finally met its fate when it was depth charged and rammed, and sank with all hands—104 officers and men—by the

        28 Japanese and German submarines operated in Australian weapons. They sank 30 ships, killing 654 people, including 200 merchant seamen.

        Lieutenant Cantello was an American of Italian descent. He came to Australia to protect our nation. He gave his life in the protection of Sydney. We will always remember him. Lest we forget.
