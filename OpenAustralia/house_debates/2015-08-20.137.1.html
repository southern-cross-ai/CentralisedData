       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to a great Canberran, Eric Traise. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge members of Eric's family who are sitting with us in the chamber, his wife, and members from the Tuggeranong Community Council. He was a very much loved member of the Canberra community, and today's presence of so many friends and colleagues highlights that. I welcome them to the chamber today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only was Eric a great Canberran but he was also a very active member of the Tuggeranong community and, as I said, he was a much loved member of the Tuggeranong community. He was dedicated to improving our community and working tirelessly to make Tuggeranong and Canberra a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric was born in Newcastle and was the youngest of five children. He attended Newcastle High and then joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        as an engineering cadet after high school. He was posted to Malaysia and then later to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        . He had a fabulous 21-year career in the military. Eric later worked with what is now
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and

        </a>
        , where he upgraded and maintained radars. This work led to a love of radars and a love, I understand, of taking photos of radars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric and his wife, Carole, moved to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to retire but were brought back to Canberra when they learned they were going to be grandparents. During his retirement, I found out the other day, Eric found Winny. Eric was crazy about Winny. Winny had a strange effect on Eric and his wife. He loved Winny. Carole, I think, hated Winny. By the way, Winny was a Winnebago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later on in his life, Eric served on the Tuggeranong Community Council for many years as a general member, as a treasurer and as president in 2013, and, despite his illness, he stood and was re-elected for a second term in September 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate enough to hear about Eric's life at a memorial service last Friday at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
         ANU
        </a>
        . It was heart-warming to see hundreds of people turn out for the service, but it was not surprising, because he had such respect from the Canberra community and a positive influence on so many Canberrans. I noted some of the ways that people described Eric and I want to recount those today: 'He was truly one of a kind.' 'He firmly believed in living a life that matters.' 'He was a patient and understanding parent.' 'No problem was insurmountable.' 'He was a man of integrity.' 'He set high standards.' 'He added value to everything he did.' 'Everyone turned to him in their time of need.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Eric made an enormous contribution to Canberra and his legacy will live on in so many ways. I send my deepest condolences to his family: his wife, Carole; his children, Melinda, Sheriden and Matthew and his grandchildren, Matthew, Riley and Myah. He will be greatly missed. May he rest in peace. Vale Eric Traise.
