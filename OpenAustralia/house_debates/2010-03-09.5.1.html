       <p>
        On indulgence, as members would be aware, Queensland has been experiencing significant flooding across the state. Fifty-eight local government areas in Queensland have been declared disaster areas following tropical cyclone Neville in January and tropical cyclone Olga in February. Some areas in Queensland have been in flood for many weeks. Our thoughts are with Queenslanders faced with flooding, including those members of the House and Senate with properties, and loved ones living in these areas, as well. At the moment the impact is particularly severe in the south-west of the state. Over the weekend I spoke with many mayors from the south-west of the state and they gave me their direct feedback on what was happening on the ground and the extra services and support they may need now and into the future. They spoke directly about the devastation of their towns and shires and also of the great stoicism of their local communities. Between 300 and 400 houses in Charleville remain affected by water; however, people are now returning home after being housed at the local evacuation centre. About 200 houses in Roma were affected by water above flood level. All roads to Thargomindah are currently cut and are expected to remain so for the rest of the month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meandarra, the town isolated by extensive floodwaters, has 16 houses and five businesses which have experienced internal floodingâ€”about 50 per cent of the town. The Special Minister of State and the Minister for Human Services are today touring the area of south-west Queensland affected by the floodwaters, including Charleville and St George. As I indicated to the House before, the member for Maranoa, I understand, is with them. While the floodwaters are starting to recede in some areas of Queensland this means recovery efforts need to start.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        is providing a range of assistance to Queensland to assist with relief and recovery efforts. This includes, under the Commonwealth and state Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, assistance to 58 government areas. Depending on the local government area, the range of assistance comprises personal hardship and distress grants, concessional loans, freight subsidies, counterdisaster operations and restoration of essential public assets assistance also to affected local government areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has also activated the Australian government disaster recovery payment in a number of local government areas. Furthermore, in response to a request from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Queensland
        </a>
        , I have also agreed to additional assistance for affected primary producers and small businesses. That assistance, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, will comprise clean-up and recovery grants to small businesses and primary producers to the value of up to $5,000 for tier 1 grants and $20,000 for tier 2 grants. The assistance will be provided under category C of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. On behalf of all members, I say to those who are currently facing the massive clean-up in south-west Queensland that our thoughts are with you. To those who are about to bear the brunt of these floodwaters, I urge you to follow the advice of state government and local emergency services personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commonwealth will continue to work closely with the Queensland authorities, local government and community organisations to ensure all affected communities have the assistance they need. I am sure all members of the House will join me in expressing our thoughts and solidarity with the people of south-west Queensland today, as they are affected by these floods. Having spoken to so many of these mayors over the weekend it is plain that the locals are bearing up very well under the pressures they face. There is nothing like the stoicism of the local communities in and around these towns of south-western Queensland who have experienced floods many times before. They are deploying again the stoicism and the resolve that we have seen in dealing with these challenges today.

        <p>
         On behalf of the opposition, I join with the Prime Minister in acknowledging the situation in southern Queensland. I thank the Prime Minister for the good work of his ministers and that of various officials of various governments in dealing with this emergency. I can inform the House that the member for Maranoa, who is absent today, has been keeping me regularly updated with developments, as has Senator Barnaby Joyce who, as members would know, is a resident of St George, one of the most affected townships.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister has indicated, events like this are very traumatic for residents, but we admire the stoicism with which they have met this challenge. Obviously, events like this are very challenging for our emergency services personnel, but again we admire the professionalism with which they have met this challenge, as they have met so many other challenges in the past. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the people of south-eastern Queensland and they should know that the whole of this parliament will support them and help them as they deal with these difficult days.
