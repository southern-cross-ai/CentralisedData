        </a>
        in Parliament program asked, 'So, what do you want Australia to look like in 20 years?' and many young Goldstein residents answered to the call. All contributions were excellent, but two speeches stood out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is by 14-year-old Ava Minovski, and it shares my commitments to national ambition. She wrote: 'Most recently Australian states and territories have been faced with immense disruption caused by a global pandemic. These events have had an profound impact on all Australians. They have challenged the decision-making and debate of our government and tested our nation's strength and resolve. Winston Churchill once said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. As we look towards our future, we must keep this idea in mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Today, through the foundations of our democracy, we continue to address social and economic inequities. If this global pandemic has shown us anything, it has exemplified what we can achieve should we work together for the greater good of our Commonwealth. I can't imagine the challenges Australia will face 20 years from now, but my hope is that the strength of our democracy sustains with visionary leaders who reflect on past choices and decisions that have succeeded and failed in order to steer this great nation with its diverse people to be stronger, behaver and smarter. Twenty years from now I hope to see all Australians embarking on endeavours that are bold enough to benefit generations to come.' Congratulations, Ava.
       </p>

        The second is by 21-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Webster" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Webster
        </a>
        and delves into the importance of freedom: 'In 20 years Australia will be the free country it once was. The COVID-19 pandemic has been tough on every person and every facet of life. Unfortunately, the collateral of this pandemic has been our civil liberties. It has highlighted the flaws in our state system which has cost and will keep costing billions of dollars. In 20 years we should be able to go about our lives without arbitrary laws dictating our every move. I believe over the past two decades, and especially since 2020, Australia, and Victoria in particular, has become more and more of a nanny state. Regardless of the pandemic there are too many laws which impinge on our very freedom, from local government all the way up to federal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        'In 20 years Australia should go back to the free place it once was, without fear of being cancelled or hated on for not being 100 per cent politically correct. In 20 years Australia should be a free market with a thriving economy, as it once was. That is what I want Australia to be like in 20 years time.' And outstanding contribution, Chris. I also thank the other entrants: Jenson Galvin, Nicholas Alexopoulos, Cassie Barker, Christina Cushen, Shari Holden, Anya Hunt, Lili Mayer, Rand Riman, Isla Rood,

        , Martha Stamatopoulos, Thomas Stamp and Chris Webster. All were outstanding contributions and I'm sorry we didn't have the chance to read them all into the
        <i>

        . But, hopefully, your name and recognition honours your contribution. Of course, we encourage other participants to contribute to this great project and define the future of our country to come.
