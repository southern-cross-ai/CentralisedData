        Today I had the great pleasure of joining the Leader of the Opposition at the

        Tuggeranong bus depot to discuss Labor's plans for apprentices and building the trade skills of the future. It was the second time that the opposition leader and I had been to the depot. The first was in 2015 with my dear friend and colleague the former shadow minister for vocational education, the member for Cunningham. Back then we discussed how Labor's trade training centres were providing a pathway to apprenticeships.

        One of the highlights of today was meeting 16-year-old Renee. Renee completed year 10 at St Mary MacKillop College last year and chose to do her work experience at the bus depot.

        recently, the opposition leader underscored Labor's commitment to trades and vocational education. Labor has a plan for apprenticeships, skills and vocational education, unlike the Turnbull government, which has cut 130,000 apprenticeships and sees trade and vocational education as second class.
