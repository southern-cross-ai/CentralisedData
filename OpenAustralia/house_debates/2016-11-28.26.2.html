        We know that there was corruption. What we do not know yet is how many of them were involved. We do not yet know how many of them were involved, but as you go through the evidence that has been provided already representative after representative, minister after minister have their fingerprints all over this. At the core of what we are talking about is a Liberal government pretending that $300 million of taxpayers money is their personal piggy bank, as though they are allowed to just dole out taxpayers money to any Liberal government they so choose.

             The member for Isaacs will resume his seat. I caution the member for Isaacs. I asked him to resume his seat. He continued to debate the matter without his microphone being on. Not only is it pointless; it is in defiance of the chair. Let me just say that, through the course of this week, it will not happen again. The question is that the member for Isaacs be no longer heard.
