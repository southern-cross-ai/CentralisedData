       <p>
        Twenty-one August marked a special milestone for me: 10 consecutive years as the federal member for Bonner. While I served the electorate for 13 years all up, there was a brief break between 2007 and 2010. During this electorate imposed sabbatical, my passion and determination for the community never wavered. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the electorate of Bonner and share what an honour it has been to spend 10-plus years representing them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The biggest honour, however, is the way this community has allowed me to be their voice in parliament. I've met some incredible people on this journey, and every day brings new excitement, new challenges and new goals for my corner of South-East Queensland. In 2010 when I was returned to the seat of Bonner, I delivered a first speech for the second time, something that I've never taken for granted. In that speech I shared how former Senator Neville Bonner, whom this electorate is named after, embodied perseverance and a commitment to all Australians. In that spirit of perseverance and commitment to the community, I promised to serve the electorate faithfully and tirelessly.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a father to my two sons, Zachary and Micah, and husband to my wife, Fang, you are a big part of the reason I love representing the community. Your support and love for where we live drives me to make our community and our country a better place. Whether I'm visiting small business owners, meeting with constituents or speaking in parliament, every day is about standing up for the aspirations of all Australians.
