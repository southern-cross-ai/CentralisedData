         I thank the member for his question and I note that this week he has been in his electorate inspecting the flood damage and assisting the people of his electorate. I also acknowledge the work of members from both sides of the House from northern

         and Queensland, who have been great advocates for their local communities in this time of need. Responding to natural disasters requires a whole-of-government response and a whole-of-community response. I can assure members that the Commonwealth government is playing its part. For instance, on 18 January this year
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Emergency Management Australia
         </a>
         arranged for our defence forces to transport portable flood barriers from New South Wales to Charleville and, on 27 January this year, Emergency Management Australia requested
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         assistance in the drop of fodder for stranded and starving cattle around Emerald. With the assistance of the Minister for Defence, two
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
          Black Hawk
         </a>
         helicopters were engaged to undertake the task of dropping the fodder.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of financial assistance, under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the Australian government is providing financial assistance to the governments of Queensland and New South Wales to assist them in coping with the disaster. That assistance includes measures such as alleviating personal hardship and distress, the provision of low-interest loans and assisting to restore public infrastructure damaged by floods. In terms of assistance to business, after the Prime Minister inspected flood areas, he announced a package for business. Under those arrangements, small business and primary producers will be entitled to grants of up to $5,000 and $25,000 respectively. As to tourism, again as a result of representations from local members from the affected areas, the Australian government has announced another $300,000, which is being matched by the government of New South Wales, for a tourism recovery package to assist the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          North Coast
         </a>
         region of New South Wales. In addition, the government has provided over $3.3 million in flood mitigation measures in Charleville and Emerald.
        </p>
        <p>
         As mentioned this week by the Prime Minister, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Australian government has activated the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment Scheme to assist flood-affected families by providing payments of $1,000 to adults and $400 for children. As the Prime Minister has said in remarks supported by the Leader of the Opposition, the Commonwealth government remains committed to working with local communities to respond to the immediate impact of the floods and to assist in their recovery from the longer term consequences.
