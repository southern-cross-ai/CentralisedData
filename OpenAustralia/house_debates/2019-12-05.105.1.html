        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I too am very confident about Australia's future, so will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is working to make it even better through its plan to create jobs for Australians? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for her question. I share her optimism about the future and so does everyone on this side of the House. We are going to back in Australian businesses, Australian industry and Australian workers. Because we have got strong and stable leadership and we have shown responsible economic management, we have set up the industry conditions that businesses need to be able to grow and to create the jobs for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         There's been great news today. The October figures show that total manufacturing exports are up compared to the same time the year before, not just by a little bit but by a huge amount. Total manufacturing exports in October were up almost $1 billion compared to the year before. That is close to 10 per cent. That is a huge increase.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me tell you that it is so disappointing that those opposite cannot applaud Australian industry and Australian manufacturing when they have come up with outstanding work and outstanding effort. It's just shameful. Do you know why? I know why they can't do it: because they've lost touch with the Australian people and the Australian workers. The Morrison government is the government for small businesses and the Australian worker.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about alternative approaches, and what I can say is that there are actually no alternative policies coming from those opposite—not one. There's not one policy. There is no way that they can continue to maintain and claim that they support Australian workers, because the evidence is really clear that they don't. All you took to the election was a policy that was going to tax the Australian worker more than they already were. We actually took policies to the election and we have been implementing those policies now to make sure that we grow the economy and we create the jobs of the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will continue to support businesses. We will continue to grow the economy. We will continue to create jobs while those opposite could not grow weeds in a greenhouse.
