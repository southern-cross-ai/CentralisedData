       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to record my condolences to the passing of William Devere Bowtell, known as 'Bowie', who was born July 1925. 'Bowie' was a great friend of many people in my electorate of Oxley. Bill 'Bowie' and his wife Peg lived in the Redbank area for over 70 years. They only recently celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill, sadly, passed away on 19 June this year aged 88. 'Bowie' was one of those inspirational peopleâ€”someone who was heavily involved in the local community. He was looked upon by many as somebody who gave them guidance, support and was always a tireless worker in the area. He was also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and devoted many, many hours and days, weeks and months of his life to supporting working people in the local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a great branch member and somebody who had been involved over his many years in all sorts of little local battles and skirmishes and some of the great fun events of the Labor Party, including many, many, elections. He could always be seen on election day, be it state, local or federal, helping and supporting someone.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was also a very active member of the Redbank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        subbranch and, to his last days, was always very active on Anzac Day and other memorial days. He always made sure that local people and local children remembered what our soldiers, men and women had done for this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a member of the Redbank auxiliary fire brigade; a longstanding member, since the 1950s, of the Goodna and District Rugby League Football Club as an active participant player; and was also part of the Goodna and Districts Old Boys Club in his later years. He was highly respected as a community champion. He was a mentor and leader, shaping the behaviour and character of others and teaching them how to respect others. He had had been involved in the preselection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hayden" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for service to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        He will be sorely missed by so many people, not just in the Labor Party, the RSL, the fire brigade or the old boys rugby league club, but I know he will be very much missed by his family, Peg, and his many friends in the local area. Our thoughts are with them and we wish them very well.
