        Leanne Gardiner is an early childhood teacher at the Maryland Care and Early Education Centre. Leanne was one of three recipients from

        , which were presented in Melbourne last week. She was selected from more than 1,000 nominations from across the country to receive the award for innovation in teaching. This was based on a project that introduced preschool students to Peruvian culture and geography.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before travelling to Peru last year, Leanne made contact with an underprivileged school in the city of Cusco, and, after discussing the differences between schools in Peru and Australia with her students—in particular, the lack of resources—together they developed a donation drive to deliver pencils, paper and craft items to the school in Cusco. I am told one child even gave up a favoured book from their bookshelf. The children learnt basic Spanish, and were taught about mud brick by making their very own mud bricks—a messy exercise, I am sure. When Leanne returned, the children were fascinated by her travel stories and her mementos. I am told of one lesson where the children learned about the fabric wraps Peruvian women use to strap infants to their bodies. That day, each child was able to try out the wrap sling using a doll.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maria, the centre manager, says it is this diverse classroom environment that inspired the parents and school management committee to nominate Leanne for the award. This is a not-for-profit centre with 52 students and 14 educators, a centre which is proud of the high quality care it provides, the workplace ethos in which teachers strive to excel and where professional development is supported. Clearly, this is producing results. Natalie, Leanne's colleague from the preschool, says this about Leanne:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She has inspired me to be an early childhood teacher. She sees the best in me and has a really high standard for our services and I aspire to be like her.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a strong advocate for the work of early childhood educators, but this is a sector that has been undervalued.
       </p>
       <p>
        As policymakers, we must commit ourselves to the ongoing improvement of early childhood education. We must acknowledge that child care enables parents, in particular women, to work, but this should not come at the expense of children's learning and development needs. We must meet the challenge of skilling and training the next generation of educators to the standard we expect and at the same time ensure it is a desirable career path that continues to attract the best and brightest. To do this we must start with respect for the fine work of early childhood educators and the important role they play in a child's life. I will have more to say in this place about this, particularly about the Productivity Commission's inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        For now I wish only to praise the achievements of Leanne Gardiner and the Maryland Care and Early Education Centre. It is a tremendous achievement to win this award, Leanne. I congratulate you and the students and families who nominated you. They are among many excellent centres in my region and, of course, across the country. Congratulations, again, Leanne.
