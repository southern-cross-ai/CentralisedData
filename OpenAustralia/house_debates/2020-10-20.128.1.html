        , based in my electorate, has been allocated $245 million in the federal budget to establish a new campus, specialising in creative industries, business and technology courses. The satellite campus, which will be based in Perth central business district and will house the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_Arts" rel="nofollow">

        , is scheduled to open in 2025 at a total cost of $695 million, with the university contributing $300 million and the WA state government providing land worth $150 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public awareness of the significance of this funding commitment to the higher education sector in Perth is only just beginning to be realised, with many residents still relatively unaware of the scale of the tertiary education project. For residents in my electorate, it means a wider range of courses and subjects to choose from, and access to a broader selection of learning facilities and educational resources to equip them for future careers in the workforce. This investment by the federal government transcends electoral boundaries. It does not matter where students live, their access to world-class educational facilities is literally on their doorstep within the Perth metropolitan area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Perth city campus will complement the courses offered at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECU" rel="nofollow">
         ECU
        </a>
        's main Joondalup campus, based in the Moore electorate. It is expected to accommodate more than 8,000 students and 1,200 staff. The new campus should not be viewed as competing with the Joondalup campus. To the contrary—having a campus based in Western Australia's capital city will function as a gateway to channel international and interstate academics, students and researchers to ECU, putting it on the map. The modern, state-of-the-art facilities will boost the reputation of the university, which already ranks among the world's top 100 universities under 50 years old, enhancing the status of its alumni and the prestige of its degrees.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the futuristic vision of the vice-chancellor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Steve_Chapman" rel="nofollow">
         Professor Steve Chapman
        </a>
        , who, in a few short years since arriving in Australia and commencing his tenure, has led the ECU team to institute what is a transformational education asset for the benefit of future generations. Professor Chapman first briefed me on his visionary plans to establish a capital city campus more than two years ago—a massive undertaking for both government and the university.
       </p>
       <p>
        The contribution of the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, the Hon.

        , must be recognised. Minister Tudge visited the electorate on two occasions to discuss the federal government's City Deals program, more broadly. We met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">

        mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Jacob" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Jacob
        </a>
        , and the chief executive officer, Gary Hunt, to discuss our regional infrastructure needs for a growing population. I also thank the Minister for Finance, Western Australian Senator Mathias Cormann, who was instrumental in turning this ambitious proposal to expand our local university into a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the construction phase, the project is expected to deliver $1.5 billion in economic activity and create more than 3,100 local jobs, adding to the government's economic stimulus program. The campus site is located at the central Perth City Link, adjoining the railway station. Interestingly, the northern suburbs railway passes adjacent to ECU's Joondalup campus, effectively directly connecting both campuses with public transport. It is envisaged that the creative and performing arts talent to be nurtured at the city campus will add to the entertainment offering for visitors to Perth city, particularly during the evenings, supporting the local hospitality industry and adding vibrancy. If the City of Perth succeeds, then all of us, as Western Australians, collectively share in that success as our capital city prospers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected lord mayor of Perth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Zempilas" rel="nofollow">
         Basil Zempilas
        </a>
        , and wish him all the best in transforming Perth. This $245 million investment by the Morrison government to expand our local university is good for our capital city and positive for Western Australia as it expands the higher education opportunities for the younger generation across the Perth metropolitan area.
