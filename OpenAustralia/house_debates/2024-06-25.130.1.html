        THISTLETHWAITE (—) (): Michael Joseph
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Shea" rel="nofollow">
         O'Shea

        was a legend of the labour movement who, sadly, passed away in February this year, having lived a very full 90 years. He was dedicated to his family, his union, his Catholic faith, the Labor Party and the service of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        For an astounding 75 years, Mick dedicated himself to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        , starting as a young shearer and a member and rising to become a respected organiser and, later, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        branch secretary and a life member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        . I first met Mick when I started with the AWU at the age of 22, and we remained mates right up to the end.
       </p>
       <p>
        His life in the labour movement began in the shearing sheds of Coonamble, where, at just 15 years of age, he stepped into the role of provider for his family after the untimely loss of his father. Mick's early years as a shearer shaped his unwavering work ethic and his commitment to standing up for the rights of workers. He had a rare ability to resolve disputes with humour and compassion and was involved in some of the labour movement's toughest battles, including the wide comb dispute in the 1980s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond his official duties, Mick's influence extended to supporting Labor candidates in the central west of New South Wales and establishing Country Labor in Dubbo. Mick and his wife, Shirley, were both life members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . Even after retiring, Mick remained committed to service, volunteering with St Vincent de Paul and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        To Shirley, his beloved wife, and his family, I extend my deepest condolences. Rest in peace, Mick.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the environment: I am proud to be part of an Albanese government that is delivering stronger protections for the environment. Our Nature Positive Plan is another way of safeguarding our country's natural treasures, plants and animals. We're also establishing Australia's first-ever independent environment protection agency.
       </p>

         Last Thursday
        </a>
        evening, I joined 200 locals, with the member for Wentworth and Dr Stephen Lightfoot from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Conservation Foundation
        </a>
        , for the Eastern Sydney Q&amp;A Nature Forum. The key topic of discussion was Labor's Nature Positive Plan. The community has welcomed our plan, noting that previous governments had failed to set up an agency to enforce environmental laws. Our reforms will enhance environmental protections while supporting sensible development—a commitment I've upheld throughout my parliamentary career.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the forum, I was asked about my efforts in defending the environment in Sydney's east. It provided me an opportunity to reflect on the significant achievements of our community, such as preserving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabar_Headland" rel="nofollow">
         Malabar Headland
        </a>
        and creating the national park. I've also opposed the New South Wales Liberals' plans for a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay, in a successful campaign with the community there. We have managed to work together to save
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Little Bay
        </a>
        , so far, from overdevelopment by Meriton, and prevented a large incinerator from being built in Matraville near residents. I'm committed to not only protecting nature but leaving it in a better state for future generations.
