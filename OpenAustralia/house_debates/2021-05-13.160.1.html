        I want to join my colleagues in expressing my deep concern at the current outbreak of hostilities in Palestine and, in particular, the situation in Jerusalem and the recent escalation of violence. The situation and timing of this escalation is no accident. It began during the holiest of days, amidst the holiest of months, in the holiest of cities in the world. Anyone who has walked its ancient streets knows how much pride of place Jerusalem has amongst the Palestinians who collectively celebrate the intersection of the world's Abrahamic faiths. In this spirit, today also marks Eid, and I want to take this opportunity to extend my warm wishes to all Muslim Australians and, in particular, those in my electorate whose celebrations have been clouded by the ongoing tragedies. At a time when the streets of Jerusalem and its ancient quarters are traditionally lit with festive lights, landmarks are instead being lit by the flashes and sounds of weapons. It's also a time which marks
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Nakba" rel="nofollow">
         Al Nakba
        </a>
        , referred to as 'the catastrophe', which symbolises the devastation of the Palestinian homeland and the continued displacement of its people, which, 73 years later, sees no just resolution for the Palestinian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is happening defies the international community and the resolutions endorsed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        ; punishes, through draconian measures, a population exercising their basic human rights in

        , recognised as Palestine's capital under international law; and belittles the international community in the face of its ongoing failure to deliver on its own resolutions. Statements by Israel's political leaders that this is just the beginning are not the statements of a member state of the international community that is seeking peace and stability. They are the hallmarks of the failure of the international community to bring justice and a lasting peace to this longstanding conflict, where we all have a collective responsibilityâ€”the United States, the United Kingdom, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_States" rel="nofollow">
         Gulf States
        </a>
        , the Europeans and Australia. It is our responsibility here in Australia to step up and serve as a diplomatic middle power, true to our values and to the international institutions on which we also rely on for our own peace and security. Never has there been a more critical time to ensure that justice, international law and the resolutions of the international community actually stand for something. And failure to do so means that we will all have to carry the consequences of this ongoing conflict.
