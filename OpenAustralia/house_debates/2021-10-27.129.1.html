       <p>
        I've long been a passionate advocate for thoroughbred racing. Racing Australia estimates that the industry makes an economic contribution of $9.5 billion every year, with half of that going to regional areas. In fact, there are 376 race clubs across Australia, and 95 per cent of these are in regional areas. The industry employs around 75,000 full-time employees in regional areas. There are an additional 156,000 breeders, trainers and owners involved nationally. I'll also put on record that I don't mind a punt myself—responsibly, of course—but, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        approaching, I say: only bet with what you can afford to lose.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I'm concerned about the rise of online gambling at the expense of punters at clubs, pubs and racetracks. I'm concerned that online gambling has accelerated during COVID. I'm concerned that the companies benefiting most are foreign-owned gambling giants, who are licensed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        and sending their megaprofits offshore—companies such as Sportsbet, Ladbrokes, Bet365 and many more. Some of the megaprofits end up in Gibraltar, where they have some gambling licenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also concerned that these operators are represented in Canberra by Australian lobbyists. The Australian lobby group known as Responsible Wagering Australia exclusively lobbies for the interests of foreign-owned online gambling bookmakers. They are currently not on the foreign influence transparency register, and I think they should be. Parliamentarians should know who is ultimately pulling the strings when lobbyists knock on their doors. If it's good enough for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Downer" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to be on the foreign influence register for assisting the government of Gibraltar when its in trade negotiations, I think it's good enough for Responsible Wagering Australia to be on the register for assisting the economy of Gibraltar too.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I can assure the Australian public is that, when you place a bet with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAB" rel="nofollow">
         TAB
        </a>
        , that money stays in Australia. The money earned from TAB outlets in Australia is passed back to fund Australian racing. It goes towards prize money et cetera. In Flynn, there are over a dozen racecourses in my electorate—Gladstone, Emerald, Springsure, Bluff-Blackwater, Dingo, Thangool, Monto, Taroom, Eidsvold, Wondai, Gayndah and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Perry" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Perry
        </a>
        . They do not race every Saturday, of course, but they have seasons when they do race, some only twice a year. Of course, there are numerous TAB outlets.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to supporting racing in Queensland and racing in Australia in the future, and I want to see racing remain strong and the regions remain vibrant. This will be the case if the money stays in Australia and it doesn't go overseas. Remember: if you have a losing bet on the TAB, all is not lost, as it's supporting Australian race clubs and the industry itself. When you bet online with overseas bookmakers, all of the money goes offshore. Better still, back winners, not losers, and put the money in your own pocket.
