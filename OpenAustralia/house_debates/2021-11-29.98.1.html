        My question is to the Prime Minister. The government signed up to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">
         COP
        </a>
        26 request for countries to strengthen their 2030 targets by the end of 2022. But just hours later, the government said its 2030 target was 'fixed'. Why did the Prime Minister tell the world one thing and then tell the Australian people the exact opposite?

           The member who asked the question has misrepresented what occurred at

            COP
           </a>
           26. They can't just bend it to suit their political sledges and to try and pursue the political games they so much enjoy and love in this place. What was put forward by the member is just incorrect. We have a 2030 target and we have a plan to achieve that 2030 target. We have a 2050 target and we have a plan to achieve that target.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite don't have a 2030 target. They don't have a plan to achieve that target. They don't have a plan to achieve even their 2050 target and, as with so many things before this next election, they are a vacant space, so all the Australian people can assume is what they did at the last election, which was to have targets.

               26 is that we will have a 35 per cent reduction in emissions on our 2005 levels. We're already at 20.8 per cent below our 2005 levels, which exceeds so many other countries, like the United States, Canada,

               , Japan, Korea and many more. The Australian achievement on reducing our emissions, particularly for economies such as ours, has occurred at the same time as we've seen the largest expansion of our

                LNG

               industry. Our government is delivering on reducing emissions but at the same time ensuring that we're seeing electricity prices fall. Our policy is about technology, not taxes. Those opposite are interested in taxes; we're interested in technology. They reject our policy, which is for technology, not taxes. That's what our policy is. They're not for that. Our policy is for people to have choices, not to be told what do to do by the government when it comes to what they want to buy and what they want to drive. That's our policy. We want choices, not mandates. Those opposite are opposing our policy. Our policy is to have a portfolio of technologies, whether it's hydrogen or carbon capture, use and storage. We want to see the funds from
