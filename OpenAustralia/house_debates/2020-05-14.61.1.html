        Recently, the Goldstein community lost two of its community stalwarts: Robert 'Bob' Burnell and Greville Gowty. Together with their wives, they contributed over a hundred years of active service to our community, to our country—to keep it a liberal democracy—and, of course, to our wonderful party. Bob, after retiring from the Victorian police force continued to serve the community, working with the former member for Isaacs,

        . Greville was an architect who made a significant and lasting contribution to his local community of

        .

        Both men served with distinction as senior branch office-bearers and year-round community leaders. They were always willing to get stuck in and lend a hand. They were always working to improve the lives of their fellow Melburnians and, of course, our local community. It's men like these, and others who volunteer, who enrich our community and make it a wonderful place to live, learn and grow. Their passing is not only a great loss for their families, of course, but for the greater Goldstein community. Bob is survived by his wife, Margaret, and family. Greville is survived by his wife, Marjorie. On behalf of everybody, we want to thank each of them for their service, their contribution to our community and a life very well lived in the service of Australia.
