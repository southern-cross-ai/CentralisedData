        I rise to add my voice to those of my fellow members and the many Australians who have also passed on their condolences for Corporal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Atkinson" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Atkinson
        </a>
        , who bravely lost his life during operations in Afghanistan. It was with deep sadness that I heard of the loss of Corporal Richard Atkinson, a 22-year-old constituent in my electorate of Solomon, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporal Atkinson was posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, based at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Barracks
        </a>
        in Darwin, after joining the Army in 2007. He completed his recruit and combat engineer basic training that same year, his first. Corporal Atkinson showed strong leadership and dedication to his role and, for his efforts, was promoted to lance corporal in 2009 and, further, rewarded with his promotion to corporal just prior to his section’s deployment to Afghanistan in October last year. Corporal Atkinson was leading his combat engineer section as a search commander when he was killed in action. He will always be remembered as a brave and dedicated soldier. His sacrifice for his country must never, ever be forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporal Atkinson leaves behind his parents, Ross and Kate; his brother, James, and his sister-in-law, Sumah; and his fiancee, Dannielle, a former neighbour of mine and constituent of my electorate. My absolute heartfelt and sincere condolences go out to her and Corporal Atkinson’s family, friends and comrades during this very sad time.

          <p>
           The very, very good member for Lyons, I should say! I have some other commitments—not that I rank those other commitments as a priority over this condolence motion; I certainly do not. But I appreciate the member for Lyons giving way to me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am of course here to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister—a condolence motion reflecting the life and good deeds of Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson. I did not know him, although it is possible I might have met him during my time as the Minister for Defence, but I do not need to have known him well to understand who he was and what he was. He would have been typical of those who serve in the Australian uniform on operations overseas.
          </p>
          <p>
           He was a volunteer, of course. It is always very important to highlight that, because the Australian community does need to understand that people like Corporal Atkinson do what they do both voluntarily and enthusiastically. They know the very serious risks involved and the potential consequences of those actions. On almost every occasion, and no doubt it is the case in this instance, they do so with the full support of their family, friends and loved ones. I think that is a very important message for the Australian community as it begins, even more as time goes on, to question Australia’s participation in Afghanistan. These brave young Australians understand why we are there, and they understand the risks. We are there for a very important reason, and we in this place should not ever speak in a way which indicates that we ourselves question those very important reasons. These men are there to make the world a safer place and to make Australia a safer place. It has been said many times in this place that most of the terrorist attacks that have injured or killed Australians have had some link back to Afghanistan and training by Islamists in that part of the word—not just Afghanistan but the north-west frontier provinces in Pakistan on the border of Afghanistan.
          </p>
          <p>
           So today we mourn him, but we thank him for what he has done for his country and we thank his family for allowing him to do what he obviously wanted to do, knowing the very great risk involved. It is also an occasion to reinforce the need for those of us in this place to understand that if we are going to send our troops into dangerous places we need to be properly resourcing them. I have no doubt that we are properly resourcing them. Questions have been asked about that from time to time. They even relate to some incidents that occurred in this place earlier in the week. We all need to remain vigilant, each and every one of us, in ensuring that government ensures on all occasions—without any question, without any exceptions—that our troops fighting in theatre have all the support and capability they need to do their job as effectively and as safely as possible. Again, to Corporal Atkinson I say: ‘Thank you for what you did and thank you for your sacrifices. We will never forget your deeds. Hopefully we will ensure that we follow our mission through in Afghanistan and in doing so ensure that your efforts were not given in vain.’

           <p>
            I rise on this occasion to pay tribute to Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson, a Tasmanian digger on his first appointment in Afghanistan. Corporal Atkinson was a brave young Australian serving his country, and his life has been cut short far too early. My heart breaks for his family—his dad, Ross, and his mum, Kate—and for his fiancée, Dannielle. I cannot imagine the anguish that they must feel at the loss of a son, brother and fiance. His death is a tragedy, and I extend my deepest sympathies to all who had the pleasure of knowing him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corporal Atkinson attended
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Church_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
             Launceston Church Grammar School
            </a>
            in my electorate of Bass. His principal recently spoke highly of him, talking of his popularity and leadership within the school community. He was clearly a man who cared for his fellow man and for his country. These same leadership abilities Corporal Atkinson demonstrated while at school he exhibited in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            . He was promoted to lance corporal in 2009 and by all accounts displayed strong leadership in bringing his section together during their preparation for operations in Afghanistan. His dedication to his section was rewarded with his promotion to corporal just prior to their deployment.
           </p>
           <p>
            His death is the 22nd since our troops entered Afghanistan, and at age 22 he was far too young. At this sad time, fallen diggers’ families are no doubt remembering their men who have died or been injured supporting our nation. Lest we forget the great sacrifice they have made. May I also add that our thoughts and prayers are with Corporal Atkinson’s colleagues, who are also feeling this great loss. They have lost a mate and a strong member of their unit. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the soldier who was injured in this tragic event. May he soon recover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me reiterate Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s sentiments. Our mission in Afghanistan is an important one. I am confident Australians are most proud of Corporal Atkinson and his dedication to his country. Corporal Atkinson and our other troops in Afghanistan are making a real difference. We have heard in media statements from family members and close friends that Corporal Atkinson was a family man with a great sense of humour and mateship. We have lost a true Aussie hero. Often it seems we take our military and the things it does on our behalf very much for granted. This has been a raw reminder of the sacrifices our Defence Force makes and a reminder of how lucky we are in Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Major Cameron Ellis, who commands Australian Mentoring Taskforce 2, says the death of Corporal Atkinson was a tragic and ‘stark, knife to the guts reminder’ of how important their job is as well as an incentive for troops to continue their efforts. His death will not be in vain. Corporal Atkinson will be remembered as a brave young Australian who served his country well. His courage, loyalty, resilience and determination were the making of a fine soldier. The Atkinson family can be very proud of Richard. He will remain in their hearts and minds and in the hearts and minds of all Australians. Rest in peace, Corporal Atkinson. Your bravery and courage will not be forgotten. Lest we forget.

             . I know that operational deaths are felt deeply across the wider defence family. As we know, Corporal Atkinson was born in Hobart in 1988, which is one year after I joined this parliament. He joined the Army in 2007 and he successfully completed his recruitment combat engineer basic training prior to being posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment based in Darwin. Corporal Atkinson was just 22 years old when he was killed as a result of an improvised explosive device in the Tangi Valley in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deh_Rawud" rel="nofollow">

              Afghan National Army

             . As a result of the

              IED
             </a>

            </p>
            <p>
             I was fortunate enough to visit

              Robertson Barracks
             </a>
             , in Darwin, just as Corporal Atkinson and his colleagues were due to deploy to Afghanistan last year, following extensive preparation. More recently I was in Afghanistan—only a fortnight ago—with many of his comrades, prior to his unfortunate death. This week I contacted Brigadier Gus McLachlan, Commander 1 Brigade in Darwin. He assured me that he had made all the necessary support arrangements for the family of Corporal Atkinson.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that Corporal Atkinson displayed strong leadership in bringing his section together during their preparation for operations in Afghanistan. I know that Corporal Atkinson was an outstanding career soldier, and this has been testified to by Brigadier McLachlan on a number of occasions. He was also a decorated soldier, having been awarded the

             and, most especially, his family. While I know that I never met Corporal Atkinson, those who knew him describe him as a ‘funny man, always putting smiles on other people’s faces’, and a person with a real taste for adventure. Corporal Atkinson’s commanding officer, Major David French, spoke of his professionalism. He said in the eulogy at

             Base Darwin to honour the arrival of Corporal Richard Atkinson back in Australia. He will be mourned but honoured by his colleagues, for whom he was a mate. On behalf of the government and myself, I offer whatever support I can provide to Richard Atkinson’s family and friends through this difficult time and assure him and them that the sacrifice of this astounding young soldier will be remembered. We will not forget him.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will conclude by making an observation. I said at the outset that this young man was born one year after I was first elected to this parliament. I do not regard myself as being that old, but he was one year older than my son. When you visit and speak to Australian Defence Force personnel, these brave young men and women who serve this nation, you see that the cream of Australian youth have joined the Australian Defence Force to defend our nation and you see how proudly they wear that uniform, how justly proud they are of the job they do. The sacrifices they make on our behalf can never be underestimated and I do not think are often properly understood. They show enormous valour and courage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Corporal Atkinson’s service to this nation epitomises the sacrifice that has been made by so many in the past for all of us, so when we mourn his passing we need to celebrate his life and the contribution he has made. It is no easy thing to say goodbye to your family, put on the uniform and carry a weapon, because immediately you do that it demands things of you that those of us not in uniform can never really contemplate. So I say to his comrades and to his family that we do appreciate and really value the service that he has given to our great nation. It should make us all the more determined to ensure that, as all of our Australian Defence Force members, wherever they may be, carry that uniform with such great pride, we take pride in making sure they have got the wherewithal to do the task that we require of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lest we forget.

              I rise to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the condolence motion in honour of Corporal
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Atkinson" rel="nofollow">
               Richard Atkinson
              </a>
              , who was tragically killed in action by a roadside bomb on 2 February 2011.
             </p>
             <p>
              At just 22 years of age, Corporal Atkinson was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. Our thoughts are with his family—his mother and father, Kate and Ross; his brother, James; his sister-in-law, Sumah; and in particular his fiancee, Danielle. It is a time of great sadness for them. Whilst this condolence motion is in no way likely to ease their pain, we mourn the death of Corporal Atkinson, a brave young soldier who had so much life ahead of him and we wish those close to him courage and strength into the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whilst Corporal Atkinson died tragically, he died with great honour serving our nation in the cause of making Afghanistan a place safer from terrorism. His sacrifice is not in vain. He also served in Indonesia in 2009 on Operation Padang Assist. We mourn with Corporal Atkinson’s colleagues in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and the wider

               Australian Army
              </a>
              . They have lost a mate and a fellow soldier. In particular our hearts go out to his comrade Sapper Rose, who was wounded in the same incident, and to his family and friends. I wish him well in his recovery. It is also a difficult time, I imagine, for the 21 families who have also tragically lost loved ones. They must sadly grieve for the loss of another Australian soldier.
             </p>
             <p>
              Corporal Atkinson’s death is the 22nd loss our nation has faced in Afghanistan, and to date there have been 168

              personnel wounded in Afghanistan, many grievously so. We make no mistake: deployment in Afghanistan is dangerous work. However, it is extremely important work that serves to make our world a safer place and that has the full support of the coalition. We support all of our soldiers, pray for them and give thanks for their individual efforts and sacrifices.
             </p>
             <p>
              We will remember Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson as a hero of our nation. Lest we forget.

               I want to join the members for Lingiari and Aston in remembering Corporal Atkinson, at 22 a very brave and a very young man. He was a member of Darwin’s 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and he died when our enemies exploded an improvised device last Wednesday week.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our thoughts are with Corporal Atkinson’s family and his fiancee, Dannielle. I am very pleased to hear that the Minister for Defence is ordering even more devices that can be used to combat these weapons used by the Taliban which have caused most of the casualties against our Australian service people who are fighting there. I will say something about that fighting in a minute and the justice of the cause, despite the difficulties, in Afghanistan. First of all, I want to associate myself with the comments of the Prime Minister about Corporal Atkinson’s fiancee. She said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Her pain—
              </p>
              <p>
               that is, Dannielle’s pain—
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I believe, is almost beyond our imagining and we should not pretend that the uttering of words of condolence in this chamber today will ease that pain. But today we honour her sacrifice and we are united in wishing her the courage and the strength she will need for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was asked by the former defence minister, the member for Hunter, to be involved in a ramp ceremony for Private Greg Sher, one of our 22 heroes who have been killed in action in Afghanistan, and I have stayed in contact with the family since. In speaking in this chamber about his demise I said that as a member of parliament I do not think I had done anything as difficult as participating in the ramp ceremony, with the family standing opposite and the coffin holding his body coming off the plane that had arrived from Afghanistan. I will never forget seeing the faces of his parents standing opposite me. It makes all of us understand the true seriousness of our involvement in a war of any kind. The fact that we sit here in this Australian parliament, in the bubble in Canberra, and ask people to be involved in these very difficult circumstances on our behalf is really brought home to us by the honest representation that I think the leadership of this country on both sides undertakes when they participate in these very difficult funerals and ramp ceremonies, and the many ordinary members of parliament too who go along and do their best to assist the families. I think it really makes us understand the true seriousness of our involvement in Afghanistan.
              </p>
              <p>
               Corporal Atkinson was a very dedicated soldier with long career aspirations. His major, Major French, said, ‘Akka was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it.’ Corporal Atkinson is one of many thousands of heroic young Australians who have served with valour and skill in Afghanistan. A member of his family said: ‘Rich was the funny man, always putting a smile on people’s faces. He was hoping to start a family this year with Dannielle. He was a dedicated soldier with long career aspirations.’ Again, I think that is something that is important for us to understand. Although Corporal Atkinson was on his first deployment to Afghanistan, many of our people in the full-time military services have been on several deployments, including in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                East Timor
               </a>
               , Iraq and particularly now in Afghanistan.
              </p>
              <p>
               In my view, Corporal Atkinson is the real face of the Australian soldier. Both his regiment, the commando regiment formerly 4RAR, and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
                Special Air Service Regiment
               </a>
               are doing magnificent work on this country’s behalf in Afghanistan. From a purely military point of view, if one is to read all of the current literature on the success of our forces in Afghanistan, it is clear that Corporal Atkinson and his mates are continuing to achieve the high standard of military professionalism that we have come to expect of our forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               Indeed, it was interesting to read recently that Australian service personnel are finding these deployments more and more effective. They are being more militarily effective against the Taliban than they were in the past, and after all that is the reason we asked them to be involved. They are not simply involved in nation building. When I get emails from people questioning foreign aid to Afghanistan, I think of the important role that those young men and women out there in Afghanistan are fulfilling for this nation. They are preventing the kind of murderous activity we saw in Bali from coming here. It was wonderful to see our
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
                VC
               </a>
               recipient, who I will be speaking about later, say that so clearly when he was interviewed about this. He knew exactly what he was doing and it is my experience that our young professionals in the armed services know exactly what they are doing there on behalf of Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Corporal Atkinson’s contribution was for Australia’s sake and not simply for our good neighbourly intention of helping to reconstruct Afghanistan. He was there to make sure that the kinds of attacks that have occurred against Australians in Mumbai and in Bali do not come to mainstream Australia. Until Australia has an understanding and an assurance like all other countries represented in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
                ISAF
               </a>
               that the previous Taliban regime will not host al-Qaeda, which we all remember was the situation prior to the murder of 3,000 people on 11 September, we will be there. However difficult it is, the Taliban and their evil associates in al-Qaeda should understand that. Australians understand what they are about and, until we can be assured that these people will not be able to use that area to generate activity in our part of the world, Australia will be involved—and very effectively. I say this because I want the Atkinson family to understand that people across this country appreciate their sacrifice. As the Prime Minister said, we cannot pretend to understand the deep desperation that the family feels. But our service personnel are working in a just cause. They are working with full understanding and they are working with the backing of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, even though we would prefer not to be there, not to be spending our blood and treasure in Afghanistan.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was mentioned last weekend that the Taliban insurgents are losing their stranglehold over key southern provinces. Corporal Atkinson was killed by Taliban forces desperate to claw back control of the Tangi Valley in Afghanistan’s
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deh_Rawud" rel="nofollow">

               region in the wake of a successful coalition effort to drive them into the mountains. This is helping to achieve security for people in the towns, villages and cities there. Corporal Atkinson made an incredibly valuable contribution, as do all our young men and women there.
              </p>
              <p>
               I want to join with the minister, the member for Lingiari and the member for Aston and associate myself with our deep condolences to the family and our pride in the effort of Corporal Atkinson and his colleagues in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, our pride with the fellows in the 1st

                 Richard Atkinson
                </a>
                . Only 22 years of age, Corporal Atkinson was tragically killed while on combat operations in Afghanistan. A proud member of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and on his first deployment to Afghanistan, Corporal Atkinson will be sadly missed by his family, friends and a grateful nation. At this time our deepest thoughts and prayers are with his fiancee, Dannielle; his father and mother, Ross and Kate; and all their extended family.
               </p>
               <p>
                Corporal Atkinson loved being in the Army and loved being with his mates. In his eulogy, at a special memorial service at Multinational Base
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
                 Tarin Kowt
                </a>
                , Major David French told of Corporal Atkinson’s cheeky nature, his commitment and professionalism to the task at hand and of his natural leadership abilities. ‘Akka’ he said, ‘was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it. So farewell, Digger. While we mourn and miss you here, others who have gone before you will welcome you to the fold. Travel safely mate, we miss you.’ These powerful words were expressed by one soldier to another and say it best.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let it be known that Corporal Atkinson’s ultimate service to his country was not in vain. His efforts in Afghanistan and those of his fellow service men and women are helping to make that country a better place and the world more secure. It is an international mission, in which Australia plays an important part, and is making a real difference. The mission in Afghanistan is and will be long, hard and painful. Twenty-two Australians have already been tragically killed and 168 wounded, including Sapper Rose, who was injured by the same improvised explosive device that took the life of Corporal Atkinson. We say to each of our fallen soldiers, fellow service men and women, and particularly today to the family and friends of Corporal Atkinson: our thoughts and prayers are with you always and a grateful nation will never forget.

His brother will remember all their fun and games and many adventures. His fiancee, Dannielle, will remember how much they loved each other and the dreams they had of the future that they would share. In spite of the terrible grief of the Atkinson family they will all know why Richard chose the path he did, why his personal qualities made him a leader, why he loved his job, why he was regarded as a great young solder with steely resolve and why he always wanted to do his job properly and lead from the front. They will know why the words of Major French, which we have heard today, are so relevant:
