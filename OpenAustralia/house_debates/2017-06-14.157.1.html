        in my electorate has been named, today, as an academic centre of cybersecurity excellence by the minister for education and the minister for cyber security. The federal government is delivering $1.9 million in funding over the next four years to Edith Cowan University and the University of Melbourne to further cybersecurity research and develop expertise in combating online threats. The centres will encourage the commercialisation of cybersecurity research in the interests of our economic and national security and prepare graduates for the workforce. A key element of the government's $230 million cybersecurity strategy is to ensure that Australia has sufficient highly skilled and capable professionals to keep it safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is estimated that, globally, there will be a shortage of up to 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2020â€”just three years away. The Australian cybersecurity industry is predicted to triple in size over the next 10 years, offering excellent career prospects for information technology professionals. Currently, up to 20 per cent of jobs in the sector within Australia are unfilled due to a shortage of suitably qualified professionals.

        has established its reputation as a leader in cybersecurity research, producing more than 1,000 graduates from its undergraduate cybersecurity program since 2001. The Security Research Institute based at ECU is one of the leading cybersecurity and digital forensic groups in the world, and it is also recognised for its expertise in human, physical and aviation security. The institute, led by Professor Craig Valli, consistently delivers quality outcomes in computer and digital forensics, network and wireless security, information warfare, physical security and risk management. The institute was recognised by the
