        My question is to the Minister for Education. Our future workforce needs university educated employees, particularly across aged care, health care, education and disability, and nowhere more so than in regional, rural and remote Australia. Yet rural and regional Australians obtain these qualifications at a lower-than-average rate. Forty-four per cent of Melburnians hold a bachelor's or higher degree, compared with only 11 per cent in Albury-Wodonga and eight per cent in Mildura. There is huge, untapped potential for rural and regional Australians to meet these skills shortages. The government's Napthine review provides the blueprint for doing this. Will the government commit the funding to implement the review's recommended actions?

         I thank the member for Indi for her question. It's a very important question because we do have to lift the attainment rates in regional and rural areas. I know that, like her, the members for Grey, Forrest, Barker, Murray, Parkes, Gippsland, Durack and all the regional and rural members on this side of the House want to lift that attainment rate. That is why we commissioned the former

         He has handed down an incredibly comprehensive review with seven key recommendations: first, improve access to tertiary study options for students in regional, rural and remote areas; second, improve access to financial support to support greater fairness and more equal opportunity; third, improve the quality and range of student support services; fourth, build aspiration—and I know that's something all of us want to see when it comes to regional and rural students; fifth, improve participation and outcomes for regional, rural and remote students from equity groups, including low

         students; sixth, strengthen the role of tertiary education providers in regional development and grow Australia's region; and, finally, establish mechanisms to coordinate the implementation effort and support monitoring of the strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Morrison government has agreed to all of these recommendations and will over time begin implementing.

          Those opposite laugh. They have no interest in this subject whatsoever, and we have started. I say to all members of the House, especially those on this side that are interested in this subject, that nominations close on Friday 13 December for the next round of our regional university centres. I know there will be one going into Wangaratta. I say to all members that we extended the deadlines for those nominations because of droughts and fires and to give communities an extra couple of weeks to be able to apply. To all the regions and all the areas who want greater higher education participation, please get your nominations in for this very important recommendation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over $500 million has already been provided since 2016 to lift participation for regional and rural higher education in our regions. We want to continue delivering. That's why we put in place a new scholarship program to lift students going from other places to regional and rural areas to study, to bring international students to regional and rural areas to study. We have an ambitious agenda to improve higher education attainment in regional and rural Australia, and we will deliver on it.
