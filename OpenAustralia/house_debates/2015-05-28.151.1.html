       <p>
        I would like to talk about a terrorist incident that took place on 9 May in the Macedonia town of Kumanovo. A 28-hour battle took place in which 44
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovar_Albanian" rel="nofollow">
         Kosovar Albanian
        </a>
        terrorists had crossed the border before this event, gone to Kumanovo and hired adjoining houses. Basically, they had shipped weapons and explosives across the border. Their plan was to destabilise the Republic of Macedonia. They were going to do this by an attack on shopping centres and other public buildings. It was going to take place in the middle of May. But after this 28-hour battle, in which the Macedonian police that had intervened lost eight of their own numbers, it had inflicted 14 dead. Another 30 terrorists had been arrested as a result of this. Their plan was to attack and destabilise the ethnic Albanian party, which is part of the government of the Republic of Macedonia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been pretty critical over time of the terrorists coming out of Kosovo. It is understood that many of those that were part of this terrorist group were actually mujahideen veterans from Syria and Iraq. Once the bodies of the dead terrorists had been returned to Kosovo, they were then given, as I understand it, a state funeral. Also, they were buried in the martyrs' cemetery in Kosovo.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is quite a disturbing series of events. On other matters, I have certainly talked about the attempts by, sometimes, Albanian separatists and others to destabilise the Republic of Macedonia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Balkans" rel="nofollow">
         The Balkans
        </a>
        has, unfortunately, a long history of instability. Borders have changed many times over the years. The borders of Greece have moved quite far north as a result of the treaties from 1912-1913. There are many ethnic groups within all countries in the Balkans region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think what we are seeing here is an attempt by militants and terrorists from Kosovo—Albanian separatists, if you will—that want to see another change of borders. They want to take territory and destabilise the Balkans. I think this is another example of why more needs to be done by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        and the European Union to include the Republic of Macedonia within their number. It would be a good thing for regional stability of the Balkans.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a serious matter—there is no doubt about it. On this occasion, it is unfortunate—a tragedy really—that eight police were killed in that 28-hour battle. It was no shame at all that 14 terrorists were killed. That was a very good thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It just goes to show again that we need to be very careful. We need to foster the circumstances of stability wherever we can, but the lead on this certainly needs to be taken by the European Union and by NATO. As I said, it is important that they do include the Republic of Macedonia amongst their numbers. That will then quiet down these separatists—these people responsible for instability in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude by congratulating the police of the Republic of Macedonia for their dedicated work to the stability of their country and to national security. It is a great tragedy that eight of their number lost their lives for this cause. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Republic of Macedonia
        </a>
        , Mr Gjorge Ivanov, has convened the state security council, which consists of the leaders of all the major parties. I think Macedonia is on the right track and, with a little bit of help from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        and NATO, security and stability will be guaranteed.
