         I thank the honourable member for her question. The government certainly shares the serious concerns that the international community has about the advances that have been made by the ISIL death cult, particularly in eastern Syria and northern Iraq. Overnight, the Prime Minister has addressed a special session of the United Nations
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         , chaired by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , to address the issue of foreign terrorist fighters. The Prime Minister has assured the Australian people and the audience at the Security Council that this government will be vigilant. It will be vigilant at home and it will be vigilant abroad, and we will do whatever we can to ensure that our country remains safe. It is the highest priority of this government and should indeed be the highest priority of any self-respecting government.

         As the Prime Minister noted in his address, the conflict in Iraq and Syria may seem to be distant, but it is reaching out also to us. Last week an Australian operative in Syria instructed his local network to conduct demonstration killings. That, of course, prompted a rapid response from Australian authorities. This week, an Australian terror suspect has savagely attacked two policemen, leaving an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         officer seriously wounded. I am happy to report to the House that the Australian Federal Police officer is now in a stable condition, and it is our understanding that the Victorian police officer who received stab wounds will be able to leave the hospital later today. But there are 60 Australians already fighting with ISIL, and another 100 or more providing support from within Australia. Sixty passports have been suspended to prevent more Australians from joining these groups in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         On 14 September the Prime Minister announced that Australia would deploy ADF assets and personnel to an international coalition effort's to disrupt and degrade ISIL. We will be prepared to be involved in what needs to happen. Australia will not fight alone, but we will be prudent and proportionate in our contributions. It is an international effort that now involves around 40 nations.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has met a number of world leaders at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         , and they have been able to exchange views on how the world will best be able to cooperate to meet this new threat to our freedom and our way of life.
