        Men's Sheds build so much more than great woodwork; they build community, connection, mateship, engagement and belonging. To support the wellbeing of local men's sheds in Robertson, the federal government has provided $4,090 in combined funding to the Gosford Men's Shed and the Wood Glen Workshop under the National Shed Development Program. These grants will support men's sheds to be able to purchase tools, facilitate training and maintenance, and provide

        for their members. I recently had the opportunity to visit Larry and the team at the Gosford Men's Shed to see firsthand how their grant is assisting the shed. They're not only working on traditional woodwork projects; they also restore bicycles and fix lawnmowers and power tools to help people in our community. The men at Gosford Men's Shed gather together to share a skill, learn something new or simply sit and chat, usually over a tea or coffee and a treat from the local bakery. These acts of supporting one's community—sharing skills and life experiences, and working together on a new project or challenge—create the social cohesion and supportive environment that men's sheds are known for. I commend the Gosford Men's Shed and the Wood Glen Workshop on being successful in this grant and for the incredible work they do in our community. I'm really looking forward to visiting the Wood Glen Workshop this Friday to be able to thank their members in person as well. I'm really proud to be part of a government that remains committed to supporting important community organisations like these.
