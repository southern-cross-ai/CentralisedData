        Country Championships. Athletes from Alstonville, Lismore Workers, Trinity, Casino and Grafton swimming clubs all competed in Sydney. Those from Alstonville Swimming Club included Thomas Bowker, Madeline Ewing,

       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all these young swimmers from our community. You did us proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge the Casino Dance Academy, who recently celebrated their 50th year in our community. Maryann Bentley founded the academy in 1970 and it is still going strong today. Maryann was the youngest of six children and was the only girl. She found her passion for dancing through her mother, Jean, and her grandmother Flo Hollyman, who taught Highland dancing. From a very young age, all Maryann wanted to do was start her own dance studio. When she left school, Maryann worked with Nela Pinkerton, at the very well known Pinkertons jewellers, and Nela was kind enough to give Maryann time off, which allowed her to open the dance studio.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, there have been some very successful students who have gone on to become professional dancers, most notably Matthew Trent from Kyogle, who become a principal artist with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Ballet" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Ballet
        </a>
        , one of the highest positions someone can get to in the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maryann's daughter Renae Chelman is now continuing with the next generation of Casino Dance Academy students, including her daughter Olive, which makes four generations at the studio. I congratulate them and the whole team.
