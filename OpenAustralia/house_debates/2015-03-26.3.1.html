       <p>
        For the information of members, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which participated in the 23rd annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Quito, Ecuador, from 10 to 15 January 2015 and the bilateral visit to Peru from 16 to 21 January 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the second year that I, as Speaker, have led Australia's delegation to the APPF. The members of the delegation this year comprised the member for Herbert, Mr Ewen Jones; the member for Lalor, Ms Joanne Ryan; Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald; and Senator Anne McEwen. A delegation from the Australian parliament has participated in every meeting of the APPF as well as the meetings that prepared for the establishment of the forum. The APPF is an organisation that is highly relevant to Australia. The countries that participate are significant to our strategic and economic interests, and the APPF meeting addresses important subject matter. All delegates have an opportunity to develop their understanding of the subject matter and the perspectives of the region's parliaments and each agreement on the resolutions of the meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now turn to the subject matter of the meeting and the work of the Australian delegation. As is customary, there were three broad subject areas on the agenda—politics and security; economic and trade matters; and regional cooperation—as well as the future work of the APPF. In December 2014, in advance of the annual meeting, the Australian delegation proposed draft resolutions on the five topics that delegation members were to speak on in the plenary. The topics included strengthening peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region; alternative policies and new approaches to combat terrorism and other transnational organised crime; open and non-exclusive cooperation to foster free trade growth, investment and sustainable development; mobility of social rights and a common legislative framework for social protection; and cooperation in disaster prevention.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to our statements in the plenary, delegation members participated actively and effectively in working groups in order to achieve combined draft resolutions to go to the drafting committee. Senator McEwen and I represented the delegation at meetings of the drafting committee, where 18 resolutions were agreed to go to the plenary. The final joint communique of the forum, which was signed by all leaders of all participating nations, included as an attachment the text of the 18 resolutions, seven of which were co-sponsored by Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the APPF's 23rd meeting, the delegation undertook a short bilateral visit to Peru. The delegation had the opportunity to meet with the President and members of Peru's congress and to deepen its understanding of Peru's economic priorities and the scope of the Australia-Peru bilateral relationship. The delegation was warmly and courteously received at all meetings and visits. As delegation leader, I was able to take the opportunity to raise with Peru's deputy minister for foreign affairs Peru's support in relation to Australia's management of the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge the very helpful assistance provided to the delegation in preparation for the meeting. Before departure, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra and the Parliamentary Library assisted us with briefing materials, and the International and Parliamentary Relations Office provided logistical support. In Ecuador, Australia's ambassador, Mr Tim Kane, and staff and, in Peru, Ambassador Mr Nicholas McCaffrey and staff provided excellent advice and support. My thanks are also extended to my chief of staff, Mr Damien Jones, and the delegation secretary, Ms Robyn McClelland. I believe that the delegation represented the parliament most effectively.
