        It's no stretch to say that this year we have a renewed appreciation of the wonderful work that volunteers do in our community. Soo today I rise to congratulate Wendy Roberts, a local volunteer with the

        </a>
        , for her 58 years of dedicated service to the people of the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Wendy is a true pillar of our community. Not only has she been with her local Erowal Bay brigade, now amalgamated into the Crossroads brigade, for more than half a century; she has also spent 38 years with the Jervis Bay Lions Club, as well as dedicating herself to the local

        and Meals on Wheels. She has spent time helping and supporting others because she loves to do that. She is an inspiration to us all and deserves our recognition and praise.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I was so thrilled to see Wendy named Rotary's national emergency services community volunteer winner recently. It was definitely a tough pool, with so many amazing volunteers who have stepped up this year to support our community. I was proud to see Wendy receive this recognition for her tremendous years of service to the South Coast community. Thank you, Wendy, for everything you have done to help and support others. Volunteers like you make our community a better place, and there has never been a better place than the South Coast. Well done, also, to all our amazing volunteers who were nominated for this award. You are all stars this year.
