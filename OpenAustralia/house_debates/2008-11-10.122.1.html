        I would like to share with the House three community events that involved residents of the Shortland electorate over the last two weeks. The first event I would like to share with the House is the biannual Hunter Valley Porcelain Art Society exhibition, which was held at Club Macquarie and displayed porcelain art from Hunter and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        artists, but many of the members and organisers of the exhibition live in the Shortland electorate. I would like to congratulate the artists on the fine work. It was an outstanding exhibition. You could see the many hours of work that those who put together that exhibition had put not only into organising it but into the art that was visible on that day.

        The other two events I would like to mention are two breast cancer morning teas I conducted within my electorate. One was at the Gwandalan Bowling Club and had the support of the Gwandalan Lionesses, and other one was at the Windale-Gateshead Bowling Club. Those morning teas raised in excess of $1,000. I thank all the guest speakers who spoke at those morning teas, including outstanding representatives from Central Coast Area Health; Professor Forbes, a leader in the treatment of and research into breast cancer; and also members of the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation. They were outstanding mornings.
