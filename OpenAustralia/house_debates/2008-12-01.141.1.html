        It is imperative for the future of Australia and Australia’s next generation that we recognise the need to invest in education and improving the skills of all Australians. We need to invest in education and skills, whether it be for a young child at school or for a mature person wanting to return to the workforce. That is why the outcomes of the 24th

        meeting this weekend are so significant. Many of the reforms were agreed upon and are about improving health and education and training outcomes. Significant additional resources were allocated to these areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        For over a decade, the Howard government showed a complete lack of commitment to investing in the future education and skills of Australians. Australians saw a need for long-term strategic policymaking—and that is what they voted for in electing a Rudd Labor government. It is common sense. The more you invest in education, skills and training, the more you invest in your country’s future. We owe it to young people to give them the best possible start in life. The Australian government has made a commitment to provide educational avenues to all young Australians so that they can achieve their very best. There are many schools within my electorate of Hindmarsh that will benefit from this weekend’s announcement.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to be aware that young people in the many schools in our neighbourhoods need resources so that they are able to make choices to help them be successful and productive members of our society. COAG agreed that every child needs access to high-quality education and training, starting from an early age. The new agreements for education and skills and workforce development set out reform directions, specific deliverables and roles and responsibilities. Under these agreements the Commonwealth and the states will work in partnership to lift the quality of education and training and target resources to where they are most needed. Government primary schools will receive an additional $635 million over the next four years as part of the new national education agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary schools play a crucial role in preparing young Australians for the future. Until now, primary schools received a smaller proportion of funding per student than government secondary schools. From 1 January 2009, this inequity will be abolished and funding for government primary schools will be increased. This will see an increase of around $100 per primary school student each year for the four years of the new national education agreement. The new agreement has been developed with the objectives of improved attendance and engagement in school and improved literacy and numeracy performance. Australia will have world-class school performance measurement and reporting, designed to suit the needs of the Australian community and drawing on the experience of other countries. Primary schools will also benefit from additional funds of $550 million to improve teaching, $540 million for literacy and numeracy, and $1.1 billion for disadvantaged schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary school represents a crucial stage of learning and developing knowledge and attitudes to learning that will shape future life chances. The Australian government will also invest more than $2 billion in the digital education revolution, after agreeing to provide a further $807 million to states and territories for legitimate on-costs. The additional funding will be paid before the end of the 2008-09 financial year. This funding will cover the legitimate on-costs incurred for computers purchased through round 1 as well as future on-costs associated with subsequent rounds. The Rudd Labor government established the National Secondary School Computer Fund to bring our classrooms into the 21st century. The digital education revolution will ensure Australian students are equipped with the tools they need for the workforce of today and tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        COAG agreed that addressing educational disadvantage arising from low socioeconomic status requires sustained effort involving a whole suite of reforms to fundamentally transform the way schooling takes place. This new low

         SES
        </a>
        school communities funding agreed by COAG directly addresses this challenge. Through this seven-year national partnership, the Commonwealth will provide $1.5 billion over seven years to address the needs of disadvantaged schools. This funding will support significant reform initiatives in about 1,500 schools in low socioeconomic status communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd Labor government is determined to tackle the challenges of education needs in Australia. This is across the board, from early childhood to high school to trades training.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        children should be given the opportunity for quality education. This government is delivering on that commitment.
