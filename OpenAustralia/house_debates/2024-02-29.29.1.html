       <p>
        On Wednesday last week I was delighted to join with the Coolart Community Garden at the magnificent Coolart Homestead in Somers in my electorate. The Coolart Community Garden was awarded $7,000 via the Stronger Communities Program, a very popular and effective program which has since been abolished by the Albanese government. The project involved the purchase of six Biofilta wicking bed cubes, which I learned are specialised raised garden beds made in Australia. The cubes elevate the herbs and the vegetable plants and make the garden much more accessible for people of all kinds of abilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grant has enabled so much more than just the purchase of these beautiful garden beds, which are surrounded by Colorbond, another Australian made product, which also has operations just up the road in my electorate, in Hastings. These new garden beds have allowed individuals of all abilities to connect with like-minded people, learn skills and share their knowledge in a safe, relaxed and very friendly environment. There's a real sense of pride here not only to be able to contribute to the historically significant site but to have an opportunity to give back to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The garden, I am happy to report, is flourishing, and it has been able to donate fresh produce to the Western Port Community Support Centre. I shout out a thankyou to Andrew, Marnee, Di, Julie, the Somers Residents Association and all the volunteers, who make the Coolart Community Garden so special, including my old mate
