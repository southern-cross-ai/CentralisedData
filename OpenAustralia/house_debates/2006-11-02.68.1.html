        My question is also to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, would you outline to the House government initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations? Is the Prime Minister aware of support for this approach?

         </a>
         and, of course, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Treasurer, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Victorian Premier
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Premier
         </a>
         will all be aware of federal government initiatives not only to encourage renewables but also—and very importantly—to encourage investment in low-emission technology. What we have said for more than two years is that the most important priority in reducing greenhouse gas emission is to accelerate investment in clean coal technology. That was the essence of the white paper that was put out 2½ years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         That approach has been derided by those who sit opposite but this morning we find dramatic field evidence from two successful Labor politicians—namely, the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premier—supporting very much the whole approach that is being taken by the federal government. This morning, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Queensland
         </a>
         , who, of course, is the premier of the state that produces the most coal in this country—namely, the state of Queensland—and somebody who understands the impact of some of the careless policies flung around over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition on the workers in that state, had this to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We have credibility on clean coal technology. We have a good track record on this and we need to move to the next stage now.
        </p>
        <p>
         Listen to this!
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If we can get clean coal technology in a commercial way it will not only clean up Australia but also China and other developing nations.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is what the Premier of Queensland had to say and his words were echoed by the spokesman for the Victorian government who said that they were putting their faith in clean coal technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is exactly what was in mind when the Callide A power station in Queensland was in receipt of $187 million from the government’s low emission technology fund. There is an investment at Fairview Power leveraged by federal government investment of $445 million. And at International Power Pty Ltd in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Latrobe Valley
         </a>
         , an area very well known to the member for McMillan, there is a proposal worth $360 million to retrofit brown coal drying, combined with ultra supercritical coal technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is exactly what we have been talking about for 2½ years, and this is exactly what the Labor Party, sitting over there in opposition, have been deriding for the last 2½ years. But they have been shown the way by their successful state colleagues.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beattie" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Beattie
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bracks" rel="nofollow">
          Steve Bracks
         </a>
         have shown the way on this issue and, tellingly in the light of the remarks made by the member for Grayndler, Mr Beattie had this to say. In light of the fact that the two states have committed a combined $400 million to clean coal technology, Mr Beattie declared that Queensland favoured it over renewable energy sources because it was ‘more practical and it will work quicker’. Those were not the words of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Macfarlane" rel="nofollow">
          Ian Macfarlane
         </a>
         , although John Howard and Ian Macfarlane agree with those words. I think both Ian Macfarlanes would agree with those words. Even the other Ian Macfarlane would agree with those words.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our position is very clear. For 2½ years we have been arguing the cause of clean coal technology and today we have seen the premiers of Queensland and Victoria blow the Leader of the Opposition out of the water on this issue, and, in the process, detonate the member for Grayndler. I thank the member for McMillan for such a searching question.

           My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer you to a Newspoll published today which shows that 79 per cent of Australians think Australia should ratify Kyoto, 86 per cent of Australians think the government should be doing more to tackle climate change and 92 per cent of Australians think the government should significantly increase investment in renewable energy. Does the Prime Minister agree with his parliamentary secretary who dismissed 92 per cent of Australians as just cafe latte drinkers, and does this explain your 10 years of inaction and climate change scepticism?

            I think it is the job of political leaders in this country to read opinion polls but to do what they think is right for Australia. It is as simple as that. It may surprise many of those who sit behind me to know that the Leader of the Opposition has only become—how shall I put it?—an eleventh hour convert to the cause of ratifying Kyoto. Some years ago he was not quite as excited about it. In tireless research on this subject, it is amazing what you come across. Maybe there was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was influenced by these words from a person who came from his own native state of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australia
            </a>
            . This is what this person had to say, writing in November 2001:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            For Australia to ratify the

             Kyoto Protocol
            </a>
            is to commit to a policy of decarbonisation of our industrial and export base. It is to inflict upon its people unemployment, profound economic dislocation and decline. For a nation to inflict upon itself such economic and political damage is almost unprecedented.

            Those were the words of a highly successful finance minister in the Hawke and Keating government by the name of Senator Peter Walsh. I’ll tell you what: he was a lot more successful than any of you who sit opposite. He was a senior minister in a government. Let me simply say to the member for

                  Mr Speaker, let me say, through you, to the member for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Ports" rel="nofollow">
                   Melbourne Ports
                  </a>
                  : yes, I have read that online poll—I think the member for Melbourne Ports understands the import of that adjective. I have read that online poll. Let me tell him and let me tell the Australian people: we listen to their views on this issue. We are aware of the need to take practical measures to address greenhouse gas emissions, but I say to them: we are not going to take measures that destroy the great comparative advantage that this country has, we are not going to be panicked into knee-jerk responses that will hobble great productive Australian industries with enormous costs that are not borne by their competitors overseas and we are not going to ratify a protocol which, in the words of a highly successful Labor minister, would do damage of an economic kind on an unprecedented scale to the great wealth-producing industries of this country.
