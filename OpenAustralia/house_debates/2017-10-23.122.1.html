       <p>
        I'd like to speak today about the wonderful work that the chaplains do in our schools in Queensland, and, I suppose, to take a little bit of a trip back down memory lane to when I was the parent of young school starters, many, many years ago. And that situation, of course, may be not so much down memory lane but in the present or the very near future for many in this House today and for many of the parents and families around the electorate of Forde. I'd like us to reflect for a moment on what it is to be a parent of a young child in school, and the pressures, struggles and worries that can go along with it—especially for families in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where can parents go to learn more about their child's development? Where can parents go to learn about the resources in their local area or the upcoming events they might be able to attend with their families? Where can parents go to get information on school banking or to learn more about dental hygiene or to participate in a playgroup? Surely there are many places, you might say, but there would not just be one place that could offer all of these things.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, in my electorate of Forde, I'm very blessed with two schools where there is just such a place—a community hub, where mothers, fathers, carers and families can come and feel connected. The hubs have been established at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Logan Reserve
        </a>
        state schools, and they are the initiative of one of our dedicated local chaplains, Marlo Bronzi, who works with Scripture Union Queensland. By teaming up with the school principals, local council and community, Ms Bronzi has developed two wonderful spaces—and I was very glad to see the Logan Reserve facility at firsthand recently—that have enabled families to reach out for help and support in ways that might never have been available otherwise. It is the existence of the National School Chaplaincy Program and the work that the people it employs do that have facilitated that development. And that is the heart of what I wish to speak about tonight: how greatly we should value school chaplaincy in our nation and, in particular, the work being done in my home state of Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, did you know that, in Queensland, over three-quarters of the pastoral conversations with chaplains take place with primary students? Chaplains work very hard to support these students in their formative years so that they're better equipped for the future. Did you know that Queensland chaplains spend over 80 per cent of their school break times with students? Chaplains have a genuine heart and desire to reach out to and to help young people. Across Queensland, did you know that, in the average school term, chaplains run 358 breakfast programs, 167 educational support programs, 396 social and emotional programs, 257 spiritual support programs and a further 239 community development events and activities?
       </p>
       <p>
        Chaplains' support in our school communities is designed to promote social, emotional and spiritual wellbeing for all. So who are our chaplains? They come from all walks of life. In Queensland, 39 per cent of chaplains are male and 61 per cent female. Most chaplains are from generation Y, with 42 per cent aged between 21 and 35. While all our Queensland chaplains meet the minimum qualification standards set by the state and federal governments, 85 per cent of them exceed them, with qualifications at diploma level or higher, across areas such as youth work, human services, education, theology and ministry. We have chaplains at 223 schools in North and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        and 248 schools in south Queensland, and in many other places across the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        As school chaplains endeavour to promote individual resilience in our students and in our families every day, they provide opportunities and give important advice to our youngest and most vulnerable, and not only to them but also to the teachers and parents at the school. I had the pleasure of attending the chaplain's dinner at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        recently. It was a great night and a very positive reminder of what can be achieved when communities work together. Our schools are among the most important foundations in our society. I would like to thank our chaplains for the wonderful work they do in supporting those in need across our community, and not just the youngest in our community but the parents, teachers, principals and support staff at our schools as well.
