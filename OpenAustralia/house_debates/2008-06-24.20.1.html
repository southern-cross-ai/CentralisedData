        My question is to the Attorney-General. When did the Attorney first become aware of the concerns of Ms Melissa Batten, a former staffer of the member for Robertson, regarding the preparation of a statutory declaration?

        <p>
         I will set out the facts of this important matter. Yesterday, in light of matters in the public domain and following consultation with the Prime Minister, I sought advice from my department as to the appropriate course of action to pursue with respect to these matters. These matters, as members are aware, are the subject of investigation by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Police. I will quote from the letter of advice I received from my department:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under the arrangements which exist between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales Police
         </a>
         are able to investigate and charge people with Commonwealth offences.
        </p>
        <p>
         The advice continued:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Where New South Wales Police are already conducting an investigation, the usual practice for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , if the same events or circumstances are referred to it, is to liaise with the New South Wales Police to see if it can provide any assistance in relation to the investigation. This arrangement avoids unnecessary duplication of work and inconvenience to the people and witnesses involved in the investigation.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. With respect to the Attorney, he was asked when he first became aware of the allegations.

            I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the point he made. As I said at the outset, in light of matters in the public domain, I am outlining for the benefit of the House the action I took. Obviously matters in the public domain over the weekend and indeed yesterday motivated the course of action that I have taken. I am outlining to the House the very important matter. I will continue to quote the advice from my department:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            In these circumstances, I advise that an appropriate course of action for you to take at this stage would be to request the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            to contact the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            Police to ascertain whether they would be assisted by the Australian Federal Police conducting an investigation as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I, in turn, acting on that advice, wrote to Commissioner

                 That communication issued today is material for honourable members in respect of this important matter. The advice from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales
                 </a>
                 Police is that the commissioners have agreed that
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales Police
                 </a>
                 will remain in charge of the investigation until its conclusion, which is expected to be in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That is the point I would draw to the attention of all honourable members. We have in this country complete operational independence of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Federal Police
                 </a>
                 force. That is confirmed by section 37 of the Australian Federal Police Act. We also have, significantly, a presumption of innocence.
