        Last year 309 organ donors gave 931 Australians a new chance in life. Despite these being the highest numbers for a decade, regrettably this still leaves 1,700 people on the Australian organ donation transplant list. These individuals are often on the list for anywhere between six months and four years. If you are very desperate for a donation, four years is obviously a very, very long time to wait, and this can be very detrimental for those that are in urgent need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite having one of the highest rates of success for transplant operations in the world, Australia has one of the lowest donation rates in the developed world. Considering the well-known Australian spirit that we will always lend a hand and help out, it is safe to think that the reason why there is a lack of donation is really a lack of awareness and of the discussion that leads to donation. It is well known that the majority of Australians support organ donation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government’s national reform package that has recently been introduced with the agreement of the states is truly a significant step forward in raising awareness of the issue of organ donation. It is a much-needed effort to significantly increase the number of people who are willing to—and, more importantly, are aware of how to—give the gift of life. The $151 million for the organ and tissue donation national reform package is a crucial step towards increasing awareness of this highly significant issue and informing members of the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a part of this reform, the government has funded 150 dedicated doctors and nurses and 60 ancillary staff in 76 hospitals. This is for work specifically on organ and tissue donation as part of the DonateLife network. We often put ourselves in the hands of our doctors and obviously we put our trust in their judgment. The trust that the public has in our medical staff should also be treated as a great resource in assisting in driving up the rate for organ donation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In approaching this issue, it is crucial to understand that one in three Australians do not know that their family member has consented to organ donation. Clearly, once someone tragically dies and there is a bereavement, organ donation is not the first thing that comes to the minds of the bereaved. Organ donation is the gift of life, yet so many people do not know how to give the gift. Despite an individual deciding to become an organ donor, their family still has to be asked to give consent to donation if the situation arises, so when you make the decision to give somebody the gift of life it is absolutely critical to talk to family members so they are comfortable and confident in your decision. The discussion will make saying yes much easier for family members and will minimise the sense of doubt and, possibly, regret. It is much easier for your family to have the discussion now rather than at the time of a tragic loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        That discussion is particularly significant if we keep in mind that 93 per cent of Australians say that they would uphold the donation wishes of their loved one if they were aware of them. It would be extremely sad if an individual missed out on a chance for a fresh start in life simply because the family of a possible organ donor was not aware of their loved one’s wishes. In urgent circumstances, the 40 per cent of Australians who do not know the views on organ donation of their loved ones can make a difference to someone living or dying. That is why it is important to have Donate Life Week and all its events. The week is for us to raise awareness and to encourage people to have discussions and consider their choices.
       </p>
       <p>
        On average every organ donor in Australia contributes between three and 10 transplants. It is important for individuals to be aware of the potentially tremendous contribution they can make to others. Also, it may be difficult, but it is important for everyone to imagine the situation from the reverse perspective, the situation of someone giving life, hopefully, to one of their own family. I think that probably adds to the judgment call in becoming an organ donor. Each one of us could give another family the opportunity to experience a feeling of hope and gratefulness in a difficult situation. I call on all Australians to have a family get-together to discuss the issue of organ donation and to at least become aware of the options available to loved ones.
       </p>

        I have mentioned before the family of Debbie Roberts, who is a friend of mine. Her daughter Rebecca died in 2002 at 20 years of age. Before her death, Rebecca, a very forthright young woman, spoke up and made her intentions about organ donation very clear to her mum. Thankfully, Debbie, who is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        of Youth Solutions, respected her daughter’s wishes. As a result of Rebecca’s donation four people were given a remarkable gift. Two received a kidney and another two received Rebecca’s corneas. Debbie has graciously shared with me correspondence that she has received from the four recipients of Rebecca’s organs. It is very touching correspondence and it is very touching to see the effect that her organ donation has had on families. The letters show how profoundly people’s lives have been affected and enriched and how life has been given through Rebecca’s selfless decision to donate organs should she die. We owe Rebecca and many like her an enormous debt of gratitude for their decisions to donate their organs. I know Debbie well. Knowing and understanding her daughter’s wishes in respect of organ donation clearly made it a lot easier for her to consent to organ removal at the time of Rebecca’s death, a time of very great sadness for Debbie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debbie Roberts’s experience demonstrates, quite frankly, the hard reality of not only going through the pain of loss—in this case, that of her daughter Rebecca—but also having the pride and contentment of knowing that, through Rebecca’s selfless attitude to life in that giving of life itself, her daughter has left a legacy that is now living on today through other people.

         The progress of human civilisation has been marked with extraordinary breakthroughs in medical science. From the first transfusion of human blood, to the use of insulin to treat diabetes, to the Salk vaccine that rid the world of polio, we have seen vast improvements in our length and quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Organ transplantation was a similarly groundbreaking achievement. In 1954, the American surgeon
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray" rel="nofollow">
          Joseph Murray
         </a>
         performed the first kidney transplant between identical twins. In 1967 the

         heart surgeon
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Barnard" rel="nofollow">
          Christiaan Barnard
         </a>
         performed the first successful human-to-human heart transplant. Both of these events were defining moments in medical history and gave hope and new life to patients around the world. After years of unsuccessful attempts, the ability to transplant human organs was considered nothing short of a miracle, especially for those who could now rely on transplants to survive otherwise incurable diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, organ and tissue transplants are common procedures, and improvements in technology and technique has meant that the success rate for even complicated surgical procedures such as heart transplants have improved. The transplantation of human organs and tissue has saved the lives of thousands of Australians. Since 1965, more than 30,000 Australians have received transplants. With improved survival rates, recipients of organ transplants can enjoy significantly prolonged lives. For people with serious or life-threatening illnesses, organ and tissue transplantation means a second chance at life.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a testament to the achievements of our world’s medical scientists that we are now in a position to mark organ donation week—a week that encourages Australians to sign up as organ donors. An organ donor can potentially save and extend multiple lives. In 2010, 309 organ donors gave 931 Australians a new chance in life. Unfortunately, around 1,700 people are, at any one time, on the Australian organ transplant waiting list. On average, people on the transplant list must wait between six months and four years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The potential to save lives is huge if as many Australians as possible register. With the increasing success and popularity of organ transplants, the shortfall in donors relative to the requirement for organs is growing. We all have the power to save lives and prevent debilitating illnesses and it does not cost us anything. But cultural impediments and a lack of knowledge often prevent us from taking action. For many of us, organ donation is not something that we often think about. Many people, understandably, do not like to think about their own death. And so, although they may consider organ donation to be a noble idea, they do not think about it enough to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
         Organ donation week is about generating awareness and bringing the issues to the forefront of people’s minds. It is about making organ donation a common practice in our society, rather than something that is too morbid to discuss with friends and family. It is about making people feel comfortable with the idea of becoming an organ donor. It is also about giving people an opportunity to take action and register.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, I, along with a number of other members of this place, including the member for Canberra,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gai_Brodtmann" rel="nofollow">
          Gai Brodtmann
         </a>
         —she was here a moment ago—and also the member for Fowler, took part in the Donate Life walk around
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Burley_Griffin" rel="nofollow">
          Lake Burley Griffin
         </a>
         . What was inspiring about this walk was the fact that we were joined by so many hundreds of people from the local community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Organ donation week will encourage Australians to have a discussion about organ donation with their friends and family. It is important to talk about it with those close to you because registering as an organ donor, like I have, is not enough. Family consent is always sought, so it is important to discuss your wishes with family members to ensure your wishes are fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many Australians who would like to be organ donors but who simply have not been prompted to become one or have put it off for whatever reason. Yet we need to factor the discussion about organ donation into our life just as we would make time for a significant family birthday, a health check-up, making a will or, worse still, doing our tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         In many cases, people may assume that their consent is not required for their organs to be used after death. It is remarkable to think that one-third of Australians do not know that family consent is needed for their organs to be donated when they pass away. Many people may assume that there is an adequate supply of organs available for those who need them or that a past illness rules them out. It is always worth checking with a doctor to determine whether you are eligible to become a donor. You should not assume that you are ineligible.
        </p>
        <p>
         A common perception is that if you lived in the United Kingdom during the mad cow outbreak you are unable to become a donor. The fact is you are still able to donate organs and some tissue, and you should discuss these options with your doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to DonateLife, 98 per cent of Australians believe that organ donation has the potential to save and improve lives. Yet some people might be concerned about certain organs that they would not be willing to donate. This is not an obstacle. When you register, you can choose which organs you would like to donate. Donations can involve organs such as kidneys, heart, lungs, liver and pancreas. It can also involve tissue, including heart valves, bone tissue, skin and eye tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The value of organ transplantation is made most clear when you look at organisations like the Lions Eye Donation Service, a joint venture between the Lions clubs of Victoria and southern
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , the Centre for Eye Research Australia, the University of Melbourne and the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. They receive eye tissue donations from thousands of generous donors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Human donor corneas are needed in order to alleviate corneal blindness. A cornea transplant is the surgical procedure which replaces a disc shaped segment of an impaired cornea with a similarly shaped piece of a healthy donor cornea. It is important that organisations such as the Lions Eye Donation Service and the many donors who have taken the initiative to register for organ donation are recognised and celebrated this week.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, the shortfall in organ donations is very significant. There are more than 1,000 people on organ donation waiting lists but only 279 donations were made in 2009-10. One organ and tissue donor can save up to ten lives. Indeed, as I said, before 2010, 309 organ donors gave 931 Australian a new chance in life.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to place on record on behalf of the coalition my strong appreciation for those doctors and medical staff who ensure that we have the medical capability to save lives through organ donation as well as those Australians who have made the commitment to register as organ donors. If we can raise awareness and new donors, we will be raising hope for so many families whose lives will be transformed.

          It is a great pleasure today to speak on this private member’s business. I have been involved in the organ and tissue donation sector for the last five years and, prior to becoming the member for Canberra, I was a volunteer director on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_of_Life" rel="nofollow">
           Gift of Life
          </a>
          board for three years.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was great to have celebrated last week the first national DonateLife Week and even greater not to be involved in endless weekends walking around tables stuffing show bags—that is one thing I do not miss. It has also been great to be in this new position to speak to a range of people, including this chamber as well as other parliamentarians, to promote the need to increase our organ and tissue donation rates. Last week, DonateLife Week, throughout Australia was about promoting the message that any day is a good day to talk about organ and tissue donation.
         </p>
         <p>
          DonateLife Week is part of the Australian government’s national DonateLife awareness campaign to increase family discussion about personal donation wishes. Across the country, state and territory governments and their health departments join with the medical community, the not-for-profit sector and the many individuals and families affected by organ donation to lift Australia’s organ and tissue donation rate. The most important thing is that families need to know the wishes of their loved ones who have just passed on. That is what DonateLife Week is all about.
         </p>

          The DonateLife awareness campaign, launched in May 2010, produced a very positive increase in family discussion about donation wishes. The focus of this year’s campaign was to increase that level of discussion even further. In 2008 the government committed to a $151 million national reform program for organ and tissue donation. I commend and applaud the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for being one of the major drivers of this initiative. Last year was the first full year of implementing this world’s best practice national approach to organ and tissue donation. We have achieved the highest rate of donations ever in this country, which goes to show that when we all pull together we can achieve great results.

          In 2010 a record 309 deceased Australians donated their organs and tissue for transplant—saving or improving the lives of 931 Australians. Here in the

          the number of organ donors has been increasing every year from four multi-organ donors in 2006 to 10 in 2010—again the best number ever. The 10 multi-organ donors last year transformed about 30 lives and restored sight to about 40 people. As a result of the government’s initiatives, the DonateLife Network now consists of more than 242 professionals in 76 hospitals and eight DonateLife agencies in each state and territory, specialising in organ and tissue donation.

          Two weeks ago the Minister for Health,

          , at the Australian Health Minister’s Council announced that in January there were 30 deceased organ donors, resulting in life-saving and life-changing transplants for 89 Australians—the highest outcome for January in Australia’s history. The challenge now is to sustain the increase and to build on it, because we still need to do much better. We need to normalise the subject of organ and tissue donation. Every Australian can be part of this national initiative by taking time to talk about being a donor, discover the facts, register their decision on the

          and, most importantly, discuss their decision with their next of kin.

          Public awareness is the crucial first step to raising Australia’s organ donation rates. I was pleased last Friday to attend the ACT Chief Minister’s Awards ceremony, where

           I also rise to talk about organ donation. My colleagues and I have become very familiar with the work of DonateLife. ‘Discover, discuss and decide’ are three very critical elements, but, having worked in the health sector, I have seen that it is not so much the statistics—of 98 per cent of Australians having an awareness or of the number of recipients of organs and tissues—but the real, live issues around what families experience. There are challenging situations that occur when a member of the family makes a decision to donate their organs but has not discussed it with their family; a discussion occurs in the corridors of a hospital hallway where a family is hesitant to agree to the donation sought by the deceased.
          </p>
          <p>
           That then causes angst in the decisions of doctors who, having based their understanding on having 10 recipients for the various organs and tissues, must then inform those families that what was a possibility has turned out to be unavailable. What I do like is the notion that we are pulling together as a community and as a society to develop awareness, to get people to commit and to get families to understand that the gift of life through organ and tissue donation has far-reaching consequences for the quality of life that an individual may experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was taken aback by a man in Darwin—he came from one of the islands to the north—whom I heard talk at a conference about organ donation. He had been told that he had a kidney disease and that he would need treatment in Darwin hospital. He came to Darwin assuming that, under the broad heading of ‘a donor organ’ he would go into the hospital, have his operation, be given medication and be allowed out. He did not understand that that was not the process. He said: ‘My knowledge was limited and I would have liked there to be a comprehensive awareness program so that I knew what I was facing when I went in. I didn’t think that I would walk into a hospital and then for the rest of my life be married to a machine.’ He said, ‘I was married to my wife and my machine became my life-saving device.’

           There are many Australians who live in the hope of tissue or organs becoming available in order to prolong not only their family life and their future within their community but also, more importantly, their capacity to contribute to the workplaces of Australia. I hope that, as DonateLife and many of us in this House continue to work towards the promotion of an organ and tissue donation mindset, many of those people who have waited for lengthy periods will have those periods reduced. Whilst we talk about 98 per cent of Australians having an understanding and an awareness, it is a matter of translating that into action that saves the lives of many and enhances quality of life.
          </p>
          <p>
           I acknowledge the medical profession and the support people who dedicate so much time to providing services for people who are waiting on the organ recipient list as well as, certainly, those whose research has made transplants safer and patient recovery much speedier than it was in the past. I must admit that when I worked in both
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
            NSW
           </a>
           Health and WA Health I was often moved when I walked through children’s wards to see children who were waiting for organs and parents who were living on hope. One parent said to me: ‘I live on the hope of somebody’s death. I don’t mean that in a morbid sense but in terms of prolonging the life of my child.’ That is a conundrum that many Australians face in this context.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I pay credit to DonateLife. I think that the process they have commenced is to be highly commended. I am committed to donating both tissue and organs when I am deceased and I hope that that decision will enrich the quality of life of another 10 Australians. The consequence of our decision to be donors is far-reaching and enriches the lives of many. I compliment DonateLife on the work that they have embarked on and will continue over the next two decades and I hope to see the number of donors increase exponentially.
