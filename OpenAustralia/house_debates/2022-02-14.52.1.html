       <p>
        May I take this opportunity to congratulate Scotty James on his silver medal in the snowboard halfpipe at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Winter Olympics
        </a>
        . Scotty grew up in Warrandyte in my electorate of Menzies. He first competed as a 16-year-old and, in the decades since, we've seen him consistently become one of the best performers in his area of skiing in the world, competing in World Cups and other outstanding events. In winning silver, Scotty improved on his bronze medal at Pyeongchang in 2018. So I congratulate him and wish him well.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the event, many may recall seeing the interview with him in which he said, 'Now I need to finish off my collection for the pool room in Italy in 2026.' We hope that over the next four years he can add to that bronze medal and silver medal with a gold medal to complete that collection. Not only is he one of the best competitors in his chosen sport; he's worked hard to secure the best training facilities that can possibly be provided for the halfpipe at

        in Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate the other Australians who have performed very well at the Winter Olympics, including Jakara Anthony and Jackie Narracott. But, indeed, just to compete in the Olympic, to be an Olympian, is a great achievement in itself, and I congratulate all the members of the Australian Olympic team.
