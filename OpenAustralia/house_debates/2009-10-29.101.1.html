        I rise today to speak in praise of Derryn Tal, a Sydney artist who won the Trevisan International Art Award in Ferrara, Italy, on Saturday last. Derryn’s success is no small achievement. Her exhibit was one of 80 presented by a very competitive field of artists from all over the world. It is interesting that many Australian artists often have to win prizes overseas before their talent is recognised here in Australia. Yet Derryn’s triumph in northern Italy does not surprise me. Derryn has rapidly been making a name for herself in the art world. As an abstract contemporary artist she specialises in mixed media painting. Her media ranges from acrylics to oil glazes to bitumen. As well as painting, Derryn’s creativity spans photography, collage, sculpture and rug design. She has also illustrated children’s books and calendars. Furthermore, Derryn has explored the use of petals and leaves in her art to create a range of delicate flower prints. Many people around this country know of her creative designs with rugs. Her husband’s very well known business, Designer Rugs, has very famous rugs throughout this building and many of the famous hotels in this country. Their designs in no small part are due to Derryn’s creativity.

        As well as Derryn’s other creative interests, she specialises in Jewish art and has a diverse range of truly unique Jewish prints. People who visit my office will see the very gracious painting that I received from the Tal family as a wedding gift. It is one of the examples of the art that I was just talking about. Derryn won the Australian International Youth Year stamp competition as well as the photographic competition with her horoscope photogram prints. Derryn is exhibited in both Sydney and Melbourne, and I am sure her award in Italy is the first of many international awards. I attended her Melbourne exhibition, which was a great success, and I celebrated her success in Italy with my dear friend Mr Yosi Tal, her husband, with whom I have been friends since university; and with her children, Alon, Rami and Shani, who are outstanding achievers in themselves, Alon being school captain of

        . We all look forward to Derryn having further exhibitions all around the world. The success in Ferrara is great credit to her, to Australia and to her art, and I hope it brings her the further recognition in this country that she duly deserves.
