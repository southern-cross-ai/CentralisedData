       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his announcement of his intention to improve the standards of behaviour of members of parliament. I also refer the Prime Minister to his press conference in Japan on 11 June, where he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the Prime Minister explain to the House what he meant by that term?

         For consistency, the first part of the question is in order.

          I am more than happy to answer the question. ‘Unacceptable’ means not acceptable, ‘pattern’ means a series of events and ‘behaviour’ means what you do. That is just the truth. As a consequence of that, having observed what transpired in Australia, I therefore took action on that in relation to an agreed activity concerning counselling. That is my answer to the substance of the question. On the other point which was raised, I will add to an answer to an earlier question which was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She questioned the sequence of a statement I made in Tokyo and a statement made by the member for Robertson. The statement I made in Tokyo was dated 9 June, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to it before. A journalist asked me: ‘Have you spoken to the member for Robertson? What would you say about what was going on and disciplinary action?’ The answer from me was:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          No I haven’t. Secondly I understand my office has been in contact, and thirdly I understand that she has issued a statement, and I draw your attention to that.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is a transcript of me, in Kyoto, on 9 June 2008. There was a media statement from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Neal" rel="nofollow">
           Belinda Neal
          </a>
          , the member for Robertson, on Sunday, 8 June 2008. That is the sequence.
