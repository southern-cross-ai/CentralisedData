        <p>
         It is somewhat difficult to put into words the feelings one has at this special time. Ending part of your life’s work is never an easy choice, but I guess making the choice yourself, rather than having someone else do it for you or to you, does have its blessings. This is my fifth and last term and, having now served into my 15th year, I have set a record for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         in the seat of Franklin. This is a record I am very proud of and it is something I will cherish for all my days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fourteen years and 184 days ago, I was elected to the House of Representatives. Being the 869th person elected to the House out of the 1,018 elected since 1901 enables me to claim to be part of an exclusive club. One of my deep regrets is that my father did not live long enough to see me here in the House. I know that he would have been very proud of me and what I have achieved here.
        </p>
        <p>
         The day of 13 March 1993 was momentous for several reasons: firstly, because Tasmania was the only state on daylight saving time and the swing to Labor was so great that I was able to claim the seat very, very early in the evening. In fact, it was the first seat to be declared on the night. Secondly, Franklin had returned to the Labor fold after 17 years in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Left" rel="nofollow">
          Centre Left
         </a>
         at the time, I was surprised in 1992 to receive the party’s nomination.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left" rel="nofollow">
          The Left
         </a>
         had tried unsuccessfully to win the seat for the past seven elections and were apparently willing to give me the opportunity as part of other factional deals they had organised. Even though I did not have a high profile within the electorate, I had taught in several schools and been a member of several sporting teams. I was convinced that, by dint of a lot of hard, grassroots networking over many years, I could win the seat back for the Labor Party. I had no wealthy or influential friends to recommend me as I entered the political fray. The only promise I made was that I would win the seat of Franklin and, having done so, work tirelessly to ensure that the electors of Franklin would be served, represented and advocated for at all levels of government without fear or favour.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have tried in my time in the House to be honest and true to myself and to those who have graciously sent me here for the five terms. Being a member of the smallest group within the ALP at the time—the independents—enabled me to express my individuality more openly, more freely and with no obligation to a union or a union warlord that would dictate how I must vote on a particular issue within the caucus or in the House. Sadly, in the world of politics, party representatives are often blinkered by dogma and rhetoric that, in my mind, belong to ages past. Individuality, personal beliefs and a commitment to what is best for your electorate are often cleansed from one’s persona ‘in the best interest of the party’. Having been here for five parliamentary terms, I have seen people from the three parties suffer and be punished for standing up for what they believe is right, proper and the just course of action to take. The withdrawal of paid positions within the party, the lack of advancement prospects and the ultimate sanction—exclusion and banishment—are all tools used to coerce members to toe the line.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, so many in this place are reluctant to tell it as it really is. There are so few willing to acknowledge that neither party has a mortgage on good policy and so few to articulate this fact. Showing your humanity and deeply held beliefs in this place is considered a sign of weakness and vulnerability. What a shame this is! Politics is a lonely business. If it were not for the support of one’s loving family and one’s very dear and close friends, as well as one’s dedicated and long-suffering staff, one would soon bow to conformity and all that that entails.
        </p>
        <p>
         Much has changed since 1993. After three years of the joys of being on the Treasury benches and enjoying the fruits of government largesse, I have spent the past 12 years suffering in opposition. Some would argue that unless you are holding ministerial or shadow ministerial office you are not a real contributor in the House. I would certainly beg to differ. During my time in the House I have had the privilege to have served on many fine House and joint standing committees—science and innovation, Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         affairs, family and human services, education and employment, and joint native title. In most cases, the unanimous reports handed down by these committees have helped to shape legislative changes that have benefited countless Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been privileged to represent the parliament on several overseas delegations and intercountry exchanges. Memories abound of my visit to Auschwitz; my first glimpse of the pyramids; standing in the trenches at Anzac Cove reading my father’s diaries; visiting Kuwait and seeing the aftermath of the first

          Mekong River
         </a>
         and seeing the effect of the unexploded ordnances in Laos; and having audiences with

        </p>
        <p>
         Who we are and what beliefs we hold dear have been influenced by our parents, our friends and our many and varied life experiences. I was fortunate to have been brought up by parents whose beliefs and deep faith had been forged by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
          World War I
         </a>
         , the Depression and their roles in their local church. As a child, along with my brother and two sisters, our family crisscrossed Australia from Victoria to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         to Tasmania and back to Victoria as Dad ministered to various parishes.
        </p>
        <p>
         After a year and a term as a teacher with the Tasmanian education department, I, along with my brother, emigrated to Canada and sought to start a new life in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" rel="nofollow">
          British Columbia
         </a>
         . I arrived in the United States in 1966 as the civil rights movement was in full swing and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         was also impacting on American society. I was confronted with many experiences, especially in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South" rel="nofollow">
          Deep South
         </a>
         , that would shape my life forever. Crossing America from Florida to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State" rel="nofollow">
          Washington State
         </a>
         on my way to Canada opened my eyes to a world I had only read about. Now I was experiencing it firsthand.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rather than teach, I wanted to be in the Canadian outdoors and so worked variously for the British Columbia highways department and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Great_Eastern_Railway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Great Eastern Railway
         </a>
         . When winter arrived, heavy snow fell and freezing conditions prohibited most outdoor work. My brother and I headed for warmer climes and lived in a Mexican village out from Guadalajara for three months. I eventually returned to Tasmania after an absence of two years and resumed my teaching career for the next 19 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 1988 I was fortunate to gain a position on Senator Michael Tate’s staff for the next five years. I very much appreciated the opportunities he gave me to work throughout the state of Tasmania. This time spent under his tutelage gave me a wonderful glimpse into the world of Australian politics and set me up for the career I have enjoyed in this House.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many people I wish to acknowledge today who have assisted me in my time here. To the clerks, who have advised and guided me in my duties as a member of the Speaker’s panel: I thank you most sincerely. Being part of the panel has given me the opportunity to better understand the processes of parliament and to hear some fine contributions by members. To the Serjeant-at-Arms Office, and Barry Gwyther in particular, who is sitting behind me, for literally saving my life last year when I was seriously ill and unable to find a doctor: a huge thankyou. Thanks also to the Serjeant-at-Arms Office for their instant responses to requests that often came out of left field. Thanks also to the people in the transport office, who have organised cars, changed booking requirements and requests at the last minute and have always had a white car waiting there for me. To those behind the glass window in the broadcast booth, I say a special thankyou. You have been part of my chocolate run, and I have made friends with many of you. Keep up the wonderful work you do behind the scenes. A very special thanks to the many security officers here in the house. Thanks for your friendship over the years and for the support you have given to me and my visitors. To Ann, a special thanks for her wonderful friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the many educators in the Parliamentary Education Office: a huge thankyou. As a member of the advisory committee for many years and as a teacher in my previous life, I have seen you all working with countless thousands of youngsters who visit the parliament and experience your expertise and wisdom by exploring firsthand how parliament operates through role-play activities.

         : thanks for your friendship over the years and a special thanks for assisting my daughter Sarah when she first began her career in journalism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lastly and most deservedly, a special thanks to my many friends in the Comcar fleet. Firstly to Murray in Hobart, who has been there for me over all these years: it has been great knowing you, and I wish you all the best for your future. To the drivers here in Canberra: I have really enjoyed your friendship, camaraderie, tact and honesty over the years. I am going to miss the opportunity to see you on the shuttle and to share our wine and movie experiences and our footy disappointments.
        </p>
        <p>
         My wonderful staff are here in the House today. To Roger, Glenda, Katrina and Vicki: you have been part of my life and part of my extended family. You have seen and experienced the highs and the lows, the disappointments and the marvellous victories, the treachery and the true friendships that make up the 15 years in office. It has been a great office, with everyone sharing the responsibilities for getting the jobs done. Your contributions are immeasurable.

         They say that you do not make many friends in politics, and I guess they are right. I can honestly say I have enjoyed many friendships across the chamber. A special and heartfelt mention must be made of my mate from the Mallee,

        <p>
         To my friends here who have stuck by me through my outspoken leadership statements, my anti-war stands and my decision to oppose at all costs my replacement, I can never thank you enough. Often I have compromised you and caused you grief and pain because people have heaped it on you too due to our deep and long friendship.

         We as politicians sit together with huge communication resources at our disposal to implement social change. We come to this House as empty vessels, as if to a well of knowledge, often only returning home again as little more than an empty vessel. No wonder community members despise or ridicule us. No wonder we lose elections and the love of the community we try to represent. Only when we can assist people to have processes which can lead to improvements in their communities and which improve their lives will we be greeted at home with warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia in 2007 is a nation faced with a burdening household debt, social suburban isolation in a land of plenty, an ever-increasing gap between the haves and have-nots, an epidemic of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes and the challenges of global warming. As well we see the increasing burden to our society from youth suicide and alcohol and illicit drug abuse. We have failed to honour our obligation to our Indigenous brothers and sisters to resolve their many problems. This leaves those who will enter the new parliament with many mountains yet to conquer. As

          Martin Luther King
         </a>
         so eloquently put it in a speech made in November 1956:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... through our scientific genius we’ve made of the world a neighbourhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we’ve failed to make of it a brotherhood ...
        </p>
        <p>
         Like Paul of old, I think I can rightly say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith ...
