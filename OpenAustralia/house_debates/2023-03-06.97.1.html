         Royal Commission

        into the Robodebt Scheme uncovered about what was said in public by former ministers in charge of the unlawful scheme versus what they actually believed? And how many robodebts were raised between the 29 May 2019 and 19 November 2019?

         I thank the member for Bean for his question. In the most recent block of hearings at the royal commission into robodebt, we've heard from Professor Renee Leon, the former secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         ; Timothy French,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHS" rel="nofollow">
          DHS
         </a>
         legal counsel; and the member for Fadden, the then Minister for Human Services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specifically, Mr French testified that, in a meeting in early July 2019, the member for Fadden was verbally briefed that the Australian Government Solicitor's opinion was that robodebt was on very shaky grounds—testimony which Professor Leon corroborated in her own evidence. Further evidence was given that on 31 July the member for Fadden appeared on the

         program, where he defended robodebt and stated, amongst other things, that 'in 99.2 per cent of the cases, the debt was correct'—99.2 per cent, he said.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, last week, under questioning by the royal commissioner, the member for Fadden admitted that he knew that what he was saying was false. The royal commissioner said:

        </p>
        <p>
         The basic position of the evidence of the member for Fadden was that cabinet solidarity allowed him as a minister to give statistics on robodebt that he did not believe to the Australian—

           Mr Speaker, you've given a ruling on several occasions on this matter. You've said that what you are less comfortable with is putting a construction on the evidence or the drawing of conclusions about the conduct of individuals who are party to the proceedings. I've listened carefully to what the minister has had to say, and he has now crossed that line. He should be reminded of your ruling and he should comply with it.

             I say this in all collegiality, but I thank the Manager for Opposition Business for giving me the chance to go to the precise quote. The member for Fadden, at page 4,220, says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             They were the numbers from the department based on the working approach to how the program was being run. They were the accepted figures by government to use. And as a dutiful cabinet minister, ma'am, that is what you do.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the commissioner replies, 'Misrepresent things to the Australian people?'
            </p>
            <p>
             The evidence was very idiosyncratic for the member for Fadden. The story that was being put in the royal commission last week was that there was a doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility that allowed the previous government to mislead the people.
