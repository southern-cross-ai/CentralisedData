       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge the outstanding contribution to the Canberra community by Maureen Cane, who recently retired after 10 years as chief executive officer of Communities@Work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the decade Maureen Cane has harnessed what she describes as ‘that wonderful Tuggeranong community spirit’ and has built an extremely successful community enterprise. Under her stewardship, Communities@Work has grown into an organisation with over 400 staff, more than 200 volunteers and 150 home based, family day carers. It provides services and facilities in children’s services, before and after school care, respite care, disability services and services for families and youth at risk. It offers services for school aged children and seniors, as well as training through its NuSkills Learning and Development.
       </p>
       <p>
        It initiated Business Tuggeranong, which brings businesses and employers together to promote the region as a great place to do business. I am a member of that group. It also presents many public events, such as the Celebration of Families and the Weston Creek Spring Festival. Communities@Work also runs OzHarvest Canberra, rescuing food so that charities and refuges across the

        can better assist people in need. It does everything.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a fitting tribute earlier this month when Maureen Cane was named Canberra Citizen of the Year. I congratulate her on her enormous achievements which have had a major impact on the greater good of the Canberra community.
