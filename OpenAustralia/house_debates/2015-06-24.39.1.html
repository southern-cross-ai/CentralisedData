       <p>
        Earlier this week, Leo Armstrong—'Uncle Leo' to me—passed away at the age of 92. He lived a life that seemed impossibly dramatic to me as a child. Leo was a navigator in the 'G for George' Avro Lancaster Bomber on display in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is hard to imagine today what it must have been like to be one of the Lancaster men—one of the most dangerous jobs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War" rel="nofollow">
         World War
        </a>
        2. Leo completed 32 operations from

        . 'G for George' was often considered a lucky plane, returning from 89 missions from Bomber Command. However, not all were so lucky. Fully 44 per cent of all Bomber Command air crew lost their lives, and a further 10 per cent were injured or taken as prisoners of war. Of the 7,377 Lancaster bombers built, 3,932 were lost in action. We should not forget their contributions in this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, Leo did survive and he lived a full life of service to his community and family. He was elected as the president of his beloved

        Leagues Club in 1980 and served as the club chairman for 16 years, from 1984 to 1999, including the club's first premiership in 1991. Leo was afforded life membership of the Penrith Panthers, and it was a passion he held for his whole life.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is survived by his wife, Joan, and by many loving family members. We remember his service in this House.
