        I had the privilege recently of joining the Active Elders Association in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Ascot Park
        </a>
        in my electorate recently for an afternoon tea and service to celebrate their new facilities. The Active Elders Association began with the assistance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Edwardstown, another of the active service clubs in my electorate. I have seen the hard work of Edwardstown Lions Club at a number of community centres, such as Glandore, for the Christmas carols evening, and the Camden Community Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1968 the Active Elders have been providing the community with a vital service for the needs of the over-50s. Active Elders is an award winning group, including community event of the year awards, citizen of the year, and outstanding community service awards. The group was recently successful in winning a grant from Marion City Council—I know there are a number of councils here today for various meetings—and, combined with their own fundraising dollars, they have managed to extend their building and install a new kitchen. One of their many community activities is their collection and shredding of newspapers to raise funds. So they are a very hard-working group.
       </p>
       <p>
        Younger generations such as those from the nearby Ascot Park Primary School visit twice yearly for a serious indoor bowls challenge, which is one of the many great activities they have at their facilities. I would like to acknowledge President Ron Baker, Treasurer Jan Hedger and the committee members of Active Elders Ascot Park for their dedicated service to the people of Hindmarsh.
