       <p>
        I take the opportunity to commend the great work of the South Coffs Community Garden at Bruce King Drive in Boambee East. It's a great facility that allows people to enjoy gardening, to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers—whatever they please—in a communal setting. It being on the north coast, many people have moved to the area quite recently and many of them are living in units and don't have the opportunity to enjoy gardening as they don't have the land available. Coffs community garden does the work of providing that opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to announce a Stronger Communities grant of some $10,000 to help the community garden build a new community centre. This will provide a place for members to meet and enjoy each other's company. It will also provide a water supply, because, regrettably, there is no water immediately available and they will depend on tank water to provide the water for all of the produce from the garden. The produce that's grown is often sold in local markets. So it's a great facility.
       </p>

        May I commend the work of president,

        . Without people like them, a great community facility such as the community garden could not go on. There are still sites left, Deputy Speaker. If you feel that you want to turn your hand to gardening, there's a great opportunity at
