        were slogging it out last week in National Party back rooms to work out who was going to be the next Deputy Prime Minister of this country, the small businesses in their electorates were struggling with substandard broadband from a second-rate

They are concerned that over $500 million in regional grants funding is locked up because you guys opposite can't make a decision. It's time for the Prime Minister to step in, stop this farce, sack the Deputy
