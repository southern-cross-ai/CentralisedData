         First of all, I thank the honourable member for her question and for the interest she shows. As I am sure all members of the House will know, after the election of former Prime Minister Snyder Rini on 18 April riots broke out in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         capital, Honiara. I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute not just to the Royal Solomon Islands Police but to the members of the Australian police contingent, as part of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
          RAMSI
         </a>
         , for the enormous courage they showed in that situation. They had very little to defend themselves with, and they showed simply extraordinary courage.
        </p>
        <p>
         As honourable members will also know, very soon after, as the result of a request to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Prime Minister
         </a>
         from both the outgoing and incoming prime ministers of the Solomon Islands, defence and police reinforcements were sent in. They restored order in Honiara, and that order has remained to this day. Two members of the Solomon Islands parliament were amongst those who were arrested and charged for alleged incitement of the riots. This is a most serious charge, and its seriousness cannot be overstated.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Thursday, 4 May, the Solomon Islands parliament elected a new Prime Minister, Mr Sogavare. On 5 May, Mr Sogavare announced that the two members of parliament who are on charges will hold cabinet positions, with one of them to hold the position of minister for police. We are respectful of the sovereignty of the Solomon Islands, but Australia is surprised and deeply concerned by this move. I draw the House’s attention to the fact that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Clark" rel="nofollow">
          Helen Clark
         </a>
         , said yesterday—it might have been the day before yesterday—that she was aghast at the appointments. We have made representations to the Solomon Islands government and have drawn to their attention our concerns. I hope to visit the Solomon Islands soon with the New Zealand foreign minister and possibly other ministers from other Pacific island countries. It will be an opportunity to talk to the Solomon Islands government not just about this issue that I have raised today but also about RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission in Solomon Islands, its role and what it can do.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no doubt that RAMSI has been very successful since it was deployed in July 2003. Over 3,700 weapons have been seized and more than 5,000 arrests have been made. Courts have the capacity now to manage serious criminal and corruption trials, and the Solomon Islands have achieved the highest rates of economic growth at any time since the early 1990s. These achievements have been very warmly welcomed by the people of the Solomon Islands. An important point to make here is that, whatever criticisms there may be of RAMSI from what I might call the political class, the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands very warmly welcome RAMSI and are enormously supportive of RAMSI.
        </p>
        <p>
         But nobody should have any illusions about the size of the task which the Solomon Islands face. Since 2003, the Solomon Islands have achieved average economic growth of over four per cent, but that rate of economic growth would need to continue until 2025 just to reach the 1980 per capita income levels, which is quite a dramatic statistic. This will require enormous commitment to reform, it will require accountability to restore confidence to domestic and international investors and it will certainly demand very good governance. RAMSI can assist but, ultimately, the government and the people of the Solomon Islands are responsible for their own destiny. They must take their destiny into their hands. We are happy to help, but ultimately they will always be responsible for their own future.
