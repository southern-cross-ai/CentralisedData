        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government’s response to developments surrounding Iran’s nuclear program?

         I thank the member for her question. As members would of course appreciate, the danger posed by the spread of nuclear weapons is a grave threat to international peace and security. The human and environmental consequences of the use of these weapons again are too terrible to contemplate. The more states that acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons then, regrettably, the more likely it is that one will be used. Addressing the challenge of nuclear non-proliferation is a key priority for the Australian government, as it is for the international community. Today, unfortunately, the non-proliferation regime is under pressure, including from the destabilising actions of Iran, whose failure to comply with its international obligations has undermined international norms.

         Members would recall that in 2002 Iran was exposed for constructing secret uranium enrichment facilities. Since that time Iran has been found to have been in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
          International Atomic Energy Agency
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA" rel="nofollow">
          IAEA
         </a>
         , and has refused to comply with four binding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         resolutions. The most recent IAEA report, which was on Monday this week, confirmed that Iran continued to ignore its international obligations. The concerns of the international community about Iran’s nuclear intentions were underlined and reinforced by its revelation in September that it had been building another covert uranium enrichment facility near Qom. The IAEA inspected the Qom facility on 26 and 27 October. This initial inspection has raised further questions about the intended purpose of that facility and the timing of its construction. Iran’s failure to declare the Qom facility to the IAEA was not only inconsistent with its obligations to the IAEA but also gives rise to questions as to whether there might be other undeclared such facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The latest report this week from the IAEA comes at a critical time for Iran. Iran has a historic opportunity for fundamental change in its dealings with the international community. The early October talks between Iran and the so-called P5 plus one—the permanent five plus Germany—were a very promising step welcomed by Australia and the international community. At the talks, Iran agreed to consider a proposal drafted by the IAEA under which Iran would transfer a significant proportion of its low-enriched uranium to Russia and France for fabrication into fuel for Iran’s Tehran research reactor. This proposal represented a unique opportunity for Iran to reverse its course from confrontation to cooperation.

         noted in mid-November that he wanted, as did the international community, a positive response from Iran but that time was running out. Australia shares the view that Iran needs to respond not only in a positive manner to that proposal but also in a timely manner. The Australian government fully supports further dialogue between the P5 plus one and Iran on its nuclear program, but neither Australia nor the international community can wait indefinitely. Australia has fully implemented

         sanctions against Iran and members will recall that in October last year I announced in the House the imposition of additional Australian autonomous sanctions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I conclude by reiterating that Iran’s refusal to comply with legally binding United Nations Security Council resolutions is of serious and grave concern to Australia and the international community. Australia remains prepared to contemplate further action in this area. Iran is of course able to assert its right to a peaceful civil nuclear program. But it must carry out its non-proliferation responsibilities, it must carry out its non-proliferation obligations and it must conduct itself in conformity with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
