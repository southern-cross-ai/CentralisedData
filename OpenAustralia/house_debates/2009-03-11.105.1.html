        I rise to speak in support of a petition containing 1,236 signatures from the Sale and district community. By way of background, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Wellington Shire Council
        </a>
        is well advanced in a plan to relocate outdoor netball courts and establish a multisports venue in Sale, at the same time allowing for the relocation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        facilities to a more central location. The plan is multifaceted and each aspect hinges on the successful funding of other stages.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the Gippsland by-election campaign a community rally was attended by several hundred people, and the principal petitioner, Scott Rosetti, did a magnificent job to galvanise public support behind this project. Mr Rosetti has gone on to become a shire councillor and he continues to pursue the issue, as does the rest of the council. It is also worth noting that the Labor candidate in the Gippsland by-election, Councillor Darren McCubbin, is the Wellington Shire Council Mayor and an outspoken advocate of this project. I mean the term ‘outspoken’ quite literally. As a former town crier, Councillor Darren McCubbin has a very powerful voice and he is certainly trumpeting the importance of this project near and far. I understand that a council delegation have met with government ministers and they are hopeful of a positive result. The project is well advanced and has the financial backing of state and local government and needs a commitment from the federal government to proceed to the next stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The benefits of this project are extensive and include the obvious opportunity to encourage more young people in the community, particularly young women, to enjoy a healthy lifestyle. The Sale Netball Association has made an outstanding contribution to the Gippsland community over several decades and hosts its own weekly competitions as well as regional events. The construction of the new courts and an indoor facility will allow the association to take the next step in attracting more high-quality competitions and continuing to cater for local sportswomen. As I mentioned, the project has several aspects. The relocation of netball courts will clear a site for the local TAFE college to be established at a more central location, which has obvious benefits to students accessing courses. The final cog in the wheel is the development of the indoor sports centre, which will allow the relocation of existing sports and free up an excellent site in Palmerston Street, Sale, adjoining the Central Gippsland Health Service, to further improve the health precinct services for the Gippsland community.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many benefits to the Gippsland community that will flow out of a federal government funding commitment to this project. More than 1,200 residents have expressed their view in this petition, and I urge the government to consider the issue as soon as possible. If we are serious about nation building and stimulating economic growth and jobs, here is a project that is ready to roll right now. It is time for the federal government to get fair dinkum about regional infrastructure. We have had 18 months of promises and precious little action on the ground. This project is ready to proceed and will provide a much needed stimulus to the Gippsland economy and long-term social and economic benefits. I congratulate the petitioners and the Wellington Shire Council for their support for this very worthy project and I urge the government to get on board.
