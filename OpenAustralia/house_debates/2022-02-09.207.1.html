       <p>
        One thing I'll never shy away from is the importance of having a job. Not only does employment provide security in life; it also instils a sense of self-worth. It gets us out and about in our community and provides us with ongoing opportunities, and it makes our lives better. It instils pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's no doubt that COVID-19 has put the brakes on our economy and tested employers and workers like never before. But the Morrison government has kept its word to Australia's businesses and their workers. We've promised to guide our economy through the greatest economic shock in 100 years, and we've delivered. Today, the national unemployment rate is at a 13-year low. In the great state of Tasmania there are record numbers of workers employed, and unemployment was at 3.9 per cent in the month of December. Our businesses are the most confident in the nation, and that's exciting, because confident businesses create jobs and drive our economy forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        But our recovery is not without its challenges. Across the north-west, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        , one of the greatest threats we face to our economic recovery is the fact that we have more jobs now than people to fill them. This is something I'm hearing from businesses each and every day. And we're talking about good jobs. We're talking about smart jobs, great employers and wonderful opportunities to get ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Late last year I hosted the Burnie Jobs Fair on the north-west coast. It was the second fair that I'd hosted in the electorate. In Burnie, 439 jobs were on offer, including 21 apprenticeships and traineeships. Whether you are 18 or 68, if you are looking for a job or looking to reskill or upskill, jobs fairs link you directly to employers, as well as to the people who can tell you about the skills that you'll need to get the job of your dreams. I'm determined to remove any barriers that prevent jobseekers from easily and seamlessly making that link with employment opportunities in the region. A major part of that has being rolling out the new Burnie campus of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        and the higher education study hubs in Zeehan and Smithton. A good job starts with good education, and these higher education centres fill the voids that have historically existed within our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I say to every jobseeker in the region: whether you're looking at education or training or, in fact, a great job, there has never been a better time to shape your future for a more positive outcome.
