        My question is to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        . The G20 finance ministers' meeting has noted the potentially serious impacts on growth and stability and the importance of a coordinated international response to the ebola epidemic. Will the Acting Prime Minister outline in specific detail how Australia, as G20 chair, is coordinating this international response?

        <p>
         The role of coordinating the response to ebola rests fundamentally with health organisations, rather than economic forums. The reality is that this government is playing its role in providing financial support and assisting wherever else we can in addressing the outbreak of ebola in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a matter of concern, I think, to all citizens of the world to endeavour to make our people as safe as we possibly can be from an epidemic of this nature. The response needs to be on many fronts. Firstly, addressing the immediate needs of those people who have contracted the disease and to attempt to treat those who have been affected. Then we also need to endeavour to avoid the spread of the disease to other parts of the world. I also think that it is fundamentally important for us to try to address what measures can be taken to develop a cure for this disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think that Australia has a capacity to assist in all of those regards. Recently, the Prime Minister, while on his travel to Indonesia, called into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          New Guinea
         </a>
         to make it clear that we were prepared to assist in the event of there being an outbreak in those countries nearby us. We provided financial support to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Organisation
         </a>
         and others who are involved in the treatment of this particular outbreak. We have also, of course, been talking to other countries about how we may be able to work with them, especially if Australians are to be deployed into this effort.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of Australians are already working in Africa of their own volition. We recognise the danger that they have exposed themselves to and their humanitarian effort in seeking to be a part of that exercise. Minister Bishop has been talking to countries overseas about how we may be able to cooperate with them in the event of us sending volunteers who may have to be evacuated. As the House will be aware, it is some 30 hours flying time from Africa back to Australia and it is incumbent upon any government proposing to place workers in a country that has this disease to ensure that we have an exit strategy, and that we have ways in which people who may become infected are able to come back to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         So our response has been, I think, appropriate in the circumstances. We remain willing and keen to do what we can to assist in every possible way. We are making financial contributions now. I note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         task force has been particularly gratified by the fact that Australia has made a further contribution, which the leader of the task force has identified as being an example to other countries.
