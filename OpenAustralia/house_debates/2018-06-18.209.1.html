        I rise to encourage locals in the city of Albury and nearby Jindera to attend one of two community information sessions being staged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        this week. In this place, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout is often discussed in overcharged political terms and tones. It should also be remembered that for regional Australia the arrival of the network has provided us with a far earlier chance to experience much better broadband options. As Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, and as a country MP with two major regional cities in the middle of connecting, I won't pretend the rollout hasn't had its challenges. But what I have noticed is—amid all the claims of upload and download speeds and delivery objectives—the NBN and its retail service providers becoming more aware that it is real people wanting to connect to the network. Supply and demand of the net has become such a commercial numbers game that the people who deliver the technology sometimes forget the people at the end of the line. When a business owner cannot connect, when a student can't study, when mum and dad can't Skype their family overseas, it's an issue and it needs addressing. I want to acknowledge those involved in the NBN, from management to the technicians on the ground, who already look after all these people, and to encourage others to realise that your business will be a lot better off if you do.
