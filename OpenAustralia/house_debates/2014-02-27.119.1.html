        On Wednesday, 19 February, I hosted an ovarian cancer afternoon 'teal' in my electorate office. I was lucky enough to speak to many women in our community about this very important issue. I had the great pleasure of also meeting Dr Oliver Klein, an oncologist from the oncology unit at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">
         St John
        </a>
        of God Hospital in Berwick. The unit is treating about 20 patients per week, and they have an amazing new facility with five chairs. I congratulate Dr Oliver Klein for his very informative speech and I also congratulate all the medical staff at

        . They are doing an incredible job.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the morning tea we also had a long conversation with Kirsty Rosie, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Ovarian Cancer
        </a>
        Australia ambassador. Kirsty, sadly, lost her sister to ovarian cancer and she gave a very moving address to our guests. In attendance we had Jan Hooper, Joanne Masters, Joy Ablett, Councillor Amanda Stapledon, Councillor Louise Berkelmans, Emma Berelmans, Kay Morland, Bridget Scott, Brittany Shanahan, Venezia Wadsworth, Michelle Coburn, Julie, Jennifer, Adele, Sue, Fiona, Kerri, Collette, Olga Kalweit, Joy Davy, Jeanette Claire, Nina Pletheo, Cary and Melinda. It was a great gathering.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scary thing was the statistics we heard. In 2010, ovarian cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed gynaecological cancer in Australia. Each day in Australia four women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and three women will die from the disease. Ovarian cancer has the lowest survival rate of any women's cancer, and there has been little improvement in survival in the past 20 years. Ovarian cancer is most common in women over 50; however, it can affect women of all ages.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the biggest issues with ovarian cancer is taking note of the symptoms and being able to diagnose properly. Women should watch for symptoms such as abdominal or pelvic pain, increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating, needing to urinate often or urgently, or feeling full after eating a small amountâ€”especially if they are over the age of 50.
       </p>
       <p>
        The causes of ovarian cancer are not known, but research continues in Australia and overseas. There is not one test that can be used to diagnose ovarian cancer. Like many of these terrible diseases, awareness raising for early detection is a critical component to ensure women have the best chances of recovery. As Dr Oliver Klein said, early detection is very important so I strongly recommend to any woman who has those symptoms and is over the age of 50 that she see her doctor.
