        I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the numerous sporting achievements of my constituents in Bass in Northern Tasmania of whom I am very proud. Sport, like other pursuits, plays an integral part in the lives of many in my electorate, and tonight I would like to take this opportunity to officially recognise some of our finest sporting men and women, both amateur and professional.

        our own, to name a few. Yet Northern Tasmania is also the playing ground of thousands of others who enjoy the good health, friendship and lifestyle associated with sport. This year I had the pleasure of visiting numerous sporting clubs and associations around the north and north-east of the great state of Tasmania. I look forward to attending

        However, some of the best occasions that I have witnessed have actually been the end of season celebrations. This year I was proud to present my inaugural award: a trophy featuring, very appropriately, I think, a red kookaburra cricket ball, signed by the Prime Minister—a great cricket tragic—to a number of cricket clubs in Bass. I wanted the award to recognise those who contribute heavily to their club. I would like to congratulate once more Dean Gibbons of the George Town Cricket Club,

        . Tonight I would also like to acknowledge a well-known local identity Mr Jack Hinds, a highly respected umpire in Tasmanian cricket circles with the Tasmanian cricket league, with many years of dedicated service. All of these people are the lifeblood of their individual clubs and associations and very worthy winners indeed. I plan to expand the presentation of this award in the future to other sporting clubs and community groups.

        I turn the attention of the House to another winner in the eyes of the Northern Tasmanian public: well-known businessman, sports lover and thespian Mr Rod Beaumont, who, unfortunately, passed away on 5 June this year. Rod Beaumont was a great family man who cared deeply for those around him. He was a big fellow with a large, generous heart and, to quote his wife, Jenny, ‘His eyes were kind.’ To anybody who met him, he was a very positive man with a wonderful sense of humour. He was also the driving force behind his well-known local company, Jenerick, an icon of Northern Tasmanian business. To his everlasting credit, Rod Beaumont was involved in many aspects of community life in Bass. He was President of Launceston Jaycees; President of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Players" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston Players
        </a>
        , and later a life member; President and patron of Launceston Rugby Club, where I will never forget as an aspiring politician and Liberal candidate, he bought me a beer one Saturday afternoon; an inaugural member of the Lions Club Launceston North; and, an inaugural member of Cityprom and later its president. He was also a candidate for local government, standing for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston City Council
        </a>
        , and a member of the well-renowned Beefsteak and Burgundy Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rod was also very much committed to the Liberal Party. During his formative years he vied for a number of various positions within the party and eventually was rewarded with the state presidency of the Tasmanian Young Liberals and, indeed, even preselection to stand for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         House of Assembly
        </a>
        seat of Bass. He was also made a life member of the Liberal Party of Australia Tasmania Division for his significant contributions. I am told he very much admired former Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gorton" rel="nofollow">
         John Gorton
        </a>
        , and was taken with a quote from his book: ‘He bucked the saddle of convention and conformity,’ and he saw himself in the same light. Rod was an incredibly talented, visionary and friendly big-hearted fellow and he will be missed by many. I am sure that all members present would wish his adoring wife, Jenny, and his twins, Charles and Bridget, all the best during this difficult time. For those who love this family, we join with them and try to understand. But for now, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Rod always thought that Northern Tasmania was the best place on the planet and, of course, I completely agree with him. I thank the House.
