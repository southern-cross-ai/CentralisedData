        My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. What is the reaction of the government to the prospect of another coup in Fiji?

         I thank the member for Fadden for that question. Needless to say—and I imagine that I speak for both sides of the House on this issue—the government would view with very deep concern both the possibility and certainly the actuality of a military coup in Fiji. We are concerned about threats that have been made against the constitutionally elected government by Commodore Frank Bainimarama over the past few days, including last week at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islands Forum
         </a>
         meeting in Suva and, most recently, last night. I conveyed to the Fijian Prime Minister the strong support of the government. I would remind the House that the government in Fiji was returned to office in free and fair elections in May. It has a multiparty cabinet, representing the views of the majority of the Fijian community regardless of race. Any illegal or unconstitutional action against the Fijian government by the military would severely damage not only the international reputation of Fiji but also its economy, especially its booming tourism sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         I told the Prime Minister last night that Australia strongly supported the duly and democratically elected government of Fiji. Separately, it has been made clear on behalf of Australia directly to Commodore Bainimarama on a number of occasions—and most recently in the last 24 hours—that the proper role of the military in a democracy is to respect and support the properly elected government. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston spoke yesterday to the Commodore and reiterated those views. We in the government would view any extraconstitutional moves in Fiji with the utmost seriousness. We are taking steps to be prepared to respond appropriately to possible developments.

         I spoke last night to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand Prime Minister
         </a>
         , who shares the views that I am now expressing to the Australian parliament, and yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to Mr Greg Irwin, the Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, about possible regional responses. There are contingency plans in place to respond to any consular emergency. Naval vessels are being prepared to help with the evacuation of Australians if that should prove necessary and current travel advice recommends that Australians exercise caution. I do ask Australians intending to visit Fiji to monitor the advisory very closely. The situation is uncertain and could deteriorate quite rapidly without warning.
