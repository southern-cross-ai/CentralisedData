       <p>
        Last week I met with a constituent,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Green" rel="nofollow">
         Derek Green
        </a>
        , to discuss the importance of electrical safety, training and awareness. Derek runs a small business that operates as a registered training organisation. He is really making a difference in electrical safety through education, support and compliance. Derek has over 34 years experience in the electrical industry, so he really knows what is talking about when it comes to electrical safety. Derek felt compelled to come and see me after witnessing a recent surge in electrical safety incidents. Many of these events have resulted in significant physical injury to those involved, and in Derek's view many of the incidents could easily have been avoided if adequate education and training had been provided.
       </p>
       <p>
        More can and should be done to improve the safety of workers, when it comes to working dealing with electricity. We know that. Derek spoke to me about his belief that the current electrical safety training programs for most workers are in his view either inadequate or nonexistent. Derek advised me of his particular concern about the minimal training that is given to apprentices in the construction industry as they begin to learn their trade. We need to make sure that these workers are given the right information so that they can come home safe at the end of every workday.
       </p>
       <p>
        But electrical incidents are not just confined to the construction industry. Derek has recently witnessed accidents right across a range of industries, including agriculture, transport, arboriculture and civil works. It is important that workers in every single industry are taught about the dangers of electricity. A worker has the best chance of being safe when they are fully aware of the dangers that surround them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing that Derek raised with me was around education for school leavers. Workplace safety is a topic that he is really passionate about. It is his hope that year 12 students are provided with some form of workplace training. Many of these school leavers are preparing to enter the workforce for the first time, and he really believes that training of this type would be incredibly valuable. From our conversation, I made a commitment to Derek that I will work with our state members of parliament in the electorate to look at how a program could be run out at a local level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Young people can have a really positive impact on their workplaces with their confidence and their sense of infallibility. However, these traits can also lead to issues around workplace safety. Workplace safety is not just a responsibility of the employer but also of the employee. We need to educate our young workers to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others. We need to teach them that one mistake, especially with electricity, could mean severe injury or potentially worse.
