       <p>
        I rise to recognise the achievements of Andrew Tanner from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfoyle_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Aberfoyle Park
        </a>
        in my electorate. Andrew has faced many challenges in his life. He was born with two holes in his heart. During the surgery to repair those holds, Andrew suffered a stroke that caused him to become intellectually disabled. When Andrew was five, he was diagnosed with velocardiofacial syndrome. When he was eight, Andrew started riding with the local Riding for the Disabled Australia in Blackwood. Over the last 19 years, he has become an accomplished rider. Last year, he was selected to the Special Olympics Australian team and became the first male competitor to represent Australia in equestrian.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 25 July to 2 August this year, 76 Aussie athletes wore the green and gold with pride in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" rel="nofollow">
         Los Angeles
        </a>
        at the Special Olympics World Summer Games. Our team competed alongside 7,000 athletes from 177 countries. Andrew represented his country very well. In his first attempt at the games, he won both a gold and a bronze medal in his events. This is an incredible achievement which has required years of dedication, hard work and support from family and friends. Congratulations, Andrew. I believe I can speak for our local community when I say that we are very proud of you.
