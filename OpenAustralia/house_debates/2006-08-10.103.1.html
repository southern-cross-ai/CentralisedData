        In recent weeks I attended an official function at

        in the Calliope shire near Gladstone. It was celebrating the unveiling of a plaque to St Francis and the announcement of stage 2 of the school’s development. St Francis school is renowned for caring for students’ development, and it is fitting that St
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi" rel="nofollow">
         Francis of Assisi
        </a>
        should be the school’s patron saint. The legacy of St Francis was his gift of sympathy and love of nature and animals, a motto which provides direction and inspiration to all who work at the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the very beginning of the planning of the school, for example, the example of Francis of Assisi, with his love of God and all creation, has been the guiding principle. The sculpture of St Francis and his beloved animals was a gift from the diocesan Catholic Education Office in Rockhampton and now sits proudly at the school’s entrance as a focal point for the school. The setting is also consistent with the spirit of St Francis, being built in rather thick bushland, complete with kangaroos and birds. I sometimes go to mass there. In the old days before the school was built the kangaroos used to come up to the windows of the church. It was quite a moving experience. In this redevelopment, which the Commonwealth is contributing $2.4 million to, we are going to put in a general learning area, provision for an interim library, a half-covered basketball court area, pupil amenities, a physical education amenity, preparatory amenities, car parking, furniture and equipment.
       </p>

        St Francis School opened in 2005 with 124 students. Enrolments now stand at over 200. Stage 2 will enable the school to continue meeting the demands of quality Christian based education. It will also give the people of the Tannum Sands area a choice in the education of their children. There is a very real sense of community at the school, and I am very proud of its achievements over this first 12 months. I congratulate the parish priest,

        , one of my favourite pastors; Principal Andy Nicholls and his staff; the diocesan director of Catholic education, Leesa Jeffcoat; and all the parents who have provided unswerving support for the school. In this day and age it has never been more appropriate that children be brought up with the message of St Francis firmly implanted in their psyches: make me an instrument of your peace.
