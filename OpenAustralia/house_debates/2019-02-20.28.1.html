        This Liberal government really has no clue. They're so out of touch, it is unbelievable. Yesterday, we learnt that the Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance and the Public Service, has the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Helloworld on speed dial. That CEO also just so happens to be the Liberal Party treasurer. Helloworld just so happens to have a $1 billion contract with this Liberal government and—wouldn't you know it—when Minister Cormann called up the CEO to book a family holiday, it was never charged to his credit card.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's take a look at a few angles here. First of all, who calls the CEO of a travel company to book a holiday? Does the minister also call the CEO of Dominos to order a pizza? Secondly, how do you not notice that $2,700 for travel hasn't been charged to your credit card? I can tell you for sure that the people of Cowan would notice a few extra thousand dollars in their accounts. Lastly, Minister Cormann has called this financial glitch a 'mistake'—yet another 'administrative error'. Well, phew, now I can rest easy—considering his entire job is to manage the finances and administration of our nation! The finance minister is an embarrassment. The government have just given up. They're chaotic; they're divided and they're out of touch. Enough is enough—time is up for this government.
