        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answer. Given his admission that he complained privately to the ABC, given evidence that the story was dropped because of concerns by the Turnbull camp, and given concerns that the coalition has about bias at the ABC, will he conduct an independent inquiry into this, just like he did about Q&amp;A?

          My understanding from reading about this in the media, as I am sure the honourable member has done also, is that there was an employment issue between a journalist at the ABC and a manager in which the employee had tape recorded a discussion with his manager. His contentions were rejected by the ABC management. The answer I gave a moment ago was not directed to any particular story of the journalist concerned. I do not recall the article that was apparently the subject of the taped discussion. I simply made the point that, in respect of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
           ABC's
          </a>
          coverage of the

           NBN
          </a>
          issue—and this was essentially in the lead-up to the last election, so this predates my being a minister—my view was, and I am entitled to have that view, as we are all entitled to have a view about news reporting, that they could have done a more comprehensive job and taken a more balanced approach in which they made a better effort of explaining the arguments about the competing technologies. That was, if you like, the factual context in the NBN broadband debate at the time: is fibre-to-the-node worthwhile; does it deliver adequate speeds; is fibre-to-the-premises the only way to go? In many respects, the debate has been resolved. The evidence is in. The multitechnology mix that the government is taking has been proven to be correct.

             I am not about to run a commentary on particular articles on the ABC. All of us have had plenty to say about the ABC. I have had plenty to say about the ABC on the ABC, as the honourable member knows. So, yes, I certainly did complain and felt that their coverage could have been more comprehensive, as I described. I think it could have done a better job at informing the Australian people about the technology choices. But, as for the rights and wrongs of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ross" rel="nofollow">
              Nick Ross
             </a>
             , who I think is the journalist the honourable member mentioned, or indeed,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Alberici" rel="nofollow">
              Emma Alberici
             </a>
             , those are matters between the ABC management and the journalists in question. They are matters for them to resolve through the normal industrial processes. The honourable member should recognise that, in the free and open debate we have, all of us are entitled to express our views about the coverage of issues in the media and all of us should continue to do so. The honourable member's attempt to suggest that somehow there is something untoward in complaining about coverage on the ABC does him a disservice. We are having a free and open discussion here on these big matters and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
              ABC's
             </a>
             coverage is entitled to be a subject of criticism, as are the people on whom it seeks to report.
