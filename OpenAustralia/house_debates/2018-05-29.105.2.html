        On Anzac Day this year, I was very pleased to attend again the Coloured Diggers march in Redfern to honour Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

        war veterans, service men and women. It was the 12th year that we had had the Coloured Diggers march in Redfern, and I congratulate all of those who were involved in organising this very important and significant local event. A bit more than 12 years ago now, the event started very humbly in

        working with people in the local community to acknowledge the often-overlooked contribution of Indigenous service personnel. Each year we've seen this ceremony grow, and this year we saw a fantastic celebration, with the Governor there and other very substantial contributions from dignitaries from around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those I was particularly pleased to see acknowledged was the Redfern local area commander of the

        </a>
        . At this year's march, it was very obvious to me that Superintendent Luke Freudenstein has the deep trust, respect and affection of our local Redfern and Waterloo Aboriginal communities. It's so sad to say then, tonight, that Superintendent Freudenstein is retiring after 37 years in the New South Wales Police Force, including 10 years as the commander at Redfern. His last day will be Friday, 8 June. He'll be marched out of Redfern Police Station—I believe that's not what happens to you at the end of the night in the bar; I believe it is an official thing that they do in the New South Wales police!—to the sound of bagpipes. I'm delighted that I'll be going out to the marching-out ceremony and to the dinner afterwards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Superintendent Freudenstein's community policing work has brought the Redfern police area command into a new era, and it's brought our community to a turning point in relations between the police and the local community. It's very clear, from Superintendent Freudenstein's involvement with Babana men's group, the Redfern All Blacks football club, the junior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League
        </a>
        football association and programs with the Tribal Warrior Association, amongst others, that his dedication and the difference that he's making, not just during his working hours but in his own time, have really been second to none.
       </p>
       <p>
        His approach to the Redfern area is unique. He has worked so closely with programs like Clean Slate Without Prejudice and the bush boot camp program, co-founded with Redfern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAC" rel="nofollow">
         PAC
        </a>
        and the Tribal Warrior Association. It's actually making a difference on the ground. We're seeing lower crime rates and lower rates of recidivism. The proof really is there. In particular, the Clean Slate Without Prejudice program is so simple. It focuses on discipline and routine in the lives of young people through boxing training, keeping young people out of prison and giving them positive role models.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second phase of the program, Never Going Back, involves working with inmates to give them hope, again through boxing training, making sure that they never go back to prison. Part of the program also assists people in attaining their commercial boating licence. The bush boot camp assists young local Indigenous kids with potential who aren't involved in other local programs. It gives them support to retain their commitment to their schoolwork and sports and so on. It gives them great mentors, making sure that they get on the right track for success.
       </p>
       <p>
        It took Superintendent Freudenstein a decade to foster the level of trust and cooperation we see in our local community, but it has really paid off in the relationships that we see locally. At the Coloured Diggers march this year, the elders in Babana men's group and the local Indigenous community honoured Luke Freudenstein for his incredible commitment to the area, and I'm pleased to be able to join with them to acknowledge his fantastic work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've written to both the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Mick Fuller, and to the police minister, Troy Grant, to ask them if they could convince Superintendent Freudenstein to stay. They tell me that almost 40 years in the police force is probably enough for anyone! But we will miss him very, very sorely. It's no wonder that the Police Force recognised Luke Freudenstein's work this year by awarding him the prestigious
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        in the honours list in 2013. While I'm so sad to see Superintendent Freudenstein go, I'm very hopeful that the New South Wales Police Force will find a suitable replacement for all his good work.
