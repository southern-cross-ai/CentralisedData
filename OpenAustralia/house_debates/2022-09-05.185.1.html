        The harmonisation of abortion laws across Australia is overdue. As a first step, revision of Medicare numbers would enable better access and better data on terminations.

        n women are subject to some of the most restrictive laws in the country. In some circumstances, they need to travel thousands of kilometres to access abortion. They're uprooted, alone and financially disadvantaged when at their most vulnerable.

        In Western Australia, abortion is still in the criminal code and there's limited access to terminations through the public health system. The choice to have a termination after 20 weeks doesn't belong to the pregnant woman and her healthcare provider but rather to an ethics panel of six people appointed by the health minister. A doctor living in my electorate gave me some examples of the impact of this issue on women's lives. Fiona had serious mental health problems and was living in a violent relationship with a partner who prevented her from having an earlier termination. She was denied a termination by the panel and couldn't travel because of COVID. She had the baby and continued to be trapped in that relationship. Alina had eclampsia at 22 weeks and was having uncontrolled seizures. Termination of her pregnancy was delayed while applying to the panel, placing her life at risk. Anh's baby was diagnosed with a significant genetic disorder, but the ethics panel decided she was not permitted to discontinue the pregnancy. She then had to travel to Victoria for the procedure. The federal government has a responsibility to ensure all Australian women have equal access to safe abortion care
