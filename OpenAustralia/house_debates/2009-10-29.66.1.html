        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the following remarks made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Howes" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Howes
        </a>
        , the National Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        and a member of the government’s Future Manufacturing Industry Innovation Council. He is reported as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We’re talking about (78) people on a boat. When you compare that to 50,000 visa overstayers, I reckon a lot of those visa overstayers are white …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And I reckon there’s not much concern about those visa overstayers because they are white.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Prime Minister agree with me that the implication that Australians are racist is offensive? Will he disassociate himself from those remarks?

           I am just saying I have not seen his remarks. I am being completely straight with you. I have not seen what he said. It does not surprise me what the given individual might be saying in any public policy debate on any given day. He has a habit of expressing his views in his own way.
          </p>
          <p>
           My own view is that in Australia there is a strong, fundamental tradition of racial tolerance and inclusion, of which all Australians are proud. It is not my view that there is a racist sentiment in the Australian society. It is my view that this country is built on a culture of tolerance—one which embraces our neighbours; one which seeks to include people from different ethnic origins; one which seeks to embrace properly, through our orderly refugee program. It is a culture in which we can say to those who come here from offshore: your future in this country can be part of the nation-building program of Australia’s 21st century. Ours is a nation which brings all peoples from the world together in one and forges our one Australia. That is the one that I believe in.
