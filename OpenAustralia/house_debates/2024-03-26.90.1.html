        It gives me great pleasure to table this treaty today. This is the most significant agreement between Australia and one of its Pacific partners since the agreement for Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975. It will elevate the relationship between Australia and Tuvalu to a deep and comprehensive partnership, a true partnership between friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Falepili' is a Tuvaluan word for good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect. These are the values that are embodied in this treaty. Respect and support for each other's sovereignty are at the heart of our Falepili Union. It puts in place transformational arrangements to safeguard the future of Tuvalu's people, identity and culture and to advance Australia's interests in a peaceful and secure Pacific. The Australian government negotiated this treaty in response to a gracious request from the government of Tuvalu. We were honoured to respond to that request and I am honoured to present the treaty to the House today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty seeks to safeguard Tuvalu's future in the face of the existential threat of climate change, and it recognises that Tuvalu's statehood will continue notwithstanding the impacts of climate-related sea-level rise. The treaty is consistent with Pacific solutions to regional security challenges, as agreed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands Forum
        </a>
        . Under this treaty, both Australia and Tuvalu are embracing obligations to achieve our shared interests. The new government of Tuvalu has confirmed its desire to proceed with the Falepili Union. Tuvalu's Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feleti_Teo" rel="nofollow">
         Feleti Teo
        </a>
        , was an important contributor to the development of this transformational arrangement and I pay my respects to him and his cabinet. Prime Minister Feleti has been clear he will consult with his people, and we'll work closely with Tuvalu to ensure sovereignty is respected as we move to implement this treaty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tuvalu is a low-lying island state at the front lines of the global climate crisis. Tuvalu's 11,000 people hold deep ancestral connections to land and sea, and that is why Australia will provide climate adaptation support to help Tuvalu's people continue to live and thrive in their territory. This treaty is based on respect for the inherent dignity of Tuvalu and its people. We believe that people of Tuvalu deserve the choice to live, study and work in Australia, and that's we will establish a special mobility pathway to Australia with an initial allocation for 280 people a year. The pathway will allow Tuvaluans to send remittances, diversify livelihoods and acquire new skills. This will strengthen community resilience in Tuvalu. Tuvaluans will be able to move between Australia and Tuvalu based on the principle of mobility with dignity. In doing this, we support Tuvalu's sovereignty. We consider Tuvalu has shown great regard for future generations in driving this union.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of this elevated partnership, Australian and Tuvalu will also deepen security cooperation. This recognises that, as Pacific countries, our interests are intertwined. Under this treaty, Australia commits to assist Tuvalu in responding to a major natural disaster, a health pandemic or military aggression. This is predicated on Tuvalu requesting such assistance. To enable effective operation of the treaty, Tuvalu will mutually agree third-party security or defence arrangements with Australia. This agreement will be achieved through friendly consultation and frank and honest dialogue in the spirit of Falepili. The Falepili Union demonstrates to Tuvalu and, indeed, the wider Pacific region that Australia is a genuine and reliable partner. When we say we are part of the Pacific family, this is what we mean. We share a region, an ocean and a future. I commend this treaty to the House.
