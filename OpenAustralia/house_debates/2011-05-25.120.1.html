       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge the state visit by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Cyprus" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Republic of Cyprus
        </a>
        , His Excellency Mr Demetris Christofias, to Australia. He arrived today for a five-day official visit. This visit is highly significant for both Cypriot and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Australians
        </a>
        . On behalf of the community I would like to extend to him a warm welcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        The visit is a wonderful opportunity for all Cypriot and Greek Australians, as it represents the strengthening of the rich people-to-people bonds which exist between our nations. I acknowledge the significance of this visit for the enhancement of the very friendly bilateral relationship between the Republic of Cyprus and the Commonwealth of Australia. The vibrant relationship is characterised by strong and enduring bonds of friendship and of cooperation and it is underpinned by people-to-people links. Both countries share common values such as respect for democratic principles, human rights and the law, and of course Australia and Cyprus cooperate in many international fora such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        and the Commonwealth. It is very important that we recognise the continuing, untiring efforts and the positive contribution that His Excellency Mr Christofias has made for the reunification of Cyprus in the framework of the agreed basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship and a single international personality, which is important for any nation, and a settlement in accordance with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Security Council
        </a>
        resolutions on Cyprus and the principles on which the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        is founded, because the Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU. All these things safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has an interest within the region and global interests as well. We have an interest in contributing to and further playing an active role in multilateral fora such as the United Nations and the Commonwealth. We recognise the importance of upholding their principles, including those enshrined in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Charter. Australia thus follows with interest the developments that take place on the Cyprus issue, recognising the importance of reaching a just and lasting agreed settlement.
       </p>
       <p>
        A significant number of my constituents in the electorate of Hindmarsh in South Australia are of Cypriot descent. They make an invaluable contribution to the multicultural spirit of our society, which I am sure is recognized by everyone in this House. The visit of the President of the Republic of Cyprus today underlines the positive role of Cypriot Australians in the communities in all of our electorates, and it is underpinned by Cyprus's genuine desire to further upgrade this relationship. As a member of the Australia-Cyprus Parliamentary Friendship Group, I assure this House that we will continue to play a role in fostering the relationship. We are hosting a breakfast tomorrow morning for the president and for members of all political parties who are members of the Australia-Cyprus Parliamentary Friendship Group to welcome the president and Mrs Christofias to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        During his time in Australia, the president will be travelling to my home state of South Australia where he will meet with the Cypriot community and will lay a foundation stone at the community's new cultural centre, which I am very pleased to say is in the suburb of West Hindmarsh in the electorate Hindmarsh. The function tomorrow night will be hosted by the president of the South Australian Cypriot community, Mr Chris Ioannou, who I know actually lives in the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">

        . I am very pleased to see the member for Port Adelaide,

        and will be at a function with the Governor-General tonight, which unfortunately I will not be able to attend because we are here in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a true honour to host the president in my home state of South Australia tomorrow, where the Cypriot community will this year be celebrating its 63rd anniversary. In my electorate of Hindmarsh alone, there are well over 2,000 people who identify themselves as Cypriot Australians. It is an extremely strong and supportive community and I know that the whole community is absolutely delighted that the president is taking the time to visit not only Australia but also South Australia. We look forward to having him there.
