        I take this opportunity today to honour one of the stalwarts of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder community: Lorna Mitchell nee Bell. Lorna was born in Kunanalling in July 1913 and went to school in Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. She married Rex Mitchell in 1934 and, when he passed away in 1985, Lorna continued to support Rex's well-known contribution to football. She began presenting the Mitchell Medal at the Goldfields Football League's best and fairest competition awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lorna was instrumental in establishing and working with countless community groups, including the Goldfields Repertory Club, the Goldfields Women's Health Care Centre and the Goldfields Child Care Centre and was involved with the Police and Aboriginal Community Relations Committee, Goldfields aged welfare and the

        </a>
        . She also helped to establish a financial advisory referral association—FARA—for families in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1969 she was the first woman elected to the Kalgoorlie Town Council, and later became deputy mayor. Mrs Mitchell received an Order of Australia medal in 1996 and was a recipient of the

        </a>
        . She was also the first administrator of the spring festival when it began in 1985. On 9 October 2014, just four days before the 29th spring festival, Lorna passed away at the incredible age of 102. Unfortunately, Lorna did not get to see the biggest spring festival to date, with over 10,000 spectators coming through the gate and raising $5,000 for the

        through the generous donations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Goldfields Spring Festival was established to provide a platform for the public to celebrate all that is spring in the Goldfields. This annual community event is now coordinated by the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and

        </i>
        all proud partners of this family-oriented event. After 25 years the Goldfields Spring Festival is one institution that has stood the test of time. Stallholders come from all over the state to participate in the festival, along with varying acts of entertainment throughout the day. This year I was able to bring my wife, Tanya, and our four children to Kalgoorlie to attend the Goldfields Spring Festival. It was a great day where the kids were able to have their faces painted, watch talent quests and spend the day looking at the wonderful stalls and displays. As a moving tribute to Lorna, from now on the Goldfields Spring Festival will be named the Lorna Mitchell Goldfields Spring Festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people live a long life but not all continue to contribute to their community throughout their entire lives, as Lorna did. Congratulations to the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry on honouring a deserving woman and on producing a spring festival the whole community can be proud of.
