        I rise today to speak about some concerning news yesterday about the North-South Corridor infrastructure project, which, in 2015, then Prime Minister Mr Abbott promised that it would be completed between 2023 and 2025. Yesterday in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        documents were leaked regarding a press conference by the shadow minister for infrastructure,

        . The documents that were leaked by members of the state Liberal government showed that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        upgrade, in my electorate, may not be completed until possibly 2035â€”a decade later than was promised by the then Prime Minister. This means that we could experience five federal election and four

        before the South Road upgrade is completed. This also means greater uncertainty for businesses, residents, church groups, schools and others in the community. People are left in limbo at a time when business confidence is at an all-time low. We know this project will create approximately 3,000 jobs, and it's desperately needed infrastructure for South Australia and Adelaide. These delays will continue to hold a cloud over the future of Thebarton.

        Premier Marshall and the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , need to be upfront with the people of South Australia instead of dodging the questions I've written to them both on a number of occasions. They need to come clean and confirm when the South Road upgrade will be completed and how, because we need these jobs now and clarity now, not in 15 years.
