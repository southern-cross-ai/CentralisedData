        You would think the member for Dunkley was still the Minister for

        ! But, of course, he is still a good advocate. Bring him back! But while there has been a significant reshuffle on the government benches, there has also been a reshuffle on the opposition benches. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both the member for Oxley and Senator McLucas for the sterling efforts that they have put in, in terms of their shadow portfolio areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        With their resignation from the frontbench we have had a significant new injection of talent on our side of the parliament. Two new women have been promoted to shadow cabinet: Senator Gallagher and the member for Greenway. They have excellent talent and are fierce fighters for their communities and they will be fierce in their portfolios. We have also had a number of other promotions, and I would like to congratulate all of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the opposition benches we are fighting to ensure that our positive ideas are promoted in the community. We have a whole range of positive policies for the future. This is in stark contrast to the government that is flailing around with no new ideas, pursuing the old playbook of $100,000 degrees and all the other cuts to families. We will continue on this side of the House to pursue our positive policy with a new team. I would like to congratulate the opposition leader for his very good promotions.
