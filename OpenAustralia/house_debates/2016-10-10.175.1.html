       <p>
        Yesterday I had the enormous pleasure of attending the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove" rel="nofollow">
         Lane Cove
        </a>
        Village Fair in my electorate. This is a major annual event which attracts thousands of people from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_North_Shore" rel="nofollow">
         Lower North Shore
        </a>
        to come together to reinforce and reflect on the incredible sense of community that exists in the Lane Cove municipality. In fact, there were something like 100 stalls representing community groups and local businesses, and 22,000 people attended on a glorious spring day in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event is organised by Lane Cove Rotary in conjunction with Lane Cove Council, and I want to pay tribute to the Mayor of Lane Cove, Deborah Hutchens, and all her team for the support that they give to Rotary. But I particularly want to congratulate Lane Cove Rotary on the outstanding job that they do in organising such a major event in our community. I should acknowledge the joint presidents of Lane Cove Rotary, Tania Mace and Margaret Silink, for their extraordinary leadership in organising an event such as this. For me it reflects the best of Rotary, which is an organisation that I have been proud to be part of for many years, including for the last 12 months as the president of my own local Rotary club.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my own electorate, we have 10 Rotary clubs. All of them have a unique character, but they are all united by the spirit of service that reflects Rotary's history over the last 110 years. I commend Rotary as an organisation that plays such a vital role in supporting our community and I encourage residents in my own electorate to get involved in an organisation that is about serving others.
