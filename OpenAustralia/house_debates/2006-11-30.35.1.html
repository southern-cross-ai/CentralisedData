        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I will make a brief comment about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
         Black Hawk
        </a>
        accident. I am sure all members join with me in extending our sympathy and support to the family and friends that have been affected by this tragedy off the coast of Fiji late yesterday afternoon. I was deeply saddened to learn of the accident involving a Black Hawk helicopter on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Kanimbla
        </i>
        . The helicopter was taking part in a training exercise when it attempted to land on the deck of the
        <i>
         Kanimbla
        </i>
        and was lost into the sea. One person has lost his life, one serviceman remains missing and seven others have sustained serious injuries. The search for the missing serviceman is continuing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of these servicemen. It is a salient reminder to us all that the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and their families live with the knowledge that they put themselves in harm’s way to serve our country and to help our people. The personnel aboard HMAS
        <i>
         Kanimbla
        </i>
        are preparing and training so that they can provide support to Australian citizens, and I think I can speak on behalf of all Australians in saying that we are certainly proud of the work the ADF does on our behalf and we are always respectful of the sacrifices made by our servicemen and servicewomen.

         Could I have your indulgence, Mr Speaker, on the same sad matter in support of the remarks by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Acting Prime Minister
         </a>
         . I too, on behalf of the opposition, extend our sympathies to the families of the Australian soldiers involved in yesterday’s tragic
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
          Black Hawk
         </a>
         helicopter crash. We pray for the families of the soldier who died and those who are injured. We pray too for the missing soldier that he will be found. It is a tragic loss. It reminds us that whenever our servicemen and servicewomen are in Iraq, Afghanistan,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

         , the Solomons and the waters off Fiji it is a dangerous and inevitable part of the job. It reminds us too of the burden on their families. They are torn between the enormous pride they feel and the fear they live with every day. I am sure it is the same for the families of the four aircrew from Townsville’s 5th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Aviation Regiment
         </a>
         and the six
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">

         personnel on board the Black Hawk serving their country with great skill, courage and professionalism—the pride of their families. Yesterday their families’ hidden fears were made real. Today they grieve and we mourn with them.
