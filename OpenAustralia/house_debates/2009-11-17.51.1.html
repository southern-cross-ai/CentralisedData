        taken to have made a transitional pay equity order to continue the effect of State pay equity orders
       </p>
       <p>
        (1)    On the Division 2B referral commencement, FWA is taken to have made an order (the
        <b>
         <i>
          transitional pay equity order
         </i>

        ) under this item.
       </p>
       <p>
        (2)    Thetransitional pay equity order applies to an employer if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    a modern award applies to the employer on or after the Division 2B referral commencement; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the employer is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, or is included in a class of employers prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)    immediately before the Division 2B referral commencement, a transitional award (the
        <b>
         <i>
          relevant transitional award
         </i>
        </b>
        ) applied to the employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note:
        <b>
         <i>
          Transitional award

         WR
        </a>
        Act. Schedule 6 is continued in operation by Schedule 20 to this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        (3)    An employer must not be prescribed by regulations for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) unless:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    an order, decision or determination of a State industrial body (the
        <b>
         <i>
          source pay equity order
         </i>
        </b>
        ) would have applied to the employer if the relevant transitional award had not applied to the employer; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the source pay equity order satisfies subitem (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        (4)    A source pay equity ordersatisfies this subitem if it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    was made before 15 September 2009; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    provided for increases in rates of pay payable to a particular class of employees (whether the increases were expressed to take effect before, on or after the Division 2B referral commencement); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)    was made wholly or partly on the ground of work value, pay equity or equal remuneration (however described); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d)    is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.
       </p>
       <p>
        (5)    If the transitional pay equity order applies to an employer, the employer is required to pay to each affected employee of the employer a base rate of pay, in respect of a period, that is not less than the base rate of pay that the employee would have been entitled to be paid if the source pay equity order had applied to the employer in respect of the period.
       </p>
       <p>
        (6)    An employee of an employer to which this item applies is an
        <b>
         <i>
          affected employee
         </i>
        </b>
        of the employer if the employee performs work of a kind, at a classification level (however described), in relation to which the source pay equity order determines a base rate of pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        (7)    The transitional pay equity order takes effect in relation to the employer immediately after the modern award begins to apply to the employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        (8)    A term of a modern award is of no effect to the extent that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    an employee is entitled to be paid by an employer a base rate of pay under the transitional pay equity order in respect of a particular period; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the term of the modern award requires the employer to pay a base rate of pay, in respect of that period, that is less than the base rate of pay referred to in paragraph (a).
       </p>
       <p>
        (9)    However, to avoid doubt, a term of a modern award continues to have effect so far as it requires an employer to pay a base rate of pay, in respect of a period, that is equal to or more than the base rate of pay referred to in paragraph (8)(a).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8)    Schedule 2, item 54, page 40 (after line 30), after subitem 8(2), insert:
       </p>
       <p>
        (2A) However, if the term provides for disputes relating to matters arising under the source agreement to be settled by a State industrial body, then, despite anything in the source agreement or a law of the source State:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    the State industrial body may settle, or decline to settle, such a dispute; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    FWA may settle such a dispute if the State industrial body:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)    ceases to exist; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)    declines to settle the dispute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9)    Schedule 2, item 54, page 54 (after line 2), after Division 1, insert:

       </p>
       <p>
        30A

 FWA taken to have made a transitional pay equity order to continue the effect of State pay equity orders
       </p>
       <p>
        (1)    On the Division 2B referral commencement, FWA is taken to have made an order (the
        <b>
         <i>
          transitional pay equity order
         </i>
        </b>
        ) under this item.
       </p>
       <p>
        (2)    The transitional pay equity order applies to an employer if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    a Division 2B State award that applies to the employer terminates at a time (the
        <b>
         <i>
          termination time
         </i>
        </b>
        ) after the Division 2B referral commencement; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the base rate of pay payable immediately before the termination time to some or all of the employees to whom the Division 2B State award applied was determined in whole or part by, or in accordance with, an order, decision or determination (the
        <b>
         <i>
          source pay equity order
         </i>
        </b>
        ) of a State industrial body that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)    was made before 15 September 2009; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)    provided for increases in rates of pay payable to a particular class of employees (whether the increases were expressed to take effect before, on or after the Division 2B referral commencement); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii)    was made wholly or partly on the ground of work value, pay equity or equal remuneration (however described); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)    immediately after the termination time, a modern award applies to the employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note:                After the Division 2B referral commencement, a source pay equity order may have effect either because of subitem 3(3) of this Schedule, or because the terms of the source pay equity order had been incorporated in the source award from which the Division 2B State award was derived.
       </p>
       <p>
        (3)    If the transitional pay equity order applies to an employer, the employer is required to pay to each affected employee of the employer a base rate of pay, in respect of a period, that is not less than the base rate of pay that the employee would have been entitled to be paid under the Division 2B State award in respect of that period, assuming that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    the Division 2B State award had not terminated; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the base rate of pay had continued to be determined in whole or part by, or in accordance with, the source pay equity order in respect of that period.
       </p>
       <p>
        (4)    An employee of an employer to which this item applies is an
        <b>
         <i>
          affected employee
         </i>
        </b>
        of the employer if:

       <p class="italic">
        (a)    all of the following conditions are satisfied:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)    the employee was employed by the employer at the termination time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)    the Division 2B State award applied to the employee at the termination time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii)    the employee’s base rate of pay under the Division 2B State award was determined in whole or part by, or in accordance with, the source pay equity order at the termination time; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    all of the following conditions are satisfied:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)    the employee becomes employed by the employer after the termination time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)    a Division 2B State award would have applied to the employee if he or she had been employed by the employer immediately before the termination time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii)    the employee’s base rate of pay under the Division 2B State award would have been determined in whole or part by, or in accordance with, the source pay equity order at the termination time.
       </p>
       <p>
        (5)    The transitional pay equity order takes effect in relation to the employer immediately after the modern award begins to apply to the employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        (6)    A term of a modern award is of no effect to the extent that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    an employee is entitled to be paid by an employer a base rate of pay under the transitional pay equity order in respect of a particular period; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the term of the modern award requires the employer to pay a base rate of pay, in respect of that period, that is less than the base rate of pay referred to in paragraph (a).
       </p>
       <p>
        (7)    However, to avoid doubt, a term of a modern award continues to have effect so far as it requires an employer to pay a base rate of pay, in respect of a period, that is equal to or more than the base rate of pay referred to in paragraph (6)(a).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (10)  Schedule 2, item 56, page 73 (lines 13 to 18), omit subitem 16(5), substitute:
       </p>
       <p>
        (5)    If, had an employee’s employment been terminated for redundancy (however described) before the Division 2B referral commencement, a State industrial body could have made an order giving the employee an entitlement to redundancy pay (however described):
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment referred to in subitem (4) are taken to have provided for an entitlement to redundancy pay; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    paragraph 121(1)(b) of the FW Act does not apply in relation to the employee during the period of 12 months starting on the Division 2B referral commencement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note:                Because of paragraph (b), the employee may therefore be entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 of the FW Act if the employee’s employment is terminated during the 12 month period starting on the Division 2B referral commencement, even if the employer is a small business employer.
