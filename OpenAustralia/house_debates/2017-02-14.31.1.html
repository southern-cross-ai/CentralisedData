        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government's responsible energy policies will help hardworking Australian families and businesses access more affordable and reliable power, which is something of great concern to constituents in my electorate of Robertson?

              Jay Weatherill
             </a>
             called his 'great experiment'. Well, it is an experiment that has failed. It has failed workers; it has failed businesses; and it has failed households. The chairman, Colin Goodall, said: 'Power has become a daily conversation in South Australia. It is difficult to attract new businesses to South Australia due to electricity being unreliable.' Those views were reinforced by every member of his delegation. One member said that he was considering moving his business out of South Australia and that he was not able to expand in the way his competitors interstate were able to expand, because of unavailable, unreliable and unaffordable power. Colin Goodall, the chairman of the committee said, 'South Australia is the canary in the coalmine.'
            </p>
            <p>
             That is where Australia's energy situation will end up if the Labor Party are allowed to carry out their policies. In South Australia, they recognise the consequence of this unplanned introduction of a massive amount of wind power and variable renewable energy into the grid without any plan and without any proper analysis of how it could be integrated. We know what happened. We have seen it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Labor Party and the opposition leader should explain how their 50 per cent renewable energy target is going to work out—

               How is that going to work out? And how is he going to deliver on double the emissions reductions already committed to by the government—double what we have agreed to in Paris? And they have no plan whatsoever to maintain the stability or the affordability of our energy system. We cannot let that unreliability, that unaffordability, that threat to jobs, that threat to business, that threat to families, go right across Australia. That is Labor's promise if they were to be elected to government.

                My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answer in response to a question from the member for Robertson. Last week in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                , power was cut to households in the electorates of Bennelong, Reid and Robertson. Power was also cut to the Tomago smelter, whose usual power consumption is equivalent to almost one million households. This is despite the fact that New South Wales has the highest dependence on coal power in the nation. When will the Prime Minister stop blaming renewable energy and admit he has a national energy crisis on his hands?

                  The delusion of the member for

                  is remarkable—really! This is a member from

                  who described the blackouts in South Australia, including the one in September last year that cost Arrium—a business struggling to survive; a business where thousands of workers' jobs depend on its survival; on a knife's edge—$30 million. And what did the member for Port Adelaide describe it as? It was 'a hiccup'; just another hiccup! And he complains about one hiccup after another in South Australia. You are seeing businesses being put to the wall in his own state and his own constituents losing their jobs, and he does not think it matters.
