       <p>
        August 19 this year is the 100th anniversary of Afghanistan reclaiming their independence from Britain, and 2019 is also the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Australia and Afghanistan. The signing of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 heralded the beginning of mutual relations between Afghanistan and Britain, and this treaty followed three Anglo-Afghan wars between 1839 and 1919. Each conflict resulted in Britain relinquishing more and more of their power over Afghanistan. I saw an ironic reminder of this when I visited Kabul in 2016. The Afghans had positioned a cannon that they captured from retreating British forces, in 1919, right outside the military training academy in Qargha, which is currently run by the Britishâ€”a little sense of humour they had to walk past every day. The reclamation of Afghan independence should be celebrated as our region is stronger without unwelcome colonial interference.

        This year also marks the 50th year of diplomatic relations between our two nations and we share a friendly and longstanding relationship traced back to the 1860s when Afghan cameleers came to Australia to assist explorers and industry. We're cooperating now on security matters with Australians serving in Afghanistan and we honour those who have sacrificed their lives. Development cooperation is growing, underpinned by people to people connections. I'm proud to represent thousands of people in my electorate with Afghan birth and heritage. We mark these milestones, and I believe we should deepen the friendship and cooperation between our two nations.
