        Great things are happening in the gardens of Tacoma Public School. Three days a week at lunchtime students can be found digging, planting, weeding, feeding, watering and harvesting a variety of fruit and vegetables, which are used to make delicious food for the school canteen. Students can also be found feeding and tending to the worm farm.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school is currently fundraising for a mobile kitchen, which will let students harvest and cook healthy meals together, straight from school garden. What a great way to learn about sustainability and respect for our environment. Giving students the opportunity to grow their own fruit and veggies encourages healthy eating and can have a huge impact on their future wellbeing.

        Participation in the green teams is recognised with the Leafy Leader Awards. Students were given the chance to name these awards, and every year a competition is held to choose a winning design from each class. Congratulations to Sarah for naming the award and to this year's talented artists: Maria Susana, Madison, Savanna, Ava, Alannah, Natureh, Simran and Darcy. Congratulations to principal Jeanette Dillon and year 1/2 teacher

        , who was a year ahead of me in primary school, for your outstanding work with this program. Thank you also to school captains Amy and June posting me at your assembly last week. I look forward to sharing a home-grown and cooked meal with you soon.
