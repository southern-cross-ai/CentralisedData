        I rise tonight to pay tribute to the late Dr Sandra Mercer Moore AM. Raised in rural Queensland, she was educated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Hallows'_School" rel="nofollow">
         All Hallows' School
        </a>
        in Brisbane and then at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        , where she trained as a physiotherapist. In 1964, Sandra married Dr Robert Mercer, and they worked together in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        for a number of years before then moving to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , where they both worked in London, and subsequently returning to Brisbane. Unfortunately, Robert died in 1975, having contracted an infection from a patient he was caring for. Sandra continued her work as a physiotherapist. She became the president of the Australian Physiotherapy Association and subsequently the President of the World Confederation for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Therapy" rel="nofollow">
         Physical Therapy
        </a>
        , an international role which she served in for some eight years. In later times, she became a director of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital in Melbourne. In 1989, Sandra married
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moore" rel="nofollow">
         John Moore
        </a>
        and moved to Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past two decades, Sandra has been a friend, a confidant, a supporter and a willing worker for the Liberal cause. She served on the Menzies electorate council executive and was subsequently elected chairman, a position she occupied for some 16 years. In this role, Sandra was superb, maintaining a close eye on everything happening locally in the party and the broader community. She had an ability, when chairing meetings, of deflecting criticism with a disarming comment and a smile. She also served as chair of the Menzies 200 Club for many years, helping to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for our campaigns both in Menzies and in marginal seats. When I say that she was chairman of these bodies, she was addressed once as 'Madam Chair' in a meeting I recall, and she responded: 'I'm the chairman. I'm sitting on the bloody chair.' Thereafter, her interlocutor and all others referred to her as 'the chairman'.
       </p>

        I recount this anecdote because it was this directness that I admired in Sandra. She had a strong set of values, a clear set of principles, that endeared her to many but of course annoyed others who either didn't share them or were jealous of her abilities. She was closely involved in the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party, serving in senior roles on the administrative committee for a decade, including, I think, some eight years as a vice-president of the party. Her ability to negotiate the labyrinthine passages of a political party with grace and courage was remarkable, and I have no doubt, had she decided that that was her aspiration, she could have become a senator for Victoria, but her focus remained firmly on assisting others. Sandra made great friends and she also made enemies. She didn't suffer fools gladly. Through it all, she handled victory and defeat with the same equanimity. She was awarded a distinguished service award in 2018 for her contributions to the party. She was also made a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her magnificent leadership of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy and her significant contributions to the party.
       </p>
       <p>
        I last saw Sandra on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Eve
        </a>
        , when I dropped around to wish her the best. She'd been in pain and a considerable discomfort for not just months but some years, and she was obviously in discomfort at that time. But I left that discussion on Christmas Eve, having talked about current political issues, believing I'd have many more such discussions in her lounge room or around the dining room table. Alas, it was not to be. So I pay my respects and pay tribute tonight to a wonderful woman; a generous, witty, intelligent and kind person; a world leader in her chosen profession; and a great contributor to our democracy through her tireless work for the Liberal Party. She was truly a woman of character, integrity and courage, and I extend my condolences to her husband, John; to her sister, Deb; and to her stepchildren Joanne and Kristen. May she rest in peace.
