        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does he stand by his view that the member for Moore brings some common sense to this parliament? In relation to the Prime Minister’s recent comment on Iraq, on reflection, does he now share the member for Moore’s common-sense view that ‘spreading it to the Democrats wasn’t probably such a good idea’?

         I think all of my colleagues bring common sense into the parliament. That is my view about the member for Moore. This morning I have been caught rather more by some remarks made by somebody else—namely, the Leader of the Opposition. It is very important that everybody listens to this. The Leader of the Opposition was twice asked this morning on

         by Marius Benson what he thought would be the consequences of an American withdrawal from Iraq. It was hardly an irrelevant question. The debate of the last 72 hours has been all about the future of Iraq and the consequences of an American withdrawal. He was asked by Marius Benson the very direct question:

                   No, what I’m an advocate of is to withdraw the Australian combat component ...

                   We know that. We have known that for several years, but what we do not know is what the Leader of the Opposition believes would be the consequence of a coalition withdrawal by March 2008. Over the last day and a half I have been attacked and lacerated by the opposition for expressing my view, but the Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts to express his. I want to know what the opposition believes. I would like to know—

                      Mr Speaker, on the point of order: this is clearly orchestrated disruption and an abuse of standing orders. It is orchestrated by the Leader of the Opposition and it must be dealt with.

                       The point of order was a question of relevance, if I heard the member for Hunter correctly. The Prime Minister is clearly in order. He is responding in part to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition.

                       <p>
                        The debate here in Australia over the last two days has centrally been about what would happen in Iraq if coalition forces were withdrawn, what would happen to the cause of terrorism in the

                        and what the security consequences for Australia would be.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We have the extraordinary situation where I am attacked because I have had the courage to express my views on the consequences of that. The Leader of the Opposition, in typical fashion, is trying to maintain an attack on us without having the courage to express his views as to what would happen if coalition forces were to withdraw in March next year. That is the central security issue. The reason the Leader of the Opposition is remaining silent is, I suspect, that he knows in his heart that the real answer to that question is the same as the one that I have given, and that is that Iraq would descend into chaos and terrorists around the world would be emboldened. The Leader of the Opposition was twice asked this morning, ‘What do you think will happen if coalition forces are withdrawn from Iraq in March 2008?’ and on both occasions the Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to tell the Australian people what I have told the Australian people to be my belief. That is the central issue in this debate. It has got nothing to do with individuals in another election campaign; it has everything to do with the future of Iraq—
