       <p>
        Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the substantial, significant budget for Australian industry. This budget sets out a policy framework for Australian industry, manufacturing, energy and resources, skills and training, and science, not just for the forward years but for the decades ahead. It sets a clear path to sustainability, new investment and jobs growth, and provides new opportunities in markets for Australian ideas and products. Our approach underpins a new era for Australia which faces up to our challenges, embraces our strengths and accepts our responsibility for forging a new direction. We have the opportunity to reposition Australian industry towards the jobs and sectors of the future, while increasing the opportunity to advance value-adding manufacturing. This future will be built around new ways of sharing knowledge and know-how and greater links—I emphasise: greater links—between science, research and industry itself. In fact, we will be putting science and research at the centre of the Industry portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget represents the hard work of a government that will not shirk its responsibility to restore the nation's finances after Labor's debt and deficit disaster of the last six years; but it is also a budget that signals a clear new direction for Australian industry towards a future of new opportunities, new markets, new jobs and a new era of confidence in our ability and integrity. We have made it clear that no longer will industry policy be based around handouts, bandaid solutions and throwing around taxpayers' money willy-nilly without any strategic focus or long-term benefit to the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian businesses are characterised by a world-class standard of entrepreneurship. We have a stellar record of sparking great ideas and turning those great ideas into real-world applications. We do our Australian businesses a great disservice if we advocate a handout or government led mentality. The government's role is to create the right policy framework and settings to unleash the creativity, ingenuity and practicality of Australians and their businesses. We have a role as a government to be the catalyst, not the gatekeeper.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are investing in national productivity gains and skilled workers of the future through a $1.9 billion trade support loans scheme which will encourage apprentices to take up a trade but, far more importantly, to finish that trade. Fifty per cent completion rates are simply not acceptable, particularly for young people who need a future that is secure with the training they need. We want to turn out people who can take real jobs and have a secure future. We are putting in place a skills and training network that delivers the trained workers that Australian businesses are calling out for, not simply training young people for the sake of training.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I mentioned, the government will be putting science and research at the centre of industry policy, and we are developing a strategic approach to science policy which will adopt a whole-of-government outlook to ensure that all portfolios work together to focus on our resources and delivering future jobs. That is all portfolios of government, not just my own very diverse portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget includes an investment of $1.4 billion in the resource sector, centred around the $100 million exploration development incentive, which is otherwise known as a flow-through shares scheme, something the Labor Party promised but in six years of government never delivered. We want to make it crystal clear that we support the energy and resources sector. It is one of our economy's most significant job drivers, and the private sector investment and national revenue of our country depends on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond the big headlines, of course, we also want to support our communities by getting rid of the carbon tax, the mining tax and red and green tape. We want to stop the constant tax grabs we saw from those opposite during their time in government that attacked the resources sector as if it were an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        , never giving it any credit or security for its future. Our government is about forging new links between industry research and science, and that is exactly what we will do.

        </small>
        <p>
         I thank the minister for his introductory comments. The partnership between resources and science is important, and in Australia we are blessed with some of the great institutions that do support the interaction of science and our resources sector. The most important of those, we believe, is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Geoscience Australia
         </a>
         . I ask the minister to outline to the House the impact of the budget cuts on Geoscience Australia and its interactions with its counterpart organisations in the states and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
         Geoscience Australia provides a significant body of precompetitive data that helps inform explorers and the industry on the prospectivity and, most importantly, helps to drive the exploration sector in the most meaningful possible way. The discovery of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawler_Craton" rel="nofollow">
          Gawler Craton
         </a>
         occurred out of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACE" rel="nofollow">
          PACE
         </a>
         program in South Australia, which grew out of the insights that have grown from Geoscience Australia. Geoscience Australia's role in supporting science in understanding the interaction of water and coal gas extraction is something in which our community has a great deal of confidence. Geoscience is not simply a Canberra based organisation. It is a world-leading organisation that has been consistently supported by successive governments, so I am enthusiastic to understand the minister's views and intent behind the cuts to Geoscience Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also have in our country at the moment a significant and growing issue on the east coast, and that is gas supply—the extraction of gas from coal seams to support the domestic gas supply needs of the east coast. I would like to know from the minister what the Commonwealth is doing to assist that industry to grow. We hear many poorly-thought-through arguments that associate the export gas industry with increasing prices on the east coast. We know our gas prices are being internationalised, but the renovating impact of that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
          LNG
         </a>
         investment, in particular in the minister's home state of Queensland, has had a significantly beneficial impact on gas supply. But there are clouds over how advantageous that resource could be for Australia and the lack of willingness in some jurisdictions to see that gas extracted in a safe way. I stress the word 'safe' because that relates organically to my previous question about Geoscience Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         These things are connected not just by ideas but they are connected organically—the foot bone connects to the shin bone connects to the knee bone. Good science, through Geoscience Australia, gives our community confidence that we know what we are doing. Good science underpins community confidence that gas extracted from coal seams can be done in the best possible way. On this side of the House we strongly stand for good science not as a dalliance but for good science underpinning good industrial and environmental management practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to hear from the minister specifically about the cuts to Geoscience Australia—how those cuts will improve the operation of Geoscience Australia; and the measures that the government will practically take to assist increased gas recovery from the east coast into our pipeline network in the east coast to drive our domestic markets?

          thank the member for Brand for his questions and also of course for his contributions when the Labor Party was last in government towards supporting the resource sector. He was at times a lone voice there but he punched well above his weight. So I thank him for that. He gave the resources sector some glimmer of hope in what was a very bleak time for them when, as I say, the Labor Party treated the resource sector as a punching bag and source of money or an

          In answer to his specific question in relation to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Geoscience Australia
          </a>
          , as the member for Brand knows, I am a great supporter of Geoscience Australia—and he was when he was minister and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">
           Martin Ferguson
          </a>
          before him. We have moved to ensure that, in terms of their long-term appropriations, they have a very secure and solid future. I will confirm, however, that there was a $27-million reduction under section 31 funding from $62 million in the 2013-14 budget to $35 million in 2014-15. There was also a $1.937-million efficiency dividend imposed on Geoscience Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          More to the question, though, we do not expect there to be any long-term impact on Geoscience Australia. There have been some voluntary redundancies that have been taken, but as part of the overall efficiency which we need to achieve from our departments, Geoscience Australia is certainly able to assist in that regard. I have total confidence that Geoscience Australia has the resources it needs to do the job that Australia needs it to do. It is a pre-eminent organisation globally, it is well respected internationally and we certainly need to make sure that it continues to do that work.
         </p>
         <p>
          In regard to coal-seam gas and the way that industry is progressing in eastern Australia, I have played an active role in trying to assist that industry to overcome some of the myths and blatant lies that are spoken about it. Along, as I say, with members from the opposition, we have from time to time needed to explain to our colleagues exactly what is going on in that industry. It is an industry which has enormous potential. As you, Deputy Speaker Scott, know more than anyone else in this parliament, it can bring about enormous beneficial change in the communities it is involved in. In your electorate of Maranoa and in my electorate of Groom, we have seen 4½ thousand farmers sign up to coexistence agreements with coal seam gas operators. I will give an example of the impact of that for individual farmers. I am sure
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Thompson
          </a>
          will not mind me mentioning his name again, or this number, which he stated in public. One of the Deputy Speaker's constituents, Peter Thompson, and his wife, Nikki, have said publicly that they will receive $6 million from coal seam gas companies in return for allowing those companies to operate on their properties. The reality is that that $6 million is without any investment from the Thompsons or any requirement for the Thompsons to be involved in any work or labour or any risk in terms of capital investment. It is changing the whole economic and social landscape of that region.
         </p>
         <p>
          Farmers are cooperating and science is being heavily involved to ensure that the underground aquifers are not affected. The cooperation that has been going on between the state government, the local governments, people like
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Brown" rel="nofollow">
           Ray Brown
          </a>
          from the Western Downs shire and, of course, the Commonwealth government has been exemplary. Unfortunately, that is not the case in other states. At the moment, we are seeing a moratorium in Victoria. Perhaps after the election, again with some encouragement from the Commonwealth government and some assistance from both sides of the House federally, we can encourage some development in that regard. In
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          I am more pessimistic. I am unsure how we can progress that issue. I have made a number of attempts, and I did, for a short time, consider a coal seam gas working group to assist there. But I have abandoned that idea.

           The coalition is committed to driving business competitiveness by supporting business improvement and promoting economic growth through commercialisation of new ideas. I want to ask about the government's commitment to industry policy—more specifically, the delivery of the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program through a single business service initiative. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, unemployment in my region increased to over nine per cent under the previous Labor government, during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. It is absolutely essential that we do things to help the economy in the regions, so, Minister, I ask you to list the programs and the new initiatives that the coalition government is providing for industry to help drive competitiveness and create jobs of the future. Also, focusing on the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, would you tell me the rationale for the creation of this new and innovative program? What are the primary objectives and components of the program? How much funding will it receive? What progress is being made in the establishment of the

            I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I know that, in the short nine months that he has been there, he has had an enormous impact in terms of encouraging new businesses and new industries to that region. He has certainly ensured that businesses in Hinkler—or potentially in Hinkler, or if he can steal them from anywhere else—are aware that he is more than welcoming of new businesses in his electorate. He is making sure that the 'open for business' sign is well and truly illuminated both here and overseas.
           </p>
           <p>
            In answering the member for Hinkler's questions, I will say how important it is that we continue to see businesses established and that we attract not only businesses from Australia but also foreign investment. Innovation in Australia is a very, very high priority for this government, as it was last time I held this portfolio, between 2001 and 2007. We want to invigorate people to commercialise their good ideas. A good idea is worth nothing until it is turned into a commercial opportunity, until it is turned into a job opportunity for people—and, in this case, the people of the seat of Hinkler in particular.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are investing more than $2.25 billion in industry programs over the forward estimates, and this will deliver real outcomes and real jobs. We are certainly not abandoning the industries that those opposite would want you to believe we are. In terms of supporting industries, we have stood behind industries, we are adjusting industries and we are offering industries new opportunities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The range of programs to assist that innovation, create jobs and provide a streamlined and focused approach to industry policy include, as the member mentioned: the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, some $484 million manufacturing worth of funding; the Manufacturing Transition Program, some $50 million worth of funding; the growth fund to assist those involved in the auto industry to transition to new long-term jobs, a total of $155 million of which the Commonwealth government contributed $101 million; the Prime Minister's National Industry Investment and Competitiveness Agenda, which will be announced in the months ahead; and the Industry Skills Fund, which, again, is a very important area in giving business the skills they need and their employees the skills they need to be competitive in an evolving and developing industry framework, some $476 million. Some might say the Trade Support Loan is the jewel in the crown of the training support area, some $1.9 billion of trade support loans. People wanting to do apprenticeships and certain traineeships will be able to access loans of up to $20,000 interest-free and adjusted with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
             CPI
            </a>
            annually.
           </p>

            The response from industry once we explained the Trade Support Loan scheme to them has been excellent. I was actually out my electorate last Friday doing that and the response was overwhelmingly positive. The cost of providing those loans interest-free is around $480 million in the forward estimates. As well as that, we have got: the Geelong Region and Melbourne North Investment Fund, some $54 million and we are well through that; the Tasmanian Investment Fund of $11 million; and the Automotive Transition Transformation scheme for the auto industry, exclusively for the auto industry, some $550 million.

            The member asked about the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. The new program, aimed at supporting the commercialisation of good ideas, establishes and delivers a straightforward, proactive and effective approach to industry policy through a substantive and more efficient implementation platform which is known as the single business service. It will provide market and industry information and advice to business. It will offer business management advice and skills. Experienced private sector business advisers will give access to research and innovators to re-engineer business operations. It will also connect them to supply chains and potential markets as well as commercialisation advice.

             Thank you for your observations about
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Geoscience Australia
             </a>
             . Could I ask you to be more specific. You referenced almost $30 million in cuts to Geoscience Australia. You may need to take this on notice, but just how many jobs have been axed in Geoscience Australia? What were the skills that were lost? What work areas have been affected? What is the ongoing program of graduate recruits into Geoscience Australia? These things are important as I know the minister would understand a healthy and vital Geoscience Australia does require consideration of its structures, of its work programs and of its future skill base.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would also like to ask the minister about the review of the Renewable Energy Target. Minister, we understand that review is taking place chaired by Mr Dick Warburton, a fine Australian and a very significant Australian business leader. I have had the pleasure of meeting with Mr Warburton to discuss that review. But if the minister as the Minister for Energy could advise the House on when we can expect the report of the review on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RET" rel="nofollow">
              RET
             </a>
             that would be great greatly appreciated. If a date and a time cannot be provided then at the very least give an indication of when we can expect that review to be presented because of the importance of the month of August and the casting of the renewable credit numbers for the next year.

              I thank the member for Brand for his question. I will take parts of his question on notice. In terms of the specific skills that have been removed, I will give the member for Brand the detail of that but I will have to take that part of his question on notice, as I will the part on the graduate program. It is my understanding that there is no effect on the graduate program, but I will supply him with further detail in regards to that.

             <p>
              In regards to the actual staff movements, as of 30 May 2014 62 staff have departed
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Geoscience Australia
              </a>
              . By 30 June this year a total of 76 employees will have departed. By the end of December this year a total of 85 employees will have departed. Five employees have elected to seek redeployment and have commenced their retrenchment period. Nine staff have been offered voluntary redundancies and are yet to indicate their preference to exit or seek employment. Existing and projected average staffing levels at Geoscience Australia are 716 in the year 2013-14 and 620 in the year 2014-15. As I said, though, I am entirely confident that there will be no effect on the capacity of Geoscience Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              In response to the member for Brand's question regarding the Renewable Energy Target, I take this opportunity to remind the House both of the coalition's commitment to renewable energy and, more importantly, of the fact that we are the fathers of this scheme. We established the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Renewable_Energy_Target" rel="nofollow">
               Mandatory Renewable Energy Target

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hill" rel="nofollow">
               Robert Hill
              </a>
              , who was the environment minister at the time, implemented this. It has given an enormous boost to the implementation of renewable energy in Australia. We have seen projects built around Australia off the back of the scheme. In terms of Australia's percentage of renewable energy vis-a-vis the rest of the world, we can certainly hold our heads up.
             </p>
             <p>
              In regards to the member for Brand's specific question about the review, he is quite right: Dick Warburton is an excellent choice as chairman as someone who has enormous respect in the business community as he has been involved in business a very long time and has been very successful at it. He and his equally as qualified committee are currently considering the impacts of the Renewable Energy Target on Australia's competitiveness and our ability to continue to maintain a target for renewable energy going forward. It is my understanding that the committee will release their modelling towards the end of this month and that they then will work from that point to prepare the report for government, which we would expect to receive some time after that—perhaps in the next few months.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not expect the government to be long in responding to that review. In terms of my own time lines, I need to hand down an energy white paper this year. I need to be able to be confident that, firstly, the Labor Party has seen the error of its ways—and it is still not too late yet—and will support the rescinding of the carbon tax. I need to see the carbon tax dealt with before I can have any forward concept on where energy policy is going in Australia. Hopefully that will occur in the next sitting of the Senate in early July. I also need to know where the government intends to set its policy in relation to renewable energy. We expect to see a response to the renewable energy review sooner rather than later, perhaps by the third or fourth quarter of this year.

              <p>
               My second question is also on the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. I want to ensure that the minister is aware of some of the absolutely valuable additions from the Hinkler electorate to manufacturing. We are the biggest producer of heavy vegetables in Australia. All of our agriculturalists know that farm gate returns are simply not high enough so we need those value-added products to increase not only productivity but the return to our farmers to make them viable. Inside my electorate, Minister, we have opportunities for macadamias and sweet potatoes. We already have organisations like Austchilli with David and Trent De Paoli. They are a major exporter of chilli, basil and avocado products all over the world. These secondary level manufacturers help our local producers.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other thing the minister may not be aware of is that the Bundaberg port is completely underutilised. The opportunities in Bundaberg and in the Hinkler electorate are quite simple. Land is cheap. We have lots of it. There is a lay-down area in Bundaberg as big as the Brisbane port. We could build container ports, build industry or do anything but we need that seed funding to help those things along. Certainly it is low risk. We are below the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
                Barrier Reef
               </a>
               and are in a low cyclone risk area. There are opportunities there.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bundaberg Foundry, for example, located in Bundaberg just celebrated 125 years of manufacturing. It is still there but it is under pressure from the carbon tax and from red and green tape. They are struggling. Electricity costs are up $1 million. Minister, if you can name a foundry in Australia that is making $1 million a year, I would be very interested.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program is incredibly important. Minister, further to my last question on the government's commitment to industry policy and, more specifically, the delivery of the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program through the single business service initiative, will you advise what the government is doing to ensure that there is smooth transition from the closure of existing programs to the launch of the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program? Is there a date by which the program will be functioning? Is the government on track to meet that date? How will businesses, particularly
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
                SME
               </a>
               s, interact and gain access to the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program—businesses like

               seafood and the Hervey Bay scallop, who could certainly do with an automated shucking machine even though something that would work functionally has not been built yet? How does this new initiative simplify the process for business to seek support? What has the reaction been from major stakeholders to this budget measure?

                I again thank the member for Hinkler and say how impressed I am by the support he gives businesses in his electorate and his knowledge of the issues that they face. I have had the opportunity to visit the city of Bundaberg on numerous occasions. In fact, I remember going there when I was quite young and I remember my attraction to it when I was an older person—fortunately, I managed to break that habit and I do not drink

                 I hear interjections from the other side about handouts. I think we need to be very clear about these programs and how they work. They work to give businesses a hand up and not a handout. I know the Labor Party are infamous for spraying money around with gay abandon and very little purpose. One of the great problems we have had since we took government is dealing with the bandaids they had applied to various industries. I can ask them what commitments and long-term benefits they achieved for the millions of dollars they gave to Alcoa or for the millions of dollars that they gave to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMH" rel="nofollow">
                  GMH
                 </a>
                 to stay in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our programs are specifically targeted at producing results. The government's decision to implement the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program took into consideration the existing status of all current programs that are planned to be phased out of operation. It was almost a grab bag of programs, some of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be shocked to know actually never came into operation. Money was allocated, announcements were made, launches were relaunched but nothing ever happened. I know, you, particularly, Deputy Speaker Scott, would be shocked by that, knowing the value of money! The reality is, though, that we are going to ensure that there are well-targeted programs. To ensure that no business misses out this government has made provision for Commercialisation Australia to operate through until 31 December 2014 and deal with all applications formally lodged before the close of business in 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Additionally, Enterprise Connect will run on a business-as-usual basis until the end of this current financial year and any small- to medium-business owners that were dealing with either Commercialisation Australia or Enterprise Connect will be able to be transferred across to the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program from early in the new financial year to ensure there is a seamless transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The member for Hinkler asked me about the start-up dates in relation to the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. In line with 2014-15 budget commitments, the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program will operate from 1 July 2014. Its interaction with

                 s and access by SMEs is very simple: business will be able to gain access and interact with the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program in person, on the phone or via the internet or email. Throughout this month of June all details of the program will be placed on the

                </p>
                <p>
                 I was asked how this program works in comparison to previous programs. The reality is, as I have just mentioned, there was when we inherited government an overlapping plethora of small grants and entitlements that were not targeted towards any specific outcome. We are sitting about getting the economic settings right, getting rid of red tape and equipping business by giving them the market, information and skills they need. We must remember that Labor's legacy is one of indecision and change. In the last three years, in fact, there were 14 ministers through the former Department of Industry, Innovation,

                  I have a number of questions for the minister about the impact of the budget on the auto manufacturing sector. I do thank the minister for inviting me to attend with him the Altona Toyota manufacturing plant in my electorate. I genuinely thank him for that. I am just regretful that future invitations will not be able to be extended for members for Gellibrand, as the Toyota plant will be ceasing operations in future as a result of the actions of this government.

                  A recent report from
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_University" rel="nofollow">
                   Adelaide University
                  </a>
                  stated that Australia was expected to suffer a fall in national employment of around 200,000 as a result of the planned closure of auto manufacturing between now and 2017 and that the greatest job losses will be in Victoria, with an estimated decline of close to 100,000 jobs. How can the minister justify over $1 billion in cuts to the automotive industry in the budget when the government is well aware that these cuts are putting hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs at risk?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The automotive firms and component manufacturers have repeatedly advised the government of the serious consequences of cutting funding from the Automotive Transformation Scheme at what is an already difficult time for manufacturing and supply chain workers. So why is the government cutting over $900 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme when the minister is well aware that, if passed, these cuts will intensify the financial pressure on the hundreds of firms in the supply chain, firms which have already factored ATS funding into their long-term business and investment decisions?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to the Prime Minister's announcement, the government's so-called $155 million Growth Fund has been set up for firms and employees in South Australia and Victoria affected by the closure of local manufacturing operations.

                 <p>

                  <p>
                   I thank the member for Gellibrand for his question and assure him that, if there are future opportunities—and there should be between now and 2018—for visits to the Altona plant, I will invite him. He did, after all, get the best start to life that anyone could get in Australia, by being born in Toowoomba, and I am sure that, deep down somewhere, there is a lot more good that we can make of that. His choice in politics may have been dubious, but I am sure his heart is made of gold.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regarding decisions made by Australian car manufacturers to cease operation, I draw to point the member for Gellibrand's assertions that our government was in any way responsible for those decisions, most particularly the decision of Toyota. Having known the Toyota management for as long as I have, dating back to 2001, when I was the minister for industry then, I can assure the member for Gellibrand that the government were given very clear indication by Toyota that, in spite of everything we had done and would do, they had made their decision to close. That decision was extremely difficult. The heads of Toyota, both here in Australia and in Japan, came up to Canberra especially to talk to me about that and to also meet with the Prime Minister and explain that decision, but it is a simple fact that, in relation to manufacturing cars in Australia, it is virtually impossible to compete. It needs to be remembered, and perhaps lamented, that the industry arrived at the point under the previous Labor government where it required $5,784 per vehicle, plus tariffs, to continue to operate in Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am an optimist. I have spent a lot of time in farming, where you have to be an optimist. In fact, I was a farmer longer than I have been a politician.
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
                    If I
                   </a>
                   looked at a component of my farming operation where taxpayers had to contribute that proportion, which is almost 15 and, in some cases, 20 per cent of the value of the vehicle, I would say, 'There is no hope.' Unfortunately, though, as I say, we lament it, there was no way in which Toyota, Holden, Ford and Mitsubishi—some of whom made those decisions when the Labor government was in power, some of whom made them since we came to power, but the result is the same—could continue. They all arrived at the same conclusion, and that was that the industry could no longer manufacture vehicles in Australia without long-term, substantial government-taxpayer funded subsidies. Unfortunately, because of the complete and absolute mess that the Labor Party left the finances in, the money that we would be paying the auto industry would have to be borrowed by taxpayers from overseas, and that is just sheer insanity. So, whilst we lament that the car industry has made those decisions, we as pragmatic, rational people understand why it made those decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To assist the industry—and our understanding is that there are substantial numbers but certainly nowhere near the numbers that the member pointed out in that report; let us say the numbers are somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 people to find new work—we have established a $155 million growth fund in conjunction with the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                    South Australian
                   </a>
                   and Victorian governments and the auto industry. There will be $30 million made available for a skills and training program to assist workers to find new jobs outside the industry. There will be a $15 million automotive industrial structural adjustment fund, a $20 million automotive diversification fund for component manufacturers to go into other areas, a $60 million next-generation manufacturing investment program to bring new businesses to those regions and a $30 million regional infrastructure fund to put new regional infrastructure in for communities.

                   <p>
                    Thank you, minister, for your statements here this morning. I would ask a couple of questions. One is in relation to
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
                     ARENA
                    </a>
                    . I understand that a billion dollars worth of taxpayer funds have been committed to nearly 200 ARENA projects across a suite of renewable energy types. I am aware that a billion dollars of government funding has been matched with a further $1.8 billion, I believe, taking the investment in renewables to $2.8 billion as a result of that program. In Queensland we have over $55 million of ARENA funds that have been invested in six different projects.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The government has made it very clear, and rightly so, that we are facing a budget emergency careering towards $667 billion worth of debt, right now resulting in a billion dollars of interest every month, which could blow out to $3 billion. We understand that savings need to be achieved to return that budget back to surplus. What are your plans, as the minister, in relation to ARENA but more so in relation to the 200 projects that were supported under this program? I know that when those opposite were in charge of it there were certainly some high-level failures, probably due to lack of oversight by the former government of those projects. I know a couple of them are sitting at the bottom of the ocean. I am looking at how the government is going to actually deliver real, good outcomes for renewables with this investment.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I also want to ask—and I know the member for Hinkler has asked a couple of questions on it—about the great Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme. It is a brilliant scheme as far as I can see, taking the best of all of the programs that were there and rolling them into one, so that it is almost one point of entry for industry and business. You know, minister—because you have been to my electorate a number of times and spoken with local businesses there—abut the downturn and the impact that has had on the local economy in the Mackay region. That downturn in coalmining has cost thousands upon thousands of jobs but has also seen a significant shift in the way business has to be done locally and what the local manufacturing industry is doing. They were always engaged with the mining sector, but now the taps have turned off somewhat they have to look elsewhere. I am interested to see how that Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme will assist them in that transition to other industries. I think that is going to pay big dividends myself, just having had a look at the cursory information on it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The other side might have been content with just leaving coalmining to wither and die, but I know that they are not our thoughts on the coal sector. We think it has a bright future. I notice that one of the significant policies you are going to be implementing is the minerals exploration tax incentive program. I am wanting to know a little bit about what the government is going to be doing to reboot the mining sector as well.

                     I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Mackay is certainly a wonderful city. Its people are particularly wonderful. There is one in particular my daughter thinks is particularly, particularly wonderful, although he has moved to Brisbane—I have no idea why; perhaps it is to be close to my daughter. But, seriously, my daughter Kate spent some three years in Mackay. She enthused about the city, and more about the fact that it was a city that was prepared to take on the challenges. The region around it, of course, is well known. I am sure the member for Hinkler is aware that it is well known as a very prosperous cane-growing region. They have their good years and their bad, like the coal industry, but there has been a substantial industry built up around it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have had the pleasure of accompanying the member for Dawson to the Racecourse Sugar Mill, where there is an excellent renewable energy project going on. The cogeneration project relies, as I say, on the mandatory renewable energy target. I understand it also had some assistance from the government at the time. Prior to losing government in 2007 I had been up there and talked with their officials. So wherever you go you see great industries but you also see renewable energy industries as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
                      ARENA
                     </a>
                     has, as the member for Dawson alluded to, allocated in excess of $1 billion for renewable energy projects in Australia. That is over 200 projects supported by taxpayers, with a further $1.8 billion being leveraged from the private sector. So there is approaching $3 billion in projects as a result of the renewable energy programs that have been put in place. Our government will absolutely honour those contracts. Where those projects go on and succeed, we will obviously applaud their success. If projects fail then obviously we will take that money back into the pot. But we certainly expect some great results from those programs that have already been funded under ARENA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Those opposite have made many mischievous and incorrect claims. and I will address a couple of them later, if time permits. Contrary to the claims we hear from those opposite, Australia is not walking away from renewable energy. In fact, we as a government are very committed to renewable energy. As I said in answer to a question from the member for Brand, we were the government who began substantive funding of renewable energy and also established the renewable energy target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     By way of information, renewable energy is currently contributing around 10 per cent—perhaps more, in fact, depending on how you do the sums and analyse the economists' predictions—of Australia's energy mix and is assisting not only in ensuring energy security but also addressing some of the short-term peak demand loads, particularly on hot days in Australia, through the very significant rollout of solar panels. Again, that is a program that the coalition began in its last term.

                      Like the member for Gellibrand, I have also been on a tour of a car plant with the minister. I thank him for inviting me at the time, along with quite a few Liberal senators. The member for Hindmarsh was there as well. The rhetoric was somewhat different then, somewhat more optimistic about the car industry's prospects at that time. Sadly, that has proved not to come to fruition.

                       A Labor government would have saved it. But I do not propose to redebate those issues or, for that matter, to give the minister an excuse to give us the lecture about industry assistance only to be followed by government backbenchers asking for grants or tax exemptions for particular industries. It is an interesting approach that the government takes.

                       What I am concerned about, and this is a genuine concern, is the $155-million growth fund. I am concerned about its adequacy. Another of the things I am concerned about is obviously the closure of Holden components industry will devastate the northern suburbs of Adelaide, and Elizabeth in particular. I am interested to know if the minister, his office or his department have had discussions with the local councils of the

                       or the

                        City of Salisbury
                       </a>
                       . In particular, have they had any discussions about local projects like the City of Playford's sports precinct, which is interrelated with the proposal to have a health precinct at
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyell_McEwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>

                       When Holden closes, I am concerned we will have an empty site sitting down there on Philip Highway and it may well be empty for some time. I would be interested to know if the minister is having discussions with

                        General Motors Holden

                       about that site, about its future. I would also be interested to know if the minister has formed a committee with unions, local industry, Holden, the

                       government and the federal department—as was done with Bridgestone—to help manage the process of skills acquisition of employees being made redundant at General Motors Holden or any of the component companies that supply it and to push job service agencies to get jobs for those redundant employees. It was a very important thing when Bridgestone closed. I would be interested to hear the minister's thoughts about that.

                       Most of my concerns are of a local nature. We can debate the events last year. I can tell you the effect of them will be catastrophic in my community. I really genuinely would like to hear the minister's thoughts about how my local community can be assisted out of this $155-million growth fund. I do not think it is adequate and I have great fears that the money will be spent in places other than the northern suburbs of Adelaide, in places other than the communities affected.

                        I thank the member for his question. I plead guilty to being optimistic. As I said: farmer by nature, optimistic by nature. If you go into government, as I know the Labor Party does so regularly, and take a disastrous view of everything, be pessimistic and say it is a catastrophe then what will happen, of course, is what we saw under the previous government—the confidence of the community business community falls, consumer confidence falls, the economy spirals down and then the Labor Party drops back to its old form. There is no problem small enough that the Labor Party cannot throw a huge amount of money at to try and fix with no strategy, no outcomes, no guidelines et cetera. So when the Labor Party sees a problem, the first thing they say is 'throw as much borrowed taxpayers' money as you can possibly get your hands on at it as quickly as possible'. As the member for Dawson said, why do we wonder why we are heading towards $667-billion worth of debt? Why do we wonder why in the six short years that Labor was in government they spent $181 billion more than they earned? In their forward estimates there was a further $123 billion in losses going forward. If they were a company, their shareholders would have shut them down if ASIC had not done it first.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I am asked about the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
                         Future Fund
                        </a>
                        and how it will work and what consultations we have had with industry and the unions. As the member quite rightly identified, when it comes to solving the issues in relation to the car industry I am bipartisan in my approach. As he quite rightly said, I invited all those who are interested in being part of a solution to come along and see what we can do. The
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                         Premier of South Australia
                        </a>
                        was there, and there were senators from both sides. As the member well knows, there were also trade unions there. I see trade unions as playing an important role in the transition of the car industry. I just hope that their leaders are more optimistic and more helpful than those who sit opposite and bleat and scream and call for us to throw more and more money at a problem.

                       <p>
                        There will be significant skills programs to assist those workers, and I know that the automotive companies will be involved. I have had extensive discussions with all three companies. I know that the programs that Ford is running, and the associated programs that are running in Geelong and

                        to attract new businesses to those regions, have been very successful. I give the Labor Party its dues: they established that fund and set up a framework for it to work under. We, as a government, have ensured that the framework has been adhered to and that the corporate governance of those schemes has been successful.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We hope that we will have the support of the trade unions and the support of the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                         South Australian
                        </a>
                        government. And—who knows?—perhaps the opposition, when they realise that they are here to help the people they represent and not just whinge, will get behind these programs. I am more than comfortable to have the unions involved in assisting. I know that some of the unions are involved very well. They have been positive. Yes, they have stood up for their members. As an ex-union leader, I know that that is what they should do. But they do need to accept the reality. Unlike those who sit opposite, at times I think the unions do understand. The best thing they can do for the workers in the car industry is to ensure that they transition to new and better jobs.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        To answer the member's question, as we put together these programs within these companies I would welcome union involvement. I would welcome the involvement of the local federal members and the state members and senators if they think there are things in those programs, particularly about reskilling people, that we can do better. I would be happy to see them involved.

                        <p>
                         I have a question for the minister in relation to vocational education and training, the reforms to that sector and also the establishment of the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
                          VET
                         </a>
                         Reform Taskforce. But let me start by saying that I am very positive about the changes that are being proposed and being talked about in this sector. I could not be more pleased that this government has been especially proactive in the area of VET.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Our national competitiveness, in my view, and our productivity is very dependent on us having a very strong VET sector. We need to make sure that our workforce of the future has skills that make them job ready so that when they enter the workforce they are ready to be productive and to be contributors on the first day that they enter the workforce.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Across Australia
                         </a>
                         our VET students deserve to know that they are receiving quality training and that what is being provided to them is going to meet their needs and will also meet the future needs of their employers. The providers need to know that they will be treated fairly in the provision of the training that they will be delivering to the sector. So we need to take this opportunity to put a magnifying glass over the VET sector and look at what reforms are needed to make sure that this sector is viable in the future. It is certainly no easy task, but I must commend the minister on the action that he has taken to date in that sector. He has been especially proactive and has set up a number of mechanisms where he can get support and input directly from those who know best—those in the industry. He has embarked on a consultation process, first hand, with the sector by establishing a number of workshops throughout the country to engage with the people who actually know best—training providers, industry representatives, employers and students—to find out what is needed to reform this sector in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I attended workshops in Darwin and in Brisbane and also had the opportunity just recently to facilitate workshops with the member for Grey in
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Pirie" rel="nofollow">
                          Port Pirie
                         </a>
                         and Whyalla, with the member for Forrest in Bunbury and also with the member for Robertson in Gosford. The workshops that were run were certainly eye opening. At each of these sessions in different parts of the country we heard of similar problems with the VET sector relating to the duplication in regulations and administration amongst jurisdictions; inconsistency in auditing; the capacity of the system to meet the current skill needs of the industry; and what was particularly concerning was what seems to be an increased focus on qualifications rather than the quality of the training in the sector and, as a result, the quality of the qualifications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         These sessions were not just about understanding what the issues are, they were also about finding ways for the sector to grow and to prosper. The outcomes—the information that came from those sessions—have been forwarded through so they will be part of the changes for future consideration. I would certainly like to thank everyone who was involved in those workshops. I would like to thank all of the members for the work that they put in to make sure that those who attended were quite representative of the various parts of the sector.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So my question to the minister is: can the minister outline for members the action that the government is taking to ensure that the future of our nation is not just about building infrastructure and building the systems to support that but is also about building the skills of our people, particularly those in the VET sector?

                          not only for her question but also for the great job, not only supporting my portfolio in the area of skills and training but, in fact, right across government. She is an incredibly hard-working local member. She has a great practical background from being an engineer by trade and she is one of those people who is set on producing outcomes. The member for MacPherson has certainly continued that attitude since she came into parliament. Again, I thank her for the work that she has done.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          She is quite right: as she and I, my office and my department travel around Australia looking at the issues in relation to skills, training, traineeships and apprenticeships we are at times dismayed by the attitude of some people in relation to making sure that we are producing people who are employer ready. That is, people who are skilled up and ready to go into the workforce not only to secure a long-term future for themselves in their chosen profession—I am sure that that profession may change in time, and we all see that even amongst our families—but also making sure that when young people and mature apprentices, who play an important part in our training system, are turned out onto the street looking for a job that there is a job that they can go straight into.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The member for McPherson is right that there has been too much of an attitude—I am not saying that it is overwhelming, but I am saying it is prevalent—where there has been training for training's sake. There has also been an attitude that the only way you can go forward in this world is to go to university and get a degree. I remember very, very vividly the Labor Party giving

                          an absolute flogging because he had the courage to say in the House, and I remember him saying it when he was the education minister, that a trade is worth every bit as much as a degree. I remember the Labor Party pillorying the then Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, for saying that a trade is worth as much as a university degree. I assure those opposite that I believe that as well, and that the people on this side of the chamber believe that too.

                           Well, if you believe it you should say it a bit more so that the young people in your electorate actually believe that their future can be achieved just as well as any university graduate's by being a tradesperson or trainee, getting a skill and filling an occupation. Do not give them false hope—we hear too often from those opposite that, if it does not go to plan, the government will just subsidise you or pick you up.

                           has identified a key area that we will fix, and that is inconsistency in auditing. In fact, we see a whole opportunity within the skills space to streamline it. The member for McPherson and other members of my committee, which is headed up by the member for Dawson, are working with us and with the people out there in the

                           s, the apprenticeship centres and the skills areas to make sure that we streamline this area so that, when we spend money, we actually get results. As I said earlier, in the area of innovation, when we came into office, we found a whole string of programs that in fact had money allocated to them but had never even been implemented. When I asked the department what these schemes did, they said, 'Minister, they haven't started yet, so we can't actually tell you.' What outcomes did they produce? Zero.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Any discussion on skills would be incomplete without me mentioning the government's introduction of trade support loans. These loans, which I mentioned earlier, provide the opportunity for a four-year apprentice to borrow up to $20,000 and, at completion, have $4,000, or 20 per cent, of that loan written off as an incentive. To receive that loan interest free until he or she repays it is a huge incentive. In fact, it is worth probably over $12,000, or more than double the previous Tools for Your Trade scheme. We see from this scheme tremendous support coming back from the trainee community. As I said, I saw it myself in my own electorate. This is a great opportunity for young people to do their trades and be successful.

                           <p>
                            Minister, firstly, thank you for your introductory statement. I have noted your response to the questions from this side. As you would probably be aware, manufacturing in this country has fallen in terms of employment percentage throughout Australia from about 26 per cent 50 years ago to around eight per cent at the moment. It is very likely those numbers are going to fall even further as a result of losses in the auto industry over the next few years, losses perhaps in the defence industry if decisions are not made sooner rather than later, and losses that will arise, I believe, from the Abbott government's cut to renewable energy programs in this country.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I note that in this budget there is about $7 billion of cuts in higher education, science and research, industry and innovation, of which about $3 billion comes from your own department. Given that we hope for a successful future in manufacturing—and I think there is a general consensus that that will be underpinned by advanced manufacturing—and given the Prime Minister's recent comments whilst overseas that science and innovation is effectively the key to our future, which I agree with, how can you justify not only the cuts to your own department of $3 billion but the $7 billion in cuts across the science and research organisations, which, undoubtedly, go to the heart of innovation in this country?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I heard your responses to questions from the member for Brand earlier on. In particular, you made the comment that you believe that
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                             Geoscience Australia
                            </a>
                            still will have the capacity to function and to carry out its responsibilities. I ask also: with the cuts that that organisation is going to receive, in conjunction with my earlier questions how can you assure us that organisations like Geoscience Australia and other similar organisations that will be subjected to these cuts will be able to carry out the work that they do and support industry in this country as they do?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I particularly also note the programs that the previous government had in the way of direct industry assistance, which amounted to some $800-plus million. Those programs have been cut by almost 50 per cent. I noted your comments about the entrepreneurial funding program, and I understand that, but the bottom line is: how do you justify all of those cuts and still expect that there will be able to give industry the support it needs both in science and innovation and in direct assistance to be able to go into the future and perhaps rather than fall in numbers grow in numbers and grow in capacity?

                             just say from the outset that, if he does not accept that there needs to be cuts to the budget, then is he continuing the old Labor way of continuing to run deficits? In my time in parliament I have never seen a Labor surplus. The reality is that there are members of this parliament who have never seen a surplus in their life from Labor. That is the reality. If the member for Makin says we shouldn't make cuts in this area he needs to now stand up and say where he will make those cuts. If he doesn't, we just assume that Labor will continue on their way with $123 billion worth of deficits in the forward estimates, with the continuation of the debt blowing out to $667 billion, and with the continuation of the pressure that that creates in terms of our economy. He knows and I know that that position is nowhere near sustainable.

                            <p>
                             I want to correct the member for Makin in terms of his statement that we have cut the science and research budget. We have not cut the science and research budget. Can I read for him from our budget papers that the appropriation available to the science and research areas, including science agencies such as

                             and

                             , stands at $5,849 million, and that the increase in the budget—increase in the budget—is in fact $16.8 million. So even at a time where I accept we have to have some austerity measures, even at a time where I accept we have to refocus the programs that the previous government was operating, there is an increase. As I have pointed out numerous occasions during this session, programs were never actually implemented. Some programs never got past the great launch and potentially relaunch and the great talk that went on about programs that never actually delivered a thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             So, yes, we have cut some of those programs, and yes we have put in place a far more focused system of $484 million for the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, a program where we take the best of Enterprise Connect and Commercialisation Australia and we put it into the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. This is a program where we make sure that we are giving business what they need to be competitive, to be innovative, to get into global supply chains, to be involved in the new industries and to give their workers sustainable jobs. On top of that of course we have got the industry skills program which further assists those businesses to ensure that they, the business, and their employees have the skills that they need to make the adjustments in front. That is $1 billion worth of programs for innovation, for skilling, for competitiveness, for getting involved in new products, for collaborating with existing businesses—a set of programs that will ensure businesses the opportunity to be competitive in the long term.

So the boat was going to sit there at port—like a lot of their programs: set up with great fanfare, moored to the dock and not operate. We have actually put some money in to make sure that that boat gets out to sea and does something.

I understand this includes 215 million tonnes of iron ore, 43 million tonnes of coal and more than 1,100 petajoules of gas.

                              Over recent years it is clear that Australians have benefited from the jobs and growth flowing from the high levels of investment in the resource sector, but the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics also reports that Australia's resource sector is moving into a new phase of sustained output and production following the peak of the current resources investment cycle. The resources sector will continue to drive our economy through this new phase, but it is essential that we do not become complacent. These production phase figures highlight the importance of setting the right policy framework to encourage future investment in the resources sector. There is a need for ongoing progress in removing barriers to investment in the resources sector to encourage investment and confidence, to get rid of the reams of red tape and remove tax slugs that compromise productivity and competitiveness. This output phase will last for decades, delivering sustained and substantial economic benefits for Australian workers and local communities as well as boosting national revenue. Minister, what is the government doing to ensure a long and sustainable future for the resources industry?

                               noted, both Deputy Speaker Porter and he took a vital interest in the development of the resources industry in their previous times. The member for O'Connor has a very strong interest in the resources sector not only because he is the member for O'Connor. Some people would argue that O'Connor is at the heart of the history of the Australian resources industry. The centre for that is in Kalgoorlie, which I have had the opportunity to visit. The Mining Hall of Fame in Kalgoorlie is certainly an apt reminder of the huge debt we owe to the miners and resource investors of Australia going right back to the 1800s.

                               I also congratulate the member for O'Connor for his transition to politics. He has a background a little similar to mine. We were both farmers once. I guess he is still more active than I am—in fact, I am sure he is; these are no longer the hands of a farmer. I am sure the member for O'Connor still delights in getting out in the paddock and driving the harvester or perhaps crutching a few sheep if he is having a really good day. I congratulate him on his transition to politics and for his advocacy not only for the industries in his electorate but for all members of the seat of O'Connor.

                               He was quite right when he talked about the importance of the resource sector. The resource sector contributes around 10 per cent of our

                               , employs over one-quarter of a million Australians and indirectly provides income to another 800,000, so over one million people rely on the resource sector for their income and their living. As I said earlier, the resource sector is heaving a huge sigh of relief that the coalition have come back into government and that we have relieved them from the burden of the last six years when they were used as a punching bag by people like the member for Lilley, who constantly attacked successful Australian resource figures. Then, when he had finished degrading their characters quite unfairly, he went on to empty their pockets with things like the ill-fated mining resource rent tax, which had about five iterations. In the end, as we know, it was a great tax introduced by the Treasurer that actually raised no money at all. It chased away billions of dollars worth of investment but did nothing.

                               The member for O'Connor asked me what we are going to do to support the resources sector. Apart from putting the 'open for business' sign up, apart from reducing red tape and green tape and introducing the one-stop shop, we are going to remove the carbon tax, which will give them a huge boost, and we are also going to remove the mining tax. It will be interesting to watch those people opposite vote against those measures when they know that the people of Australia want them removed and they know that the people of Australia depend on the Australian resource industry and industry in general being competitive.

                              <p>
                               The member for O'Connor also asked me what policy initiatives we are going to take, which gives me the opportunity to answer the latter part of the member for Dawson's question. We are going to introduce a $100 million Exploration Development Incentive, previously known as flow-through shares. I think it was the member for Wakefield who said it was a subsidy. That just highlights how little those who sit opposite know about the resource industry. The exploration incentive allows individual entities, mum-and-dad Australians, to invest in the R&amp;D, the research and development, of the resource industry in Australia. What better way is there to do it and say to them: 'If you put your money at risk then, just as we do in the research and development area where we provide a tax incentive for people to do that, we will provide you with a tax incentive to invest in one of Australia's great sectors, the resource sector.' So we are putting in place an Exploration Development Incentive and I look forward to returning to Kalgoorlie with the member for O'Connor where I campaigned with him and we promised that if we got into government we would introduce this scheme. Unlike those who sit opposite, we will do that. We will go back to the drilling sheds, where we stood with people who had put their whole livelihoods at risk to go out and explore for minerals, and we will say, 'We promised and we delivered,' unlike those who sit opposite.

                                Minister, I am happy if you want to take these questions on notice to give as much opportunity as possible for people who want to ask you questions. I would like to get some information on the Industry Skills Fund that is in the budget papers. I acknowledge that its arrival has heralded the demise of $1 billion worth of programs and I note that the minister indicated earlier that some of his thinking was informed by the fact that some of those programs both had not started and had no enrolments. One would think that would be a fairly logical consequence of not having started, but I would appreciate it if the minister could indicate which of the programs that have been cut had not started and which had had nil outcomes. Secondly, in relation to the replacement Industry Skills Fund, there are industries listed as targeted in the budget papers, in particular, health and biomedical products, and I would like to know if that will also encompass skills programs with a broader health workforce. I am particularly interested in the emerging areas of employment opportunity into the future around issues such as aged care, disability care and the health sector care workforce in general. They had a significant take-up of the National Workforce Development Fund, so whether they are still going to be able to participate in the new fund would be useful information. I am also asking for that information in relation to the

                                sector, because the emerging ICT industry sector jobs have been important as well for many regional areas, including my own. How is the minister going to determine what exactly will be targeted under that program in terms of industry sectors?

                                The budget paper indicate that there are 121,500 training places and, it says, 74,300 support services, including mentoring and foundation skills. Is it intended to operate two separate programs for those numbers or is the 74,300 within the 121,500 and it is a joint program? What exactly is envisaged in that part of the industry skills fund? I am happy for you to answer those questions now or to take them on notice, Minister.

                                  One of the biggest surprises for the aged care sector coming out of the budget was the cessation of the aged care payroll tax supplement from 1 January 2015 as found on budget paper No. 2, page 189. It effectively ended the doctrine of competitive neutrality in the sector between the for-profit providers and the not-for-profit providers. It ripped away $652.7 million over four years from the sector. It was a bit of a shock because there was no consultation or sector support for it. The

                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  The greater issue is the impact that the removal of the payroll tax supplement will have on investment in the sector. Aged care in Australia must have a mix of providers to ensure we remain a competitive, innovative industry that offers the highest quality of services available. Removal of this payroll tax supplement will seriously threaten some providers resulting in less competition across the industry.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  She goes on to outline her concerns about the impact on organisational cash flow, future investment, staffing, skills retention and artificial wage constraint.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I have a few significant questions for the minister. What modelling was undertaken into the impact on the aged care sector of this budget measure on viability of providers, their profitability, jobs, workforce and investment? In particular, what has the modelling revealed about the impact on independent providers, small providers and those in rural and regional areas? If no modelling was undertaken, why not?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I understand also there has been some redirection of the workforce supplement into some sweeteners for the viability supplement. Within a few weeks of the budget, leading aged-care services provided some details of the impact on specific providers including in regional Queensland, which saw that particular provider receive an additional $2,900 in the viability supplement but lose $100,000 to $120,000 in the payroll tax supplement. I am sure they can provide you with the details.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I would be interested to know how you intend to deal with the significant impost on the sector. The inaugural report of the Aged Care Financing Authority from 30 June 2013 reports the average net profit before tax across the sector is just 5.6 per cent. How does the government expect the sector to remain viable with this further impost? Has the minister undertaken any specific modelling into the impact on residential pricing? If not, why not? If he has done modelling, what does that show?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  I would like the minister to explain why the payroll tax supplement is being ceased on 31 December 2014. Why is it that the minister has actually ended the principle of competitive neutrality which has been accepted by both sides of parliament since 1988? I refer also to the comments of Louise Dudley, the managing director of Bupa care services, he said recently:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  I have to go to each of the state governments now and discuss with each one, one at a time, which really is increasing red tape, and that's the opposite of what the government was trying to achieve nationally.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  How does the end of competitive neutrality sit with the policy of your government in the reduction of red tape as well?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  You would appreciate, of course, that, according to ACFA, we will need to build an additional 80,000 aged-care places over the next decade. This involves an extra $25 billion, according to ACFA. You would be aware, Minister, that the surprise budget announcement actually forced one provider, Japara Healthcare, to halt trading. I wonder how you expect the sector to cope with the increased investment they need to build residential aged-care placements and capital infrastructure in the decades ahead.

                                   Payroll tax is essentially a state tax. States impose a variety of taxes, including payroll tax. So, effectively, this supplement was the Commonwealth transferring funds to the various states around Australia via the aged-care sector. It is this government's belief that states are responsible for their own tax measures, including payroll tax, and that this is a matter, therefore, for the states. On that basis, the Commonwealth decided that in future we are not going to supplement—we are not going to, in effect, provide a subsidy to—the states in relation to their taxes. That is a matter entirely for the states.

                                    Minister, would you clarify something for many people in my electorate who have been receiving and expressing great concern about some Labor Party material that was circulated, focused on the pension in particular. I understand there have been some flyers put out by Labor Senator Cameron saying, quite inaccurately, that pensioners will lose the seniors supplement. That has now been clarified as not true in that they do not even receive this supplement.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    Obviously, it is an appalling campaign and the misinformation has caused great concern. It really does reflect an opposition party with no ideas for the future, no clue, no platform of their own and no alternative budget. We know that pensions will continue to increase twice every year and into the future, even with the re-indexation changes in 2017 locking them into the cost of living, but the scare campaign evidently has had its effect. It has caused great concern about the impact on the pension supplement. Could you confirm the status of that supplement in the budget and whether it will be increasing at all in the future?

                                       s, no. Senator Cameron, who happens to also be the shadow minister for human services, I believe, put out this flyer, in which he said, amongst other things: 'Age pensioners lose $876.20 per annum seniors supplement.' One would hope that the shadow minister for human services would actually know the facts of who receives what. Presumably, he has now sought to clarify that.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       To come to your question, the age pension will continue to go up and so will the pensioner supplement. Indeed, in March of this year, the age pension increased by $15.70 for singles and by $11.90 for each member of a pensioner couple. That was three months ago. In three months time, in September, the age pension will increase again, as it will in March and September of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018—and I could keep going, but I will not take up the time of the chamber—continuing for years into the future. In addition to that, the pensioners will keep the energy supplement, which is up to $361 per annum for singles and up to $546 per annum for couples. In addition to that, if the Labor Party would finally see some reason and allow the repeal of the carbon tax, pensioner households would be also better off as a result of that measure passing the Senate. In addition to that, the pension supplement will continue into the future. Currently that is worth up to $1,635.40 for singles and up to $2,464.80 for couples. The pension supplement will also increase in future.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       So in relation to pensioners—contrary to what the Labor Party around the country is seeking to mislead people about—pensions will continue to increase in March and September of each year, not just this year but each year into the future. The pension supplement will continue to be paid and that, too, will increase. As I said, the pensioners will keep their energy supplement of $361 per annum for singles and $546 per annum for couples, and if the carbon tax is repealed there will be an average benefit per household in Australia of some $550. That will vary according to the configuration of the household, but none-the-less that would be an advantage for pensioners as well.

                                       Now, I can just wrap up in summary by saying that for pensioners, the pension will continue to increase. It will go up twice a year in March and September of each year. The pensioner supplement will continue and pensioners will continue to get paid the energy supplement. And if the Labor Party would get out of the way they would have a major saving through the repeal of the carbon tax.

                                           The minister has already indicated that he does not understand the budget, and he has just tried to say, as he said in question time this week, that pensioners are better off under this government. I have to say to the minister that that will come to haunt him. The Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield, actually said in Senate estimates just a little while ago, 'The decision to cut the indexation of the pension was put in place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase.'

                                           I will just remind the minister of a quote I have from him from the

                                            Hansard
                                           </i>
                                           of 20 September 2011 about the importance of using male total average weekly earnings to index pensions instead of using the
                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                                            CPI
                                           </a>
                                           . At that time the minister—though he was not the minister then—said, 'This enabled pensioners to keep ahead of cost-of-living increases.' Exactly right. The minister got it back in 2011. Now, of course, what we see in the budget papers on page 203 is that the government is going to take $449 million off pensioners. That is what the budget papers say, and this was confirmed just yesterday by Senator Cormann when he said that the budget cuts will result in a cut to the pension.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           The question to the minister is: who is right—the budget papers, which say a cut to the pension of $449 million; Senator Cormann, who says that the cuts will result in a reduction in the rate of increase to the pension; or Senator Fifield, saying that the cuts to the indexation of the pension have been put in place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase? I would suggest to the minister that all of those comments by his colleagues are correct. What is the minister going to say to correct the misleading comments that he made on ABC radio and that he made in the parliament this week?

So she should be more accurate in what she says. I ask this question rhetorically: if it is good enough for the Labor Party when in government to index family tax benefit part A by the

The point of order is that these budget papers—which is what this is all about—says that there is a cut of $449 million. That is a cut to the pension, and it is time the minister faced up to it.

                                                   stuff coming from the honourable member opposite. In Labor language, a $15.70 increase for single pensioners is somehow a cut and an $11.90 increase for each on a couple pension is somehow a cut. Go out on the street and ask ordinary Australians, 'If we give you an extra $11.90, is that an increase or a decrease?' The reality is it is going to be an increase.

                                                      , the consumer price index. The increase that occurred in March occurred according to the consumer price index. We are saying that in the future we propose to index this, as the Labor Party did when in government, for family tax benefit part A according to the consumer price index. The Labor Party are running around this country trying to scare pensioners by saying that there is going to be no increase in the age pension. There was an increase in the age pension three months ago and there will be another one in another three months time. This great lie from the Labor Party will be found out when pensioners get their next increase in September.

We see it on display again.

                                                         could just thank the minister. During almost all of the 43rd Parliament I was a full-time candidate down in Bass and his door was always open to talk about issues of substance. One of the issues we talked about and that I campaigned strongly on before the last election that always attracted a great deal of interest in northern Tasmania was indexation of the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card. I can recall talking to large groups of people, including with people from the Association of Independent Retirees. There was a great deal of interest in this issue.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         The minister's office staff were always very welcoming and were ready to provide us with details in relation to these matters. I was able to report to the Association of Independent Retirees that the coalition had made a very strong commitment to index the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors card. If I recall correctly, we made the same strong commitment at both the 2010 and 2013 elections. How refreshing to see that that promise has translated to a budgeted measure in this year's budget. This measure improves the lives of many Australian senior citizens and it does so in a way that is intended to be fair, clear and consistent. I know the government is being as generous as it can be at this time, given the wider national social context of strong fiscal restoration and recovery.

                                                           It is necessary that we engage in a process of strong fiscal recovery, especially after a government that delivered $191 billion in deficits in their six years of government and $123 billion of deficits projected across the forward estimates. We borrow $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on our debt. That is why we have to engage in that strong process of fiscal restoration and recovery.

                                                           Our indexation promise is reflective of a government that has both a heart and a strong social conscience. It is matched by a strong desire to help, assist and support all seniors, both pensioners and self-funded retirees alike. Our decision to index the Commonwealth seniors health card is important in my electorate of Bass but will no doubt resonate across the nation. Does the minister have any estimate of how many people will specifically benefit from this measure and how many new cardholders the government expects over the years as a result of this measure?

                                                            I thank the member for Bass for his comments and his questions. Indeed, it was my pleasure to spend some time with the member for Bass during the time leading up to his successful election. I wish him great success and longevity in continuing to represent the constituents of Bass. I look forward to working with him for many years into the future to ensure that the good citizens of Bass are well and truly represented in this place.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            Yes, I can say to the member for Bass this measure has been budgeted for. The estimates are that by 2018 there will be nearly 27,000 additional cardholders because of these measures. It is interesting the Labor Party is very silent on this measure. There is reason for that—in their whole six years in government they did not index it once. No wonder there is silence coming from the other side.

Minister, one of the first things I would like you to do is explain how you will address the growing pressures in the aged care workforce. We assume you know about the 2010 intergenerational report which showed we need a 300 per cent increase in workers to care for our ageing population by 2050. There are low wages, a lack of career pathways and a lack of professional development being experienced by the sector.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 I am eager to know how your government intends to ensure the workforce is there. We see a 25 per cent turnover in this sector; about 96 per cent of the people working in the sector are 45 years of age and older; and about 75 per cent are from migrant backgrounds with 35 per cent having lived in Australia for only five years or less. Minister, would you please explain how giving the workface supplement to aged-care providers with no conditionalities on salaries, professional development, career paths or training will have anything to do with addressing these alarming workforce concerns?

                                                                 Giving aged-care providers back the aged care workforce supplement over five years will do nothing for the development of the aged care workforce.

You said you would undertake a stock take of workforce development projects. I ask the minister to provide details of that stock take and outline which projects have been cut in the budget, which you intend to propose to cut and which will remain. How will you address these specific concerns and additional pressures the sector is experiencing in regional and rural areas?
                                                                </p>

What recommendations did the aged care sector committee make to you? Further, Minister, you answered none of my questions on modelling concerning the aged care payroll tax supplement and addressed none of the issues I raised previously except to say that payroll tax was a matter for the states. In fact, your government has breached the long-held bipartisan approach to the issue of competitive neutrality in the aged-care sector in an unsurprising move, I would say, because your government has had no regard for the aged-care sector since it has been elected.

As I recall—and I was about and he was not—that it was the Howard government that actually moved the very substantial changes to aged care in Australia. It took it out of a cottage industry and into the modern, sophisticated sector that it is today. I encourage the honourable member opposite to have perhaps a closer check with the history of what has happened in this regard.
                                                                 </p>

Firstly, a 2.4 per cent increase in care subsidies and grant payments for eligible aged-care programs from 1 July 2014. All programs previously eligible for the workforce supplement will receive this funding. These increases are on top of normal indexation and will replace payments that would have been available under the previous workforce supplement.
                                                                 </p>

All services currently receiving the viability supplement will receive this increase.
                                                                   </p>

The government will also roll the conditional adjusted payment paid in residential care into basic care subsidies, including Aged Care Funding Instrument care subsidies. Providers will continue to receive the 8.75 per cent as part of the basic subsidy but will no longer need to complete the annual declaration or annual staff training statements.
                                                                   </p>

And from 2015-16, financial reporting and programs receiving the 2.4 per cent funding increase will be reviewed and, where relevant, strengthened based on advice from the Aged Care Financing Authority. For 2014-15, providers will be still be required to provide financial statements as per current arrangements.
                                                                   </p>

                                                                    As to the workforce requirements, this government is well and truly aware of the workforce requirements. The basic foundation of this budget is one which actually recognises the ageing of the population in Australia. It recognises the ageing of the population in Australia, and that is going to have a very significant impact on this country. Not only are there going to be larger numbers of older Australians, largely more dependent than those who are in the workforce, there is also going to be a shrinkage of the growth of the workforce in the future. If you look at the major measures in this portfolio, for example, the measures to take the pension age up to 67 by 2023—which I admit the Labor Party was moving to—and to continue that trajectory to 70 by 2035 is a recognition of the ageing of the population.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    When the age pension was set in place in this country over a century ago —and there were questions about this earlier—average life expectancy was less than 60. As I recall, it was about 55 for men and about 59 for women. So this is recognition, if you like, of the major demographic shift—the seismic shift in the demography of this country—which will occur over the next 10 or 15 years. That is why we are doing things as we are in relation to the age-pension age in this country.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    It is, equally, why we are saying to people under 30 that 'we expect you to earn or learn'. If you do not meet the exemptions, which means you are not a full-time parent, or you are incapable of working for 30 hours or more a week, or you are in training or in a range of other exemptions—in other words, if you are capable of working full-time—then we expect that you are in a job. But if you are not in a job and you are under 30, and you are not within the exemptions, then because of this demographic shift our expectation is that you should be in training to get the job that you can have in the future because we will need every worker we can find in the future. So far as the aged-care workforce is concerned, that is something which is continuing to be monitored by the expert advisory committee, which advises Minister Fifield in that regard.

My question is about the Newstart measures for the under 30s, how they are to apply and what is going on with this measure. I am particularly concerned about the revelations in Senate estimates where the social services department confirmed that, with penalties, some people will actually be up to 11 months with no payment whatsoever. Can the minister confirm that that is the case and explain to me how those penalties have come about and how we end up with 11 months with no payment?

                                                                     <p>
                                                                      I am also very particularly concerned about how this would apply to, say, a young woman under 30 who does not meet one of the exemptions but who finds herself in the early stages of pregnancy. Will she be exempt or will she face somewhere between six and 11 months of no payment whilst she is pregnant? What sort of analysis has the department or the government done of services that these people will need to rely on? I understand that there is some emergency relief money that has been quarantined but that this is not new money or additional money; it is actually existing money within the budget that has been put aside. What sorts of services and support are in place for these people to survive from six to 11 months with no money, particularly pregnant young women who may be caught up in this measure? We are very concerned on this side of the chamber about how this will apply and I would appreciate the minister giving a detailed and frank answer.

They are the ones who have the most difficulty in obtaining a job. So, as I said, this applies primarily to people who are capable of working full time—they are capable of working more than 30 hours a week.

The indexation of income thresholds for the card is obviously something that seniors advocates have been calling for for a long time. I am very pleased that the measures have been finally put into the budget, something that those opposite had six years to do and never did. These measures will benefit seniors every year into the future.
                                                                          </p>

Many self-funded retirees travel overseas to see friends and family and, despite the fact that they do not receive income support payments, they are still limited to six weeks before their card gets cancelled. That means that they have to reapply. It is a fairly long, bureaucratic process, I am told, and results in some administrative overhang that, frankly, many think is not necessary. I would be interested to know: has the government considered the matter of extending the portability period of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card in this budget?

Indeed, we have had representations about this matter and have taken those representations into consideration. As a result of that, we have announced some changes in the budget. Indeed, as I recall, one of the bills that was introduced into the parliament this morning covers this matter. Portability will be increased from six weeks, as it currently is, to 19 weeks in the budget legislation. That is more than a threefold increase in the portability time, going from six to 19 weeks, and that will commence from 1 January 2015. So, from the beginning of next year, there will be this increased portability period which will benefit those people in that situation. It promotes greater certainty in their circumstances, and it reduces red tape for the government, so it is a win-win situation both for those who are the recipients of this increased portability and for the government in terms of reducing red tape and the bureaucracy in relation to this matter. It acknowledges the contribution that self-funded retirees have made to this nation, the fact that they have saved and worked throughout their entire lives. Self-funded retirees are a minority of the people in retirement in Australia. That is the reality of the situation. This is a modest measure, indeed, but nonetheless a measure which seeks to recognise their great contribution over a long period of time.

Part of the reason for the drop-off in consumer confidence was that the minister was running around the country, really from Christmas onwards, talking about some sort of welfare crisis in the country, and a lot of people in my electorate certainly take deep offence at that.

It was just designed to scare people, to concoct this budget emergency that does not exist, this big con, so that you can swing the axe harder at people in my electorate by constructing this fake emergency, this welfare crisis. I remind him that HILDA said that, in 2001, 23 per cent of working age people in Australia received a welfare payment each week. In 2011, that had dropped to 18½ per cent. That is one fact.

On what planet is this minister more credible than the people who put together the HILDA Survey? That is my first question. The second one relates to this whole thing—and, again, people will be fronting up to offices that he, as the minister, administers and asking this question. They heard the Prime Minister say that there would be no changes to pensions. Of course, there were. And now they hear the minister say and they hear the Prime Minister say that the pension has not been cut. My second question to the minister, then, is: if the pension has not been cut, why do you claim on page 203 of your own budget papers—

The members opposite asked me about my constituents. Unlike some of the members opposite, I came to this place directly from the real world. I used to act invariably for people at the lowest end of the socioeconomic spectrum. I spent the majority of my professional life working for people on legal aid. I want to give an example of one such constituent, whom I have maintained an excellent relationship with, whom I had the pleasure of acting for in

                                                                                      I was acting for Vince in the Mount Gambier Magistrates Court. Courts, like this place, are open to the public and to other people about to appear before magistrates. On this occasion, I was presenting a guilty plea on behalf of Vince. Amongst other things, I made clear to the magistrate Vince's mild intellectual disability and that he was on the disability support pension. Vince was built like the proverbial. In the gallery at court, awaiting proceedings, was a significant employer in Barker. After I finished on that day, I got a phone call from this employer, who said, 'Tony, that lad of yours that you acted for today—does he want a job?' I said, 'Of course he does, but you've heard both his legal predicament and the issues with his intellectual disability.' This employer said to me, 'Tony, I'm happy to offer him a job.' I am pleased to report that that individual, many years later, remains in that employment. From time to time, we catch up and he says to me, 'You know, I never thought I'd work. I thought I'd be on the disability support pension my whole life.'
                                                                                     </p>

So, Minister, I ask this question: could you outline the government's policy to improve the social and economic participation of people with disability in our community?

Indeed, I recall that during last year's Pollie Pedal I had a forum with the Prime Minister and with a number of disabled people and young carers in Barker. One of the announcements in the budget—of bursaries for young carers—directly arose out of that meeting that we had in

                                                                                      </p>

I was in the electorate of Logan in southern Brisbane last week, where I saw a very impressive operation employing disabled people, where a person who had worked in the abattoirs there had set up a commercial lawn-mowing business. All the people employed in that commercial lawn-mowing business are disabled. In that operation he employs something like a dozen or 15 people driving commercial lawnmowers. He has vast contracts throughout the area for councils, parks and gardens, and things like that. All of those young people, under the age of 35, had moved from being on the Disability Support Pension, onto full-time employment. That just shows that, if we have the desire, there is a way in which we can assist many disabled people.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                       When I meet with disabled people around this country—as we all have, over a long period of time—they invariably say that they would like to work. People want to participate. They want to be part of the life of this country. They want to be part of the economic life of this country. So we need to find ways to encourage them to do that.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                        DSP

We are not referring to people who quite clearly cannot work but people who are capable, maybe, of doing some part-time work. In the past there has been a requirement that they have a participation plan but there was no requirement for them to follow it up. There was no requirement to go and do some work experience if that was what was in the participation plan. There was no requirement to undertake some form of training if that was what was in the participation plan. So in this measure we are proposing that people on DSP, under 35, who are capable of doing some part-time work, should have a participation plan and that we should follow-up that participation plan with them. In that way we would encourage them to get into work if that is what they are capable of.
                                                                                      </p>

I remember the changes we made back in 2005 in relation to DSP. One of the things that people were concerned about was that if employment did not work out for them the safety net would still be there. That is something which I think is very important in this regard.

As I am sure the minister is well aware, some of these programs have moved between portfolios—possibly between Human Services, Social Services and Immigration.
                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                        I have had the pleasure of travelling around many parts of the country visiting a range of migrant resource centres and settlement service providers, and I am sure we all agree that these organisations do outstanding work in our community, particularly in helping new arrivals establish themselves in our community. These organisations give the new arrivals not only a sense of inclusiveness but a very real connection to their new country. The strong message I am receiving from many of these organisations is that there is currently a lack of clarity or certainty in relation to some specific grants in the settlement and multicultural services space in particular. I have conveyed these concerns to the minister's parliamentary secretary. The response I received was pre the budget, which is why I am seeking an update now. I wrote to the parliamentary secretary on 1 April stating that several multicultural organisations and migrant resource centres had contacted me expressing concern about the future of the Settlement Grants Program. I asked if the parliamentary secretary could confirm that the Settlement Grants Program was safe and would not be removed or have substantial amounts of funding cut from it in the upcoming budget. I said this information would be greatly appreciated so these organisations could be assured this program would continue to operate. The parliamentary secretary replied on 7 May. The primary paragraph in that response is said: 'As you would be aware, the Australian government is committed to reviewing all spending across government. As soon as the

                                                                                       </p>

But I am sure, as the minister will appreciate, this uncertainty is not beneficial to many of these organisations around the country who are trying to plan for the future, including for their existing staff and their future staffing levels. So I am seeking some clarity on these matters that can be communicated to these people. As an example, I note the Settlement Council of Australia commentary on the budget. The council said in a newsletter that its members were eagerly awaiting the announcement of the federal budget this year to gain clarity on the funding of settlement services within the portfolio of the Department of Social Services.
                                                                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">

The council says there are significant cuts to the Strengthening Communities program which was concerning and refers to DSS program information on the settlement services within the new grant arrangements with the grant structure including longer grant terms, simplified reporting and acquittal processes.
                                                                                       </p>

The feedback I keep getting is about people not knowing, beyond that date, about what is going to happen from that time forward. The Settlement Council's newsletter says the council looks forward to working with the government and DSS to understand and implement the new grant arrangements within the settlement sector. It also says greater security of funding will enable the settlement sector to continue to build on the proud record of the world's leading service delivery to newly arrived migrants and refugees. I would reiterate those remarks.
                                                                                       </p>

Can the minister detail all the specific grant programs and funding items impacted by the $33 million cut to the Strengthening Communities line item as stated on page 98 of the Social Services portfolio budget statement? As I said, many stakeholders are saying it is not clear to them what individual line items are included in that funding envelope so that they can plan for the future, particularly beyond this financial year.

In relation to settlement services, they will continue. Indeed, the funding for future years will be greater than it has been for this year, which you will see if you look again at page 98 of the portfolio budget statement which you referred to.

This is the new structure, if I can be permitted for a moment to show this to the honourable member, and we can provide a copy of it if the honourable member does not have it. It shows quite clearly that settlement services is part of this new structure.

I am a passionate supporter of the NDIS and this government is a passionate supporter of the NDIS. We have supported the NDIS at every step of the way and we remain committed to rolling out the NDIS in full.

So there is great excitement in Colac about the investment that the federal government is making in the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

The NDIA will generate about 450 direct jobs in total for Geelong by 2019-20. Already there have been some 125 jobs created and that number is expected to rise to 300. So not only is this a wonderful scheme for people with a disability, their families and their carers it is also wonderful for jobs in our region—it is so positive for jobs in our region.

A number of weeks ago I visited Kids Plus Foundation in Geelong. This is a wonderful agency, giving help to young children and to babies, principally those with cystic fibrosis and other similar conditions. Up until recently they have had no government funding and now with parents coming along with their NDIS packages under the trial they are getting incredible help. So it is wonderful to see what a significant difference this is making in the Corangamite community and across the Greater Geelong region.

Once fully rolled out, the NDIS will assist around 460,000 Australians with a permanent and significant disability, at a cost of $22 billion. So this is a wonderful initiative. I am so proud that we are funding this program and that we are getting on with the job of looking after people with a disability.

Can the minister also confirm that the government has reversed the previous government's decision to apply the efficiency divided to NDIS support packages and the second development fund?

I travel everywhere by bike, and the last time I was in Colac I was on my bike as well. Indeed, I met with a group of carers and a group of people interested in disability there. We met at one of the motels in Colac on a Saturday or Sunday morning. There was a large group of people there who were very concerned about these issues regarding disability. On that occasion the Prime Minister and I spent some time with them listening to their stories and what they were concerned about. This was at a time before the NDIS had actually been thought of and brought into operation. It is for those sorts of people, their families, their carers and their friends that the NDIS is a scheme whose time has come.
                                                                                                </p>

This is something that has been bipartisan in Australia. It is one of those things which happens only every so often in this country where a major social change has come about. We are in the throes of the implementation of it. It is going to take a number of years. The honourable member talked about the trials which are occurring in the Barwon region in Victoria and elsewhere around the country. The whole purpose of those trials is to provide us with the information that can help us to roll out this scheme in a way that will work for the people that is aimed to work for.

The reality in Australia is that, if you are injured as a result of a vehicular accident, state accident compensation schemes around the country apply to those people. But, if you have a disability through some other cause—through no fault of your own—the reality was that you were not in the same situation as an individual or as family and friends of people injured in that sort of accident. This is aimed at providing equality of treatment, if I can put it that way, and equality of outcomes in terms of the care that can be provided for people who have a disability.

There is a parliamentary committee that oversees this process, which the Labor Party, the coalition and others are involved in, because we believe—and we argued this for a long time in the parliament—that this is too important to just be the subject of partisan politics. That is why when we were in opposition we threw our support behind this proposal and that is why now in government we are fully committed to the rollout of it.
                                                                                                </p>

The reality is that there was an efficiency divided applied to the NDIS and this was something which we thought was inappropriate in relation to a commitment to rolling out this scheme. In this budget, the efficiency dividend of $44.9 million—which was effectively a cut to the NDIS—has been reversed. I think that is a clear indication that this government is fully committed to the rollout of the NDIS.
                                                                                                </p>

We are committed to the NDIS. We will see it rolled out. We do not underestimate the difficulties involved in the rollout of this scheme. That is why the trial sites are so important to provide the learnings for us over the next few years as to how this can best work. Already there are some results in from the first couple of quarters from various trial sites around the country. Some of those results have been mixed. What we have to learn from that is whether or not, for example, the results which are not as good as we might have thought are simply a product of the start-up of a new system and whether or not these things will be ironed out over time or whether they are longer term issues that need to be addressed in terms of how the system is put into operation. But I assure the member for Corangamite, who is a great supporter of the NDIS, and all members of this House and the parliament and the people of Australia that the coalition is 100 per cent committed to the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

We propose that we will commence with higher education for the first 45-odd minutes before moving to schools and child care.
                                                                                                  </p>

Of course, the Australian public know all too well that they were promised no cuts to education, but in higher education alone we know that this package is such a shambles that it is cutting some $5.8 billion from higher education. We also know that, whilst the education minister repeatedly refers to expanding opportunities for 80,000 extra students, there is no new funding for 80,000 new students—not at all. What the government is planning to do is extend government subsidies to more students by spreading less money more thinly across a greater number of students. This is a preposterous policy position which the minister has put forward. We certainly welcome the opportunity to reiterate some of the concerns which have been raised in the sector but also to ask some questions on how this will be implemented.
                                                                                                  </p>

We know that they have come out in waves against these higher education changes, arguing particularly that these changes will hurt their students.

What I will instead do is ask some questions of the minister, which I hope that he will be able to address in his next contribution.

Has the government done any modelling on the impact of deregulated higher fees on students and on the broader economy here in Australia? Does the government envisage universities will use the international student fee rate as their maximum rate and has this been included in modelling? If some universities charge much higher fees than other so-called less prestigious universities, does the government concede that this will lead to a two-tiered system and price students out of certain universities? Doesn't this challenge Australia's current system of fair and equitable access to education? It is unthinkable that the government can, on the one hand, argue that some universities' fees may go up and, as they like to keep saying, that some universities' fees may go down and, on the other hand, not concede that this leads to our national system becoming a two-tiered system at least. I would like to know whether this is the minister's view? And, if not, what modelling has been conducted on the Australian education sector, in Australia, that he can fall back on to guarantee that that will not be the case?

But I will pick up some of the things that she said in her speech. I am sure then that members of the coalition might want to make a contribution and I will respond to those as well.
                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                    The shadow minister asked a series of loaded questions. Let me explain a little bit about the education package in the budget. First of all, there are no cuts to education in this budget—none whatsoever. Over the next four years, higher education increases every year to the point where we will have $900 million more in spending over the next four years in higher education. And there are some elements of the new spending proposals that the shadow minister did not touch on. Obviously, we were met with several funding cliffs when we came to power. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy was one of those funding cliffs where Labor had extended the scheme for 12 months and it was an ending program. We were faced with letting that program end or finding the money in the budget to continue it because of the very good work that NCRIS does. I am sure that the member for Adelaide would agree that NCRIS is a very worthwhile scheme to support research infrastructure. I and, I am sure, the member for Adelaide, have visited some of the outstanding examples of where NCRIS is making a difference to research in Australia.
                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                    Well, we found that money and we continued to fund NCRIS into the future. We did the same thing with the Future Fellowships program, a program that typically is for mid-career researchers, to ensure that once they have passed through the early stages of being a researcher we do not lose them overseas, poached by excellent universities around the globe—that we can continue to use the skills that they are developing here in Australia. Anyone who attended the Prime Minister's Science Awards at the end of last year would note that a number of the winners were mid-career researchers who had benefited under the Future Fellowships scheme.

It might be the member for Curtin's electorate, but I am sure she supports mid-career researchers being supported. And I am pleased to say that in the budget process I was able to secure the funds to keep the Future Fellowships program going into the future.

The total higher education research international and agency spending over the next four years is $48.3 billion, and it is increasing by $900 million. That is an enormous investment by the federal government in higher education and research because we very much value higher education and research.
                                                                                                         </p>

There are eight key elements and I will touch on a couple. I would have hoped that the member for Adelaide would support the expansion of the demand-driven system to the sub-bachelor courses—the diplomas and the associate degrees—because that is a new spending measure that is costing the government money. It is costing us $371.5 million over three years. That will give, typically, low-

So that is just one element of the budget measures. As my time has expired, I might turn to the others the next time I get an opportunity.

                                                                                                           I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the minister. It is about the funding cuts to the subsidies for different programs. I must say that I was quite stunned to see the extent of the cuts of the subsidy for both engineering and science. Both of these undergraduate courses have now sustained cuts of 28 per cent. That seems to be very peculiar position to adopt a time when I think we would all acknowledge that we need to really ramp up the skills that we have in the nation in engineering and in science. If we are to be a successful nation into the future we are really going to need to skill up in those particular areas. Could you tell us just what your thinking was and what you think the impact might be on these very, very significant cuts to those particular disciplines—bearing in mind that I think you would understand, Minister, that science graduates do not necessarily generate massive income. It is not as if we are going to be seeing enormous earning potential. Indeed, with the 457 visas, even Australian engineering graduates are having trouble earning a decent living these days. I am really concerned about that. I would like you to address what you think and what impact you believe this will have on people electing to go into those areas and indeed the provision of those courses by universities.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           You were talking of the work you have done to increase the midcareer opportunities for graduates. Could you give us more explanation why then you have so extensively ramped up the cost of the PhD and master's by research? We have seen a cut to that area of $173 million. I understand that this now equates to a very, very significant increases in costs to those PhD students. Okay, we have put a little bit of money into the midcareer, but what I am concerned about is that we have really made it much more challenging for people to come in and do undergraduate degrees in science and engineering and then at that next level—those that want to go on to masters and doctorates—are now seeing their fees act increased substantially. That is obviously going to be a disincentive and disabler for those people who are not independently wealthy, like so many of the minister's colleagues, apparently. I would ask that you would address those two issues.

The member for Perth has to understand that this is an entire package of reform. There are elements of it in which the taxpayers will be making savings. So the Commonwealth Grants Scheme will be reduced by 20 per cent. That is definitely true. There have to be trade-offs in the budget for expenses to the taxpayer versus savings to the taxpayer. So while we are, as I said before, increasing spending on things like NCRIS and Future Fellowships and the demand-driven system being expanded to the sub-bachelor courses and of course the Commonwealth Grant Scheme being expanded to the non-university higher education providers, there will be a cut of 20 per cent of grand scheme across the board. I refer the member to the fact that I have established two working groups. One of the working groups will be giving advice to me in the coming weeks about the technical aspects of the clustering arrangements that she talked about. I am looking forward to getting its response.

That was the question asked by the member for Perth, and that is the answer. Eighty thousand more people will get to go to university and get the opportunity to improve their standard of living, their health, their longevity and their sophistication, if you like, through education, and they will get a 75 per cent, on average, increase in income. The taxpayer provides, at the moment, about 60 per cent of the cost of educating a student. The student provides about 40 per cent. After our reforms, the impact will be that we will be asking students to contribute about 50 per cent of the cost of their education. As

She wants to continue to run the universities from Canberra in terms of the demand-driven system. She probably wants to return to the old system of caps on undergraduate courses. She wants to tell the universities how they can much they can charge and how many students they can enrol. The government's view is that we want to give universities the freedom to make these decisions themselves, to set their own fees and to enrol the number of students that they want in sub-bachelor courses and undergraduate degrees. The effect of that is a massive reform of higher education that will have two very significant impacts. Firstly, it will let more young people into higher education. This will particularly help low-

It will give our universities the chance to compete with their Asian competitors, the Asian universities, which are improving in quality all the time. We have an international education market, which at the moment is worth $15 billion per annum. It was $19 billion under the Howard government. Labor managed to shrink that to $15 billion—quite an achievement in a growing economy—because they do not really support international education. We want to see our universities compete with their Asian counterparts. Five years ago, there were no Chinese universities in the top 200 universities in the world, in the

I am not prepared to be the minister that knows that danger is looming and not do anything about it. So I have made the decision to reform higher education to give more students the opportunity to go to university and to free our universities to be the best they possibly can be and to have the best quality higher education system in the world.

It wants to encourage people right across Western Sydney to learn and to enrol in tertiary education and has broadly welcomed the government's measures. As a response to the intense scare campaign conducted by those opposite, UWS has felt compelled to provide further confidence to their student community and has publicly come out to say that they will be freezing and grandfathering course costs to the student community. However, I would like to know how the minister's budget measures will overcome other potential barriers to accessing a tertiary education.

In fact, those students will go on to earn 75 per cent more on average than Australians who do not get a higher education qualification. I understand in low-socioeconomic regions there are a range of contributing factors and barriers to accessing education. However, with the disparity I have identified within my own electorate, I think there is a need to make a university education more accessible. Minister, the disparities between the two suburbs could not be clearer. My question is: how will the higher education reforms outlined in the budget increase opportunities for students in my electorate?

What she failed to mention, but I know that the community understand already, is that every single student, whether in Greater Western Sydney or in Walkerville in her electorate, will be able to borrow every single dollar up-front for the fees that they will pay to go to university. No student will be denied the opportunity to go to university because of cost—not one—because every single dollar can be borrowed from the taxpayer under the Higher Education Loan Program, which used to be the

That means that no matter how wealthy you are or how poor you are, you will have exactly the same opportunity to go to university in this country. That is why our system is so very different from the system in the United States. To compare the two is a very false comparison and is extremely misleading.

Our reforms will mean that people in North St Marys who might not be as well prepared for university education as others and who typically use pathway courses into university will be able to do so because we are lifting the cap on those pathways courses, those diplomas and associate degrees. They will now be under the same demand-driven system as undergraduate degrees. It is costing the Australian taxpayer to bring that about.

The Kemp-Norton report that I commissioned earlier this year and that was handed down a couple of months ago said that students who had done those kinds of pathway courses were much less likely to drop out in the first year of an undergraduate degree and that 24 per cent of students who had not done those courses dropped out in the first year of an undergraduate degree.

When I was at school I assumed that I would go to university, and I did go to university because I went to an academic school and I had every single advantage that a young person could have. So when I sat down I did not decide to have a higher education system that advantaged people like me; I decided that I wanted a higher education system that advantaged people from low-

Will they provide the data on the effect of the latest fee hikes which were announced in the budget? What will the effect be on Australian students and students who will not become students as a result of these despicable measures?

I must say, I find it hard to believe that she can reconcile a statement that we are cutting higher education with the facts that are found in the budget papers that clearly indicate that far from cutting higher education, we are increasing spending on higher education by $900 million over the forward estimates. And then I realised that it is possible that the member for Adelaide thinks that an incoming government simply spends on top of what the previous government did. It is possible that the member for Adelaide thinks—and she gave a litany of particular programs—that the new government keeps all the previous government's programs and then just adds its own on top of that, which would obviously be pretty costly.
                                                                                                                  </p>

They removed many of the Howard government programs. The one in education that leaps to mind was the vouchers for literacy and numeracy. That was an extremely successful program for young people learning how to read and how to count.

I will not get personal because the member for Adelaide has tried to avoid being personal, but I would point out that she probably needs a bit of a refresher course in how government works.

That is why, while the current HELP debt for the Commonwealth is about $30.1 billion, it will rise to $51 billion or $52 billion over the coming years. It is not a program that can be cut; it is a program that can be paid back at a fairer interest rate—for example, at the 10-year government bond rate rather than

In our electorate we have some 10,553 primary school students and we have some 911,000 secondary school students. We have heard from Labor that there have been cuts to expenditure on schools in New South Wales and across the country, but my understand is that we are actually boosting expenditure on schools. I would be interested to know, over the course of the next four years of the forward estimates, how much school expenditure will be increasing in New South Wales. I would also like a general assessment of the spending on independent schools and Catholic schools if the minister has that data to hand. My understanding is that, as opposed to what the Labor opposition have been saying, there has been an increase in spending on schools in New South Wales for both state and private schools.

I would like to understand more fully from you, Minister, how that deals with the sort of legacy that we have had to fix in this budget for 2014.

I might start with his last question first, if he does not mind. Yes, we did inherit a very poor legacy from the previous government around the outcomes for students at school level then going on to have difficulty in vocational education and training—a very difficult legacy.

This is a very fundamental problem. I do not blame any particular state Labor or Liberal government for that. This has been a decline over 10 years, but it happened at the same time as a massive increase in spending. There was a 42 per cent increase in spending in schools over 10 years; over the same 10 years, there was a significant decline in the outcomes for our students.

We decided to focus on the things that really mattered—not just more money in schools, which Labor is obsessed with, but the fundamental root problems in schools in the outcomes for students. We identified those as being, firstly, an improvement in teacher quality. The OECD said that, in eight out of 10 reasons why a student does well or badly in Australia, the classroom to which they were allocated had the biggest impact. One out of 10 reasons was low

So we wanted to address teacher quality, and what we can do at the federal level, of course, is address the training of teachers in universities. That is why we have established the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group, to advise me about how to improve teacher training at university and do an international benchmarking study.

I have seen the member for Perth support many of the government's measures around direct instruction or around independent public schools and I am sure she would want to support that, but, rather than be distracted, we have put $70 million aside to expand independent public schooling in Australia. I must say, we are close to securing all jurisdictions being able to take part in that particular program, because we want more autonomy at the local level.
                                                                                                                    </p>

Rather than accept mediocrity or failure, we decided that we would have a deep look at the national curriculum by appointing two very eminent people to conduct a study of the curriculum and its robustness. We wanted to determine whether it is useful for students and whether it produces the kinds of outcomes that employers need in gaining skills and knowledge, because being at school is not just about gaining skills; it is about gaining both skills and knowledge.

Therefore, the Independent Public Schools Initiative really dovetails into our initiatives around parental engagement. The budget has $1 million a year for ARACY, to assist us with good research and good methods to achieve better outcomes for students.

We have massively increased funding for schools—an 8.7 per cent increase this financial year; 8.9 per cent the following year, 8.9 per cent the following, and 6.6 per cent in 2017-18. We have increased funding. This stands in stark contrast to Labor in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which cut $1.2 billion from schools, which would have left Western Australia, Queensland and the

My question, Minister, is: what is the rationale for this? What are you putting in place to replace these really valuable resources, which I have used in a previous life? And how do you expect to help young people to find work and to undertake appropriate courses of study without having resources available for those people and for counsellors to provide counselling and advice on careers and education?

We did that, firstly, because we are in a budget emergency which requires us to make difficult decisions about what should and should not continue to be funded. Secondly, we did that because, with respect to those two particular measures that some students use to decide their careers and their futures, there is a plethora of information now available for young people, particularly provided by the private sector. Therefore the question has to be whether the government should be spending taxpayers' money on myfuture and the Job Guide when the private sector has been filling that space extremely successfully for the last 10 years. For example, there is information about careers on state and territory websites—Victoria and

So there are many different places that students can get the advice that they need about future careers. Of course, young people these days use social networking, social media, to find out a great deal about the careers that they might wish to pursue. So I am confident that the myfuture and job guide will be quite correctly replaced by the private sector filling that space, as they have already been doing in the last 10 years, and I think that for the use of taxpayers' funds where the private sector is doing a job equally or better than the government, it is the wrong use of taxpayers' funds to replicate what the private sector can do as well if not better.

The Commonwealth Grant Scheme has been applied to the 39 universities for many decades. The government's decision has been that we want to expand that to the non-university higher education providers, many of which are very high quality and are offering as good if not better courses and career opportunities for young people. When we come to decide the amount should be funded to those different institutions that are non-university, the percentage that we pay them might well be lower than what universities are paid. That is why we have a working group advising us on what, for example, that percentage should be, because universities do research. Being a university, one of the definitions is that they do research as well as teaching, whereas a lot of the non-university higher education providers, like

They will be big winners because some of their courses will be funded under the new demand-driven system for diplomas and sub-bachelor courses, so there will be an injection of funds to TAFEs through that method. They will also be winners because, for the first time, they will be able to access the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, and that will give them an opportunity to get an injection of funds that way. Around Australia—certainly in my state of South Australia—state governments have been cutting TAFE funding. So they have very much welcomed the decision by the government to expand that.

This is a minister in a Labor state government, in the state from which the member for Adelaide, the shadow minister, comes. I do not think they are from the same faction, though. I think Gail Gago is in the left and the member for Adelaide is in the right. I am not sure. They do not tend to talk closely in South Australia, but I am sure the member for Adelaide can inform us. In any event, this is a minister in a state Labor government who is supporting the federal government's proposals. Why is she doing that? Because they are good proposals. They are very good, and Gail Gago has worked out that what the government is doing is expanding opportunity to a great deal more students around Australia to get a higher education qualification. This will mean that students in Greater Western Sydney will have the chance to go to university, get a degree or a diploma or do a course, and then go on to earn 75 per cent more, $1 million more, over their lifetime than people without a higher education qualification.

There are many, many Australians who are pleased to support students at university by subsidising their education. At the moment, they subsidise it 60 per cent. As only 40 per cent of Australians have a university degree, that means that a great majority of the population are subsidising students to get the chance to earn 75 per cent more than them over a lifetime. It is a generous act on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. Rather than whingeing about it, the member for Adelaide should be thanking the taxpayers of Australia for the subsidies that they provide to students around the country.

We know that the budget outlines $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals. Its estimates also reveal that $30 billion of these cuts will come from schools. We saw that in this exchange between Senator Wong and Mr Ray, deputy secretary of Treasury, in an estimates hearing:

The public service has confirmed the biggest-ever cuts to schools that we have seen in this nation, and we know that there will be devastating consequences: less disability support, subject choices drastically limited, school support officers and teachers' assistants cuts, sport and music programs cut, remedial support cut and class sizes increased. But the government has made these cuts without any understanding of the impacts. We know that Senate estimates revealed that despite starting work on its $80 billion cuts to schools and hospitals before Easter, the government still has no idea of the impact on the classroom and had not done the work to look at the potential impact.
                                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                                             <p>

It is absolutely frightening that the government would make the largest-ever cuts to our schools with no idea of the consequences.

The government have walked away from the commitments that they have made time and time again, including the so-called 'unity ticket' before the election—and didn't they pull one over the Australian public with that!

And we have seen these attacks to the indexation of schools, which the now minister himself said, in opposition, were a 'frightening prospect'—to have indexation of three per cent. He is now happy to see indexation of just 2.5 per cent moving forward.
                                                                                                                             </p>

How can the government justify making $30 billion in cuts to schools without any assessment of the impact they will have? Can the minister guarantee that no school will close as a result of these cuts? Or can the minister outline exactly how much worse off each school will be because of these cuts? On what evidence about the cost of delivering high-quality school education did the minister base the government's school-funding model from 2018, which will index funding at just 2.5 per cent? And can the minister justify a school-funding model that cuts funds to schools in real terms and which schools have warned will lead to reduced programs and quality, and higher fees?

                                                                                                                              </p>

I suppose it is because she does not have as much experience in the opposition as she should have. But, nevertheless, I will attempt to help her with the misunderstanding that she has about how the school funding agreements work.

The forward estimates go for four years as well. So there is a coincidence: there is a four-year funding agreement; there are four years of forward estimates. Over the forward estimates, spending on schools increases very substantially. As I said in response to the member for Eden-Monaro's questions, spending in all schools, including recurrent and capital spending, over the next four years is: an 8.7 per cent increase in 2014-15; 8.9 per cent in 2015-16; 8.9 per cent, again, in 2016-17; and 6.6 per cent in 2017-18. So there are no cuts to school education in the federal government's budget. In fact, the opposite is true. We are increasing spending and we have our own programs such as: programs like the independent public schools initiative costing $70 million; programs like the response to whatever the curriculum review hands down; programs like $1 million a year to help us with parental engagement; and when the TEMAG, the Teacher Education Ministerial Adviser Group, hands down its report to me, funds have been set aside to be able to respond to that. So we are increasing spending.

In the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the previous minister, the now Leader of the Opposition, ripped $1.2 billion out of schools. So, ironically, while the shadow minister pretends that they were funding a new school funding model, in fact in

It took me as the Minister for Education not only to deliver a national agreement on the national school funding model over four years, bringing the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia into the model, but also to find the $1.2 billion so that the model would work. And I did so.

I will tell her that in 2017 we will sit down with all the jurisdictions and renegotiate a new school funding agreement. That will lead to more money in 2018 and more money in 2019 because obviously spending will increase on schools in line with the

The member for Adelaide knows that members of the government can ask any question they like during the 1½ hours of consideration in detail for education. She is welcome to divide up the time for higher education, schools and child care. She may well ask a question on child care, next, to the excellent assistant minister. But I would point out that she used most of that first hour asking about universities and then ran out of time for schools.

If she casts her mind back to 7 September last year, she might notice that Labor did not win the election. That is why members of her party are sitting on that side of the House. So she gets to ask the questions that she wants to ask, and members of the government get to ask the questions that they want to ask. If she does not like the process she should not take part in the process, because there are lots of members of the government who would like to ask questions and would like to hear the answers.

So we are massively investing in research in this budget. I have spoken earlier in the consideration in detail about how we faced funding cliffs for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Future Fellowships program. I found money for both of those programs, in spite of Labor only funding them for 12 months. Those were more of the landmines that Labor left for the incoming government, because even they had worked out that the public had lost faith in them as a government. They left two funding cliffs in NCRIS and the Future Fellowships, and I found the money and funded it.

I recommend it to the member for Moreton because it was in his city. And I recommend it to the member for Adelaide, who might not have had the opportunity to read it. Right at the end of that speech—if she only wants to read one paragraph—on page 17 of 17, Michael Gallagher said:

They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable … My guess is that the detractors of micro-economic reform in Australia’s higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.

They have found themselves on the wrong side of history. They have found themselves supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community. They have found themselves opposing the redistributive measures of the package, like the expansion of the demand driven system to the sub-bachelor courses, and the expansion of the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to non-university higher education providers and the Commonwealth scholarships fund. This is the biggest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history and will give many, many more students in both regional and rural Australia, as well as the cities, the chance to go to university.

It will allow them to put more effort and their own money into research and to determine the areas of research that they are best at and the courses that they offer that are their highest quality courses and fund and support those, rather than simply have every offering in order to be able to chase the revenue, which is how the previous government had established the university system. That is why these higher education reforms will make a substantial difference to young people from low socioeconomic status backgrounds in particular and allow universities like UQ to compete with their Asian counterparts.

                                                                                                                                      Knowing how desperate the government are to avoid accountability on schools and education questions, I am going to ask a range of questions on both schools and child care and ask that those which the government does not answer in this place be taken on notice.
                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                      My first point is around the school chaplains program. I note that the budget allocated $245 million for the National School Chaplaincy Program but that this minister decided to declare that this funding would only be available for religious chaplains and that welfare officers and other qualified counsellors would not receive funding under this program. We note that there are many indications of the government's hypocrisy—firstly, that it talks about school autonomy on one hand and on the other hand says that it will not give principals the option of deciding that a welfare officer is best for them. How does the government justify cutting funding for qualified welfare staff that so many schools rely on? Has the government undertaken an impact assessment of this change? I also note that the minister was bragging about reducing compliance on these school chaplains. How will the government ensure that the program standards and safeguards will be maintained? Why didn't the government consult with school principals and parents before making this decision? How many schools will lose welfare officers as a result of this government's decision? If the government needs to take this on notice, I understand, but can it provide a list of each school which previously had access to a non-religious welfare officer under this program?

                                                                                                                                      I also have a range of questions around the almost $1 billion in cuts to child care which this government has announced, including the $157 million cuts to family day care. Why did the government refuse to consult with the family day care sector before deciding to axe this essential support, which Family Day Care Australia estimates will make families have to pay an extra $35 a week in their family day care fees? What plans does the government have to make up for any loss of supply due to the cutting of these funds? Has the government undertaken any analysis on the areas of Australia that are most likely to be impacted by the changes? How will the government provide assurances that services have educators in areas where family day care is critically important?

                                                                                                                                      Regarding the appalling changes to and attacks against the means-tested childcare benefit which this government is so proudly bragging will only impact people who earn $42,000 or more, how can the government continue to push for a paid parental leave scheme that will deliver $50,000 cheques to millionaires whilst cutting the existing childcare benefit that people who earn just $42,000 a year rely upon? How will the government save $230.4 million from these measures if it is continuing to try and argue that black is white and this is not a savings measure and a cut? I ask the government to provide the House with a breakdown of how this figure of 500,000 families that will be worse off as a result of this measure was calculated. If the government has done no such analysis on the impact on families of various income levels, will it at least now do it and provide it to the House as this bill goes through?

I ask: will the minister guarantee the continuation of federal funding for preschools? Will the minister make a commitment to an ongoing partnership with state and territory governments to fund preschool programs?

Why is it that every youth unemployment prevention program is being cancelled in his portfolio?

I ask the government: if trades in schools and linking with industry is so important to jobs and Australia's future productivity then why are trades training centres and partnership brokers programs, which are providing an effective way of bringing industry in and of providing a pathway to work experience and employment beyond school, all being cut by this government that promised no cuts to education and seems to delight in delivering record cuts in that same portfolio.

Youth Connections was a program that had 74 per cent of its participants aged under 17. It is therefore the responsibility of the states and territories to provide that kind of assistance that Youth Connections provided. It was duplicating effort. There are lots of great programs, Commonwealth programs, state programs and territory programs but it is not the Commonwealth's responsibility to provide them all. The states and territories have to take responsibility for the things that are their area of responsibility.

If they have to borrow the money from overseas, they have no problem with that. In the Conservative Liberal and Nationals parties' world, we need to live within our means and we need to pay back the debt. Areas that are properly the responsibility of the states and territories should be delivered by the states and territories. That goes for the school chaplaincy program as well.

Mr Rudd supported the chaplaincy program. Julia Gillard opposed the chaplaincy program. She wanted to kill the chaplaincy program.

The compromise between these two individuals was that it would be expanded to welfare officers and counsellors. Welfare officers and counsellors in schools are quite properly the domain of state and territory governments. Now that we are in government, we have returned the chaplaincy program to which original intention, which is a chaplaincy program.

I would welcome them doing so but that is a decision that they should make and not be infantilised by the Commonwealth making these decisions on their behalf. I will end on that note and allow the Assistant Minister for Education the opportunity to respond.

I am happy to address some of the key points she has raised. The answers to all of those questions she raised around childcare benefit and childcare rebate could be found in the speech I made to the House both on the introduction of the bill earlier last week and the summing up speech this afternoon. I am happy to go over them again in the order that they were asked. I will address first the family day care matter.

This was a program that was only in existence after 2006 following which it exceeded its budget allocation significantly year after year. In fact, it was spiralling out of control in excess expenditure. So the audit office highlighted problems and recommended a review. The minister, now the shadow minister, sat on her hands and did nothing. It was a part of Labor's mess that we had to clean-up on coming to government.

I am happy to inform her that yesterday I had a very wide-ranging, productive discussion following on from earlier conversations, earlier discussions and earlier meetings between ourselves, the department and the sector. But I would like to let the shadow minister know that yesterday I had a particularly productive session with family day care stakeholders. The reality is that although this is a budget measure this year, this is not coming in for 12 months. There are no changes for 12 months and we will work together with the sector to support and to have strong family day care. With no changes the 12 months, the transition is workable, manageable and well-supported by the sector.

There were several problems that Labor did nothing to fix, but the main problem that we dealt with in the House today was the bill that we put through the lower House that paused the thresholds for the child care benefit and the child care rebate. Speaker after speaker, including the shadow minister in her question just now, referred to these changes as 'cuts'. In fact, they are not cuts. It is disingenuous, it is misleading and it is scaremongering to the parents Australia to describe something that pauses a threshold, which is a level of income at which you qualify for a certain benefit, as a cut when it simply is not.
                                                                                                                                       </p>

In fact, they are not. They are going to increase. That is because the quantum of that subsidy directly to the parents will continue to be indexed. The shadow minister knows that. In making political point after political point and rhetorical flourish after rhetorical flourish, she is in fact simply stating untruths.
                                                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                                                        The sheer hypocrisy of the stance that has been taken by Labor really is—and I know it is an overused word—breathtaking. That is because contained in the bill that went through the House today was the measure to pause the child care rebate. This was a measure that was introduced by Labor in its last budget. It was desperate to find savings. It knew that the sixth surplus that it predicted was not going to happen. There were six non-surpluses in a row. So it pulled savings out of midair—savings from everywhere. There were $106 million in savings from pausing the child care rebate. They paused the child care rebate for six years, but they did not actually put the legislation through to effect that. We were left to do the dirty work and to pick up the pieces.
                                                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                                                        As I said in the House today, it gives me no pleasure to be bringing in the savings that we know, as a responsible government, that we have to make. It gives me no pleasure at all, but I perfectly understand that the job has to be done. By putting in place Labor's own measure—which it did not have the guts to legislate and then made excuses about—and another sensible, moderate measure that simply lasts for three years until we get the budget back under control, we are participating in putting Australia back on a sustainable path. If anybody is interested in the child care needs of the modern economy in which we all live and work, then they must surely be interested in the health of that economy, in the productivity of that economy, in the participation of women in the workforce, in the health of families and in the quality of child care for children. All of these things are front and centre.

What a shameful legacy left by Labor. I am already working with my state and territory counterparts to reduce the regulation and red tape that surrounds child care operators and surrounds family day care, surrounds out-of-school care and adds to cost but does not add to quality. We are focusing on the relationship between the educator and the child, the early learning, the nurturing, the care but not all the book work. We believe that that will help relieve the upward pressure on costs. We look forward to your participation in the consultations that the Productivity Commission will have in the weeks and months ahead.

Just to remind the House: $27 billion, $54 billion, $47 billion, $43 billion, $18 billion and $49 billion. That is the massive national task against which this budget is framed. So each and every portfolio has had to work to find greater efficiencies. This portfolio has been part of that process.

I want to repeat that: they were paying $5 billion to one small sector with no strings attached. That is probably the largest transfer of funds in Australian history to one small sector of the economy within one short period of time. There was $1.3 billion of subsidies to the coal sector when they said that they were clamping down on emissions. None of which made sense. By contrast, the first of our major new expenditure items compares with a $30 billion set of transfer payments from the Commonwealth to firms under the previous government. We spend $2.55 billion, we withdraw a $30 billion set of transfers from the Commonwealth to the private sector, which in almost every case were being done with no strings attached whatsoever.

They were not given funding by the previous government. Both were overdue. Both have been funded. The final figure will be determined through a tender process, but I can safely say that, between the two, we have provisioned over $500 million. All up, it has been a very effective budget round, against a difficult national backdrop.

It does not, to the best of my knowledge and reading, mention cap-and-trade, an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax at any point in the documentation. I stand to be corrected, but on my reading that is a very clear position. Beyond that, what does it seek to do? It seeks to encourage two primary things. It seeks to encourage energy efficiency and the cleaning-up of coal fired power stations. Compare that with the carbon tax that we currently have in Australia. What you see here is a transfer of $5½ billion from the taxpayer to the brown coal generators, largely within Victoria.

They are also looking at cleaner transmission. They are also looking at general plant efficiency. All of these things are precisely the outcomes which we are considering under the Emissions Reduction Fund. It will depend upon proposals that are the most cost-effective and the cheapest, but it is absolutely clear that the power sector is already looking at those sorts of options.

This is something to be welcome and embraced. But let us not kid ourselves that this is anything other than an alternative to a carbon tax. The White House papers could not be clearer that this is not a carbon tax. They do not make any mention of a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade or an emissions trading scheme.

Let me give three examples: the city of Shenzhen gives away 100 per cent of its permits for free—in other words, there is no charge; the city of Shanghai gives away 100 per cent of its permits for free; and the city of Beijing gives away 99.9 per cent of its permits for free. The difference between what we have here in Australia and what we see in China is the difference between a bowling ball and a pea.

Australians of all walks of life rely on the bureau for their day-to-day weather forecast. Importantly, it also plays a role in forecasting extreme and unexpected weather events and, indeed, emergencies which we see in our nation whether they relate to flooding or extreme heat—which can lead to fire—or other extreme forms of weather. The bureau plays a critical role in ensuring that Australians are aware of those events in advance to the greatest extent possible.

The bureau's advice of expected rainfall and temperature conditions is very important to the planning of those businesses.

Again, the atmospheric conditions are so critical.

The bureau's good work in forecasting those events is well known, which makes it one of the most highly respected institutions in the nation.

I understand that the government has made some moves recently to invest in super computing technology, and I am very interested to understand the likely impact of technology on boosting Australia's forecasting capabilities and of the benefits that will be derived from that technology more generally.

Whilst he was a candidate, he worked hard to recognise that this was a fundamental local environmental issue. It is about the health of the river. It is about the health of the fringing communities. In particular, the green army program was announced at a Georges River site. We committed to a significant Georges River recovery plan and I am very hopeful that, in fact, the green army legislation will pass through the Senate, if it has not already, in the coming hours. The consequence of that will be that this program will be ready to roll out and the Georges River will include some of the first projects in the country.

In Sydney itself, only some years ago there was a massive and catastrophic hailstorm. In Toowoomba and the Toowoomba Range, we witnessed the most tragic of flood events only a few short years ago. The lesson from that is that early warning and early intervention are absolutely critical. So we as a government have provisioned to acquire a new supercomputer. This will be the eighth supercomputer in the series since they first began to be adopted. The hope is that there will be two key steps over the coming two years. Next year, we are due to acquire new satellite capacity, and the following year we are due to acquire a new supercomputer. It was a project that was, sadly, unfunded. It should have been funded. It was overdue to be funded and there was a black hole in the budget. Nevertheless, we have made space in order to find that funding. We have funded it fully. The funding is set aside to ensure that, once the tender process is complete, the supercomputer will be acquired.

                                                                                                                                                 Why is it important? It is important for rural communities because it provides early warning in relation to fire, flood and cyclone. In particular, the fire authorities currently use the existing supercomputer to provide early warnings about wind shifts, which are absolutely fundamental to fighting the fire and even more fundamental to protecting the lives of people in particular communities and firefighters. In the end, there will be fewer lives lost, we hope, as a consequence of this. What is the capacity upgrade? It is a tenfold increase in capacity. That allows us to run more cycles, to look at more activities on a commensurate basis and to give earlier warnings—in short, more data, more frequently, more accurately. That is what the supercomputer is about. For our urban customers, for the population of Australia, they can see if there is the risk of flash flooding, as we saw, tragically, in Toowoomba. If there is the risk of a hail event, precautions can be taken such as placing cars undercover. We cannot stop all of the effects of weather, but we can give people the opportunity to mitigate. That is a quick summary. It is an important acquisition and, at the end of the day, it is about better data for Australians and about saving lives.

Firstly, can the minister point to any modelling, conducted either internally by the department or under contract by an external organisation, around the likely abatement achieved through the Emissions Reduction Fund and its contribution to the five per cent target? In particular, does that modelling distinguish between abatement that is or is not consistent with internationally agreed methodologies? Regarding the Carbon Farming Initiative legislation that the minister introduced to the parliament today as the vehicle for this fund, obviously this essentially expands the land sector specific framework beyond the land sector to cover a whole range of other sectors that the minister would like to see covered by the Emissions Reduction Fund, including household and community energy efficiency and a range of others.
                                                                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                                                                  The economics of the potential abatement from these other sectors will obviously be different potentially to the economics of the land sector, yet, as I understand it, the government's intention is to asses all of the sectors on the same lowest-cost model. I am just wondering whether the minister can outline how the government intends to deal with those cost variations between those different sectors; and how an average weighted price disclosure, which is intended to provide the price signal for potential bidders, will have any validity if the contracts are highly variable.

The answer is very simple: we are using the lowest-cost purchasing model. That is the way to purchase abatement, and we are shamelessly, clearly, openly, purchasing abatement on the lowest cost. That was what we said we would do on 2 February 2010 and we have never deviated from that model. We have continued that through to this particular approach, and the answer is very simple: the clean energy regulator will produce a weighted average price for abatement and the way that purchasing will occur will be up the cost curve. So, as volume needs to be purchased, each successive unit will be acquired and, then at such time as the regulator has acquired all of the units which it needs to acquire, we will see a final price and that weighted average price is released. We are not differentiating by sectors and we have always said we would not do that.
                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                   As an example, if you have $100 to acquire units, you could acquire on a differentiated basis two units at $50, because you wanted to support a particular sector but you would only get two tonnes of abatement. Or you could acquire 20 units at $5 per tonne, if that were the cheapest. We will without doubt, without question, be purchasing the lowest-cost abatement. That was always our intention and that is how you can get the maximum efficient result for Australia. I think that that is very important.
                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                   Secondly, it is important to put this in the context that the world has two primary approaches. One is a carbon tax based system which is, for example, the European system—although they have high caps relative to actual production. They have more than 100 sectors carved out as being trade exposed, and many have said that the net contribution to emissions reduction is likely to be minimal, if not negligible, between now and 2020 such as the head of Point Carbon's research desk—Point Carbon being, arguably, the leading trading house in relation to the European scheme.

At the moment there are about 1.4 million tonnes of genuine abatement credits which are available internationally. The evidence is clear that the clean development mechanism, which is a model for what we are doing here, has produced genuine, low-cost abatement.

I will point the member to the work of Energetics. I will also point the member to the fact that the white paper sets out expectations. The modelling on which that was based is also set out in terms of the budget. The budget sets out a projected cash flow.
                                                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                                                   The full $2.55 billion will be available from day one. We have changed. We have made a policy change here: instead of the $2.55 billion being phased over four years, it has all been brought forward and is all available from day one. A projected cash flow has been set out, which is based on, obviously, the analysis of the department. What we cannot do of course is release the projected price, because that is commercial-in-confidence and would prejudice a Commonwealth tender. That work has been done. It has been done not just by us in terms of analysis; it has also been done by firms such as Energetics. What does it mean? We will achieve our targets and will achieve them easily. Most significantly, we will achieve them without a carbon tax.

My question will be to the minister, and I am sure that you would be capable of answering the question, as you indicated earlier, but I will make sure I address it to the minister! It is in relation to the Swan and Canning rivers in Perth, but first I want to provide the minister with some context, obviously, on environmental issues in my electorate of Swan—environmental volunteering and some previous approaches to the environment in my electorate.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                    As the minister might know, Swan is like an inland peninsula, surrounded by rivers on three sides while on the eastern side there is a series of small lakes and swamps. It is a very environmentally sensitive area; it is a bit of a jewel in the electorate because there are not many people who are aware of it. But I know that the minister has been down there; he visited it with me some time ago. I do appreciate that and the people of Swan appreciated his taking the time to come and look at that particular jewel down in the electorate.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

The only real negative to that was that about half a dozen planes flew over the top as we were doing it and scared them! But at the same time, the high aircraft usage over that area does have an effect on the environment down there.

Some of the degradation that we are still dealing with today includes use as a rubbish tip, which was on Burswood Island; dumping of toxic waste at Castledare in Wilson—chemicals being dumped in the area; asbestos being dumped in the area; and all of this, obviously, was not helped by antisocial behaviour like the dumping of shopping carts from the Carousel shopping centre.

They have also reduced the biodiversity. A serious example of this is the hydrocotyle weed, which is one of the things that I showed the minister when he came down and looked at the Wilson Lagoon. That was introduced to the river in the 1980s. For those who do not know, hydrocotyle is an imported pet weed. It was initially in fish bowls but it was released into the local river area, unfortunately. In the right conditions it can double its biomass in three days to a week, creating a green mat over the entire area—particularly on the Wilson Lagoon. Since then it has caused major problems, and periodically there have been very bad years of growth; for example, 1992 and 2013-14 have been extremely bad years.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

The Two Rivers Catchment Group has directed $27,000 as well over the same time, but a greater investment is needed to finally get on top of this issue because it is causing enormous damage to the environment down there. This was at the heart of our proposal to the minister for the Swan-Canning River recovery program.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                    Much of the work to remediate the environment will need to be done at the local level by local groups. And even when the funding is delivered the larger body of work also tends to be done at the local level. The majority of the action involves weeding, revegetation and removal of the hydrocotyle, which is a pretty difficult issue. I went down there myself with one of the Wilson Wetlands groups and with a group of schoolchildren from Wilson Primary School. I put on some waders and went out into the lagoon and removed some of the hydrocotyle in there. It is an extremely long process which will require a lot of time from the local environment groups.

                                                                                                                                                    In the past, the Howard government's appreciation of the need for environmental action at the local level has been a strong focus. The focus under Labor has been solely on climate change and offshore credits, neglecting on-the-ground action down in the areas. This was epitomised by the reduction that NRM had in their funding under the last government.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

And what funding has been allocated for the Swan-Canning rivers, and how will this improve the environmental health of the waterway?

Firstly and most significantly is weed removal, eradication and revegetation, as set out by the member. The hydrocotyle, as you have shown me, is a fundamental problem. Both rivers can be threatened by it. Each river has lagoon systems where the water is not running so quickly. I have with you inspected the site, seen the challenge and it was precisely because of those site visits and the support of the community and the state that we determined that this was a genuine and necessary problem. I know it affect electorates of all persuasions. The Labor-held electorate of Perth will also benefit significantly from this program, as it should. At the end of the day it is about maintaining and improving the health of one of our fundamental urban riparian assets.

It is about ensuring that the sorts of shopping trolley issues and urban pollution issues to which the member for Swan refers are mitigated—that they are reduced,. The lessons around the country are very clear: if you engage your school children early, if you engage your secondary school students, then you can have an impact on the community as a whole. We cannot guarantee 100 per cent community compliance, because that is the nature of who we are and what we are as a society, but we can make a dramatic difference.

It could be replanting, it could be riparian recovery, it may be the development of habitat for threatened species in particular along the Swan and Canning rivers.

But after consultation with the member, the significant condition which I had placed on it is twofold. Firstly, the condition is that there will be zero dollars used by the Perth NRM for administration—100 per cent of the funds, $1 million of the $1 million allocated, must be used for cleaning up river in the three ways outlined. That is a direct consequence of the rightful demands of the member for Swan that every dollar goes to cleaning up the Swan and Canning system.

That allows proper consultation and openly I say with the member here to ensure that he and other community representatives believe that all recipient bodies are appropriate bodies with full probity attached to them. We will, of course, do our probity checks but I wanted to make sure that there is a second line of defence. I think the member. This program would not have occurred without the support of people such as the member for Bass, the member for Boothby and the member for Swan and this project would certainly not have occurred without the tireless and indefatigable advocacy of the member for Swan.

Its functions include triennial assessments of the performance of the states, implementing the National Water Initiative, advising and reporting on performance of the water industry more broadly under the National Water Initiative, delivery of the planning report card on the status of water plans that are in place across the country and delivery of national performance reports on the performance of both urban and rural water utilities. As the minister also knows, the Water Services Association of Australia and the Australian Water Association have both expressed grave concerns about the abolition of the National Water Commission.

I wonder whether the minister can provide some more clarity around which functions currently undertaken by the water commission will be discontinued. For those that will continue to be undertaken, by whom will they be undertaken? If those decisions have not yet been made—if the minister is not able to answer those questions in detail—when will those decisions be made and announced to the parliament and, perhaps more importantly, to the sector and to the community? As I have outlined, the functions of the water commission involve very significant interaction with the states and territories but also with the water industry, represented by the two associations I referred to. I wonder whether the minister can detail the consultation undertaken with those bodies prior to the decision to abolish the water commission. Also, what discussions have taken place, in regard to those questions I have raised, with the states and particularly those party to the intergovernmental agreement, since the decision was announced to abolish the water commission?

This is done against the backdrop of an extraordinarily expensive national budgetary crisis which we have faced, so it is something that we have always intended to address and which we said we would address. The second background item here is that the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement has been completed. Much of the preparatory work for that has been done by the National Water Commission and we have seen, with the grand achievement of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement having been endorsed by all relevant states, that we now have an operating system which we can all be proud of.

That was its raison d'etre, its purpose, its reason for existence. We have achieved that primary outcome. Institutions at a governmental level are not necessarily meant to live forever. It is sometimes a mark of their success that they have achieved their outcomes. In a government with over 900 different agencies, organisations or commissions, if they can then be slimmed down to a number which might well end up being half of that then I think that is a sign of success.

It has really reached the end of its operation lifetime, which will be strung out for longer perhaps than it should be, but I am assured that all the safety protocols can be met. Nevertheless, we have needed for some years now a new icebreaker. In this budget we made the commitment to acquire a new icebreaker, and the funding has been set aside. There was a black hole—critical national infrastructure was not funded. It is now funded. The exact amount will be subject to a tender but, as I have said elsewhere and earlier, a global figure of $500 million covers the cost of the icebreaker and the

It will allow us to have a world-class research platform. It will allow us to have a world-class logistics and supply vessel. It will enable us to reinforce the bases at Mawson, Davis and Casey. In particular, it will allow us to ensure that our sovereignty is established beyond any point of doubt whatsoever. Under the Antarctic protocols and treaties, what is fundamental is usage, and if you are not maintaining a presence and usage then you place at risk your claim for sovereignty. For all those reasons, the new icebreaker is fundamental. But in terms of scientific research we could not have a more valuable fundamental platform.

That $48 billion serves many purposes. It serves purposes for general commerce, general tourism and general trade within Tasmania, but in particular it equips the runway to be a logistics hub for activity in and out of the Antarctic. When you put the new ship, the new research and the runway together, this is the biggest single investment in Australia's Antarctic program in Australian history. This is a very important step forward. It is critical. It is the right thing to do for the environment. It is the right thing to do economically, because many other countries have expressed deep interest in having Hobart or Tasmania as their logistics hub for Antarctic activities. And it is the right thing to do in terms of our national strategic interest.

Agriculture has been a vital industry and will be a vital industry for where our economy goes. It is a statement of fact that, if we did not have an agriculture industry, then we would not have the nation that we currently see. This nation was in the past strongly reliant on its development through agriculture, and I believe that that is coming back to the fore again.
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

I feel there has been a real return to the Australian people because of that. I note with some interest that, in the quarter ending in March, we had a 19.3 per cent increase in agricultural income, and it was 19.3 per cent in the same quarter in the previous year. This shows a trend, and this trend is underwritten by a whole range of factors that we have been concentrating on intently.
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

This brings substantial change to people's lives, who get the dignity of a substantial cheque coming through the door on the sale of sheep. This allows them to reinvest in their property and brings dignity into their lives by allowing them to do some of the things that everybody else takes for granted—maybe it is renovations around the house, maybe it is buying themselves a new car.

If their job is one where they cannot get all the social services that one would expect, living in an urban environment, then we hope that the quid pro quo is a reasonable return for their endeavours. I am also happy to see that, in the timber industry, we are getting a large pick-up in the export of timber. We had a record number of live cattle moved in April, over 170,000. Prior to that—I think in the month before that—we had a record amount of frozen beef, 108,000 tonnes. When you stack all these things against each other, you can see that agriculture is not only starting to provide a real return to the people on the land but also managing to help our nation.

Back in the month of January, we suspected that the nation would make a $100 million loss, a $100 million deficit. We actually made a $1.4 billion surplus—a $1½ billion turnaround. That was predominantly driven by agriculture. We had an excellent crop coming off in Western Australia—we got about 6.2 million tonnes of that onto the ships—and we had good outcomes in the live cattle trade, the live sheep trade and the export of frozen beef, chilled beef and chilled mutton.
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                                                                          Let me turn to some other areas. We have managed to finalise a free trade agreement with Korea, which has brought about a substantial reduction in tariffs, especially in the beef sector, and ultimately they will go down to zero. We have finalised a trade agreement with Japan, which has brought about a substantial reduction in tariffs. We are currently in the throes of negotiating the Chinese one. I have had discussions with the Chinese departments, and Minister Gao from China was here in the last fortnight. We were very focused on what we are doing there. Some of the increases in exports to China have been incredible. They have been 500 per cent in a year in some sectors. There has been an exponential increase in beef exports. These all augur well for a good outcome.
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                                                                          On the back of that we have also had to work closely on drought policy. We have been managing to deliver good outcomes on drought policy, good outcomes on infrastructure and great outcomes with the recent $100 million further investment in research and development in agriculture. That basically takes our total to around $700 million a year. I look forward to participating in this process over the next 45 minutes. We will see how we go.

I congratulate him on his tie. I do not know whether that counts as blue, but it is close enough. May the Blues have a great win tonight!

The minister and I have talked often about our best endeavours to take a bipartisan approach to this portfolio. We together believe it is too important an area of public policy to be playing political games with. We are very conscious of the very short political cycle at the federal level—three years—and the need for long-term planning and certainty in this sector.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           I am a little bemused though by the minister's own scorecard, claiming that everything that has happened in a positive sense in agriculture over the last 10 months has been due to the good work of the Abbott government. I challenge him throughout these 45 minutes to tell me how the rise in timber exports, the increases in frozen beef exports—and he mentioned that about four times—the bumper wheat harvest and the free trade agreements, signed or otherwise, are as a result of anything he has done.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           He will of course claim some success in the live trade. He is always very keen to mention that. He mentioned that four times as well. I often think that for the minister if it does not moo it does not matter. This is a very diverse portfolio. I understand how important the beef industry is in this portfolio but there are other dimensions, Minister, to the agriculture portfolio, including forestry and fisheries, which you decided not to include in the name of the portfolio.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           The minister can attempt to claim credit for all of these things but he will need to provide over the next 45 minutes some evidence of something he has done that led to the outcomes he has been talking about. Of course he will say that things have improved in the live trade sector. I have said many times that the pause in the live trade sector was unfortunate and I regret it. I would like to think that, if I were the minister at the time, there would have been other alternatives available to the government. I often also make the point that this country probably would not have the best animal welfare system in the world now—ESCAS—if it were not for the pause. It is doubtful that the industry would have ever embraced ESCAS if the industry had not been paused. Those opposite when they were in opposition always criticised ESCAS, but now in government whenever they are in a battle with those who have as their key focus animal welfare they invoke ESCAS as the great system that Australia possesses now as a defence against those charges.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           I believe the government has got off to a pretty slow start in agriculture, and I am here to help in any way I can. I think the agriculture white paper, while possibly justifiable, presents policy inertia for the country at a time when we are really in a hurry. We have hundreds of reports on reviewing the industry, reviewing our outlook and reviewing where we need to go as a sector. I think it is just time that we got on with it rather than spend a year trying to reinvent all those reports through the white paper. I notice the member for Hume here. He is the author of one of those very good reports. Maybe if the minister had just spoken to the member for Hume, we could all have saved some time.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           I am excited about the Agriculture portfolio and the agriculture sector. I believe that what I have described as the dining boom presents this sector with enormous opportunities. The extent to which we capitalise on those opportunities will depend on how hard we work at those aspirations. We do need strategic plans, proper assessments of where we are going, and we need a big injection of infrastructure in our supply chains. The dining boom is not going to deliver for Australia because we are lucky. The dining boom will only deliver for Australia if we put in the effort, have the correct strategic plans, we attract the investment we need in those supply chains and government policy is set correctly. Of course, it will not be just about larger volumes. It cannot be just about volumes. To pluck a number out of the air, we might be able to increase volumes threefold, but that will not bring us the dining boom as I aspire it to be. It is high yields and high-value products which will deliver off the back of the dining boom, and that is where we need to focus. R&amp;D will be very important.

Today one was the monkey grinder and the other was the clown—

But I do commend the shadow minister because I do believe that there is a general view that agriculture policy is similar to defence policy. It has to be consistent. We do not want wild oscillations of policy, because people on farms do not plan for three years, they plan for 30 years, and therefore we need consistency. I am sure the endeavours of both sides will be to make good decisions better rather than make holistic changes that create major uncertainty.

He has had very strong involvement at a personal level, owning a farm, in agri-politics and also in politics itself. However, I have to take up one thing straightaway. People ask: 'What are some of the major changes?' I will give you a major change between when the Howard government finished and when the Rudd-Gillard-whomever government finished. When the Howard coalition government finished, the budget in agriculture was $3.48 billion. In the last Labor budget it was $1.6 billion. So the Labor Party cut $1.88 billion over their tenure. This is a substantive change for our attention. I look forward to the opposition's policy showing reinvigoration for that. How their policy addresses some of the issues rests a lot on the shadow minister's shoulders. One thing I do want is real competition—competition of ideas—because that helps progress where agriculture goes.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                                                                                            I can quickly point to some clear changes. When we came in, we had the concessional farm finance package, which I acknowledge the Labor Party drew up but they just never signed it off. Because it was never signed off, it could not be delivered. We had a package which was not signed off and was not actually designed for the people who were to use it. We had to completely recalibrate it. Because we wanted to get all the states and territories signed off, we had to go around to get them all to sign off. To the extent it was designed, it was inoperable, because it wasn't signed off by all the states and territories. We had to do that and we had to reallocate money. So we had the same amount of money, God bless them, going to Tasmania—that is fair enough—as we had going to Queensland. One area was in the middle of a drought and the other area wasn't suffering the privations of a drought. We did that. It was the coalition that did that, and the people are getting that money because we organised that.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                                                                                            The next thing is we also found money for water—that is definitely something that we did; $10 million—and we have been receiving strong support in that policy initiative, because people like the capacity of getting new watering points out on their place. That is something we did.

It is amazing when people say, 'You haven't actually done anything in agriculture. You haven't got any money out.' That is an awful lot of money and it has been going out, and we have been doing that. So we did that.

I will ask the minister next time he gets to his feet to tell me exactly where. He has cited live trade, timber exports, frozen beef, bumper wheat harvests—and I assume he was referring to WA—and the free trade agreement. I ask him how what he describes as reconfiguration of the concessional loans package brought any of those outcomes; how additional money for water infrastructure, as he calls it, has brought any of those outcomes; how the family payment—and of course there has always been a family payment, Minister—has brought any of those five outcomes; and how the free trade agreement, which is not yet ratified, has brought any of those five outcomes you boasted about and claimed credit for tonight.

I wasn't sure where to start but you have taken us to the concessional loans scheme, so it is probably as good a place as any. You said, Minister, that you reconfigured Labor's concessional loans scheme. It is untrue to say that the states were not signed up. There was one outstanding state,

It is true that you took money off some states and transferred those amounts of money to other states—and of course the losers were the smaller states of WA, Tasmania and South Australia. You say that that was a ridiculous arrangement, because some of those states obviously were not suffering bad drought—partly true, Minister. But you have to recall that the concessional loans scheme wasn't a drought package; it was a drought relief package and, when it was constructed, the farm sector in Australia was not facing severe drought. It was never a drought package. Yes, if drought was one of reasons farmers were struggling to deal with their debt, then that would feed into that process. So it is wrong to say that, Minister, and you know it is wrong.

What consultation was undertaken with the smaller states before that money was taken? More particularly, the money you took away was more than the money you distributed to Queensland and

You made a commitment that that $40 million would be put back into the concessional loans system—that is, the original concessional loans scheme. I ask you: has that money been put back; and, if not, do you still guarantee that that $40 million will be returned to that particular package?

I remind you that you first announced that scheme late in February. We are now well into June and that has not been bedded down. You stand here and criticise the design of Labor's concessional loans scheme, which, as you know, is flowing to farm enterprises and farm families, and yet your own scheme is not flowing. So I would really appreciate answers to what I think are very, very reasonable questions.

You should not claim that that is a big step up by this government. We were happy to support the changes you made and facilitate them to the parliament, but you might tell me whether it is true that those who are in receipt of those payments are therefore denied certain social services under the rural counselling scheme. I was just outside Emerald last week and I was informed that people are being denied certain services under what is generally known as the rural counselling scheme because they have taken up the offer under that family payment arrangement. If you would confirm that for me, it would be very much appreciated.

Recently, we have had the Asian longhorn beetle, the brown mulberry longhorn beetle and Japanese soya beetles identified in some wood products. There were some press releases about it.

The statement made by the shadow minister of 'all but one' is incorrect. We had three. In the Commonwealth of Australia there are more than three states, last time I checked, so we had to get the others to sign off. We had to progress this deal. There is always an issue with picking up the paperwork from the Labor Party and trying to finish the job off. They never get there. It is always like a packet of poo tickets caught in the corner. You have to try to fix it up, sweep it up together and try to make some sense out of it.

It did make it vastly more restrictive than other states, and it was difficult for those farmers to get access to it. So what did we do? When we got the $320 million package through, we made it so that it was generic—so that people could get an equivalent loan in different states and territories. This is the sort of process you do to try to make a program work.

I think that, throughout the room, people understand that if we do not maintain our most competitive advantage—that is, our clean, green image—then we have real concerns. That is why, even in the last week, we have been on the front foot making sure we deal with the detection of three beetles. It might sound innocuous, but they were not George, Paul and Ringo. We had the longhorn beetle, the mulberry beetle and the sawyer beetle and these have the capacity to devastate our timber industry, as they have devastated Canada's. We have been on the front foot. We have been ventilating this issue. We have been making sure that we track it down. We have been getting the quarantine in place and collecting all but, we believe, a few pallets that are around Adelaide. This is where we have to make sure we have the competencies in that field that are so apparent in the

They could have been backpacking in Nepal. If they brought it in, we would have to shut down the beef industry, the sheep industry, the wool industry, live cattle exports—the whole lot. The whole lot would shut down. It is absolutely imperative that we keep up our image and we are doing that.

I challenge the minister when he is next on his feet to tell us what any initiatives of the government—this government—have added, in the course of the last ten months, to biosecurity in this country.

My advice was different. We will have to agree to disagree on that, Minister. But you did not answer my specific question, so I am therefore going to come to some conclusions about the answers. You chose not to guarantee this House that the $40 million would be returned to the original concessional loans package; therefore, I can only come to the conclusion that that money is back off to consolidated revenue and will be denied to the farm enterprises of this country.
                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                                                                            You did not deny that no-one in this country is a beneficiary of your drought farm financing package so, on that basis, I assume the answer to that is 'yes'—that is true: no-one is yet a recipient. You did imply that it is all fixed now and ready to go but my advice is still is that it is only Queensland farmers that have access to that scheme, so if you are not prepared to tell me otherwise then I think it is reasonable for me to assume, and for farming families out there across the country to assume, that that is also true. I would invite you to answer those questions.

                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

I made the point at the end of my opening remarks that it is research and development and innovation that, more than anything, is the extension that will bring us the real opportunities in the dining boom. I do note, and I congratulate the government, for fulfilling its election commitment to put an extra $100 million into R&amp;D—over a four-year period, I should mark. But that is a welcome thing. I invite more detail from the minister about how that money will be spent, and I also ask the minister: what the net effect of R&amp;D is in agriculture, given that it seems he did enhance R&amp;D spending on one side but cut R&amp;D funding to organisations like RIDC—the Rural Industries Development Corporation—to organisations like the

Indeed, this includes certain higher learning institutions. So I do ask the minister whether he can tell us what the net contribution to R&amp;D in the agriculture sector will be as a result of those two sides of the formula?
                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                                                                            I would also ask him about another very important area, and that is regional sustainability. It was a great disappointment to me that resource sustainability did not form part of his terms of reference for his agricultural white paper. I just do not understand how you can talk about agriculture's future in this country and the opportunities in Asia without talking about how we produce more food with the same limited and, in some cases depleted, people, land and water resources. That leads me to questions on a bill that has just been introduced today, and that is the government's Carbon Farming Initiative. He might want to address my primary concern in that area, and that is the likely noncompetitiveness of the agriculture sector when bidding for funding under that scheme.
                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

Therefore, I am concerned in this reverse auction-type arrangement that the government proposes in the parliament, that the agriculture sector simply is not going to be able to compete for funding under the new Carbon Farming Initiative, and therefore will be cut off from assistance under that scheme.
                                                                                                                                                                           </p>

So if the minister could help us better understand that, that would be very much appreciated.

It was efficient, it was fast and it was very well-respected. That has changed to an enormous degree. We are now the last place that chemical and veterinary medicines are brought to be registered. It must be remembered that we are not a big market in the scheme of things and a lot of companies feel that they do not need to cater for some of the things that we do need.

That was ludicrous, and it is good to be shot of it. However, that does not make or force the APVMA to meet time frames, which they have never done—they have ignored them in the past. It has not meant that they have to take notice, particularly with chemicals, of countries that are as good as the

They do very good work. The APVMA is not forced to make use of work they have already done. They always reinvent the wheel—the legislation allows them to. But as they have not done it at any time recently why would they want to do it now?

I am interested to know if we as a government are looking at making some of the testing contestable so that outside sources can come and do it—certainly as well and, I am sure, a damn sight faster than the APVMA does. They have enormous ability to help agriculture, which is not actually its job—its job is to protect people—by being fast and efficient, and a hell of a lot faster and more efficient than they are now. The fact that this is totally cost recoverable means that they feel no pressure to get a move at of the best of times.

It is obviously not good enough for a government to say that this is an autonomous body and they are a creature of government. We either force them to do what they should do well by making it contestable or by legislating to make them. I am very interested to hear where we are going on this. I appreciate the amendments to the legislation, but, to me, one of the biggest things facing agriculture is the bureaucracy and the bodies which we pay for and control working with agriculture and not seeing themselves as regulators and agriculture as their creature.

But I do hear what you are saying. We do have the discussions with the independent scientists, especially in more recent times on fenthion, to try to make sure that we can get the greatest amount of information that we can possibly get on how we can work with growers so that we can assist them.

He was saying that we were to quick and that it was not given the proper oversight and therefore the major chemical company felt that they were exposed because Australia in some instances is too quick in its registration of chemicals and they did not believe that their intellectual property was well protected in that space. However, I do note and I have noted from my own ministerial advisory council, precisely the issue is the member for Calare brought up, and that is that people want a greater capacity for APVMA to use existing knowledge as has been determined overseas and also to not completely go back over covered ground in registration of certain chemicals. I am having that discussion with APVMA via my department on precisely that.

I have a hesitancy to do that because, first of all, the Auditor-General has told me to have hesitancy because I am not allowed to. Apart from that, it opens a bit of a Pandora's box that every state then, when they want a levy, will arrive at the door of the federal government to impose it. Queensland has an alternate capacity to create a levy to control bovine Johne's disease themselves. I do not want to start picking up their washing.

I know the minister has spoken about that earlier, as has the member for Hunter. In the time that remains, my question for the minister is: how will the agricultural white paper help the farmers of Australia to capture the fast-growing opportunities in agricultural markets in Asia?

I want to get back to his concessional loan issue—I think it is only fair. With the white paper, we have had the issues paper out, we are eminently about to release the green paper, which is the range of alternatives, and from that we intend the white paper and its conclusion will be drawn down around about November or December. With this it will be able to cover everything from infrastructure, such as we are currently driving towards inland rail, creating greater connectivity between mining infrastructure and agricultural infrastructure. Also as part of that purpose I have been appointed as the Minister for Agriculture to be chairman of the dams committee. We all know that water is wealth and when the Prime Minister decides to have a dams committee and there must be an intention to build dams.
                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>

We are down to around 3½ now. If we continue on our way we are going to be down to about 2½ megs of storage in 2050. That is just insufficient. Australia has to take the next step in dams. This will be something that I hope we get, because I know the Australian people want us to take the next step—overwhelmingly. There will always be a contingent that lives with the benefaction of dams and the benefaction of so many resources, but they never want anyone else to advance their position. But I believe this nation in the dams committee, which is also an integral part and is meshed within the white paper, is going to be so very important in advancing agriculture in new parts of this nation, especially in the North.

In the Fitzroy catchment are some of the better dam sites in this nation. We have already been dealing with it. One of the biggest inhibitors of us actually progressing the dams issue in so many instances is excessive environmental green tape. We have the engineers that can do it, we have a workman who can do it, we have the plant operators who can do it, we have the farmers who can benefit from it and we have the hydroelectricity we can generate off it. The biggest impediment is ourselves. We have got to make sure that we reduce that impediment. Not remove that impediment completely, but reduce that impediment in certain areas to do something that allows us to progress.
