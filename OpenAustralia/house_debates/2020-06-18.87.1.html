         I do thank the member for Mallee for not just her question but for her continued advocacy for jobs in her rural Victorian electorate. She is a great advocate for regional infrastructure. She knows that local roads and community infrastructure are going to bring benefits, not just for her electorate but for electorates right across the country. These packages are delivering a $1.8 billion benefit to communities across the nation. JobMaker is being bolstered by our $100 billion pipeline of investment over the next decade, making sure that we, through the back of COVID-19, reconnect people with work. Of course, through the JobKeeper program and through other programs, we have engaged businesses to try to remain open as best they could but also to continue to employ people. It's all about jobs. Our policies are focused on making sure people are in work and making sure that there are jobs available.
        </p>

         In Mallee, we're building the Mildura South Regional Sporting Precinct. It's a $17½ million commitment. The precinct is predicted to attract 200,000 visitations per year. It will involve the construction of a full-sized
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rules" rel="nofollow">

         footy field with a 124-space sealed car park. It is expected that there will be 90 per cent local employment in its construction. I hear that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Tigers" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         —which I know the education minister will be delighted to hear—are interested in playing a practice match there. The project is progressing ahead of schedule. South Mildura Sporting Club President Mark Bresnehan said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is going to provide amazing opportunities … This new precinct is not just about providing a home to the stakeholders directly involved, it's going to have a significant impact on the whole community …
        </p>
        <p>
         For the South Mildura Football and Netball Club, their footy glory days were in the late sixties. They won the 1968, 1969 and 1970 premierships of the Sunraysia football league. It's a good competition. They're the Bulldogs. We want to put more bite into them and we are doing just that.
        </p>
        <p>
         But that's not all we're doing. There is a $1.49 million grant for the Horsham Livestock Exchange. That's 15 to 20 jobs in the construction phase with the provision of fixed roofing on the 23,400 square metre yards to provide shelter and shade. I have been there with the member for Mallee. I know how important a project this is. This livestock exchange generates more than $70 million worth of livestock sales annually. They're big projects. They involve jobs and regional development.

         , Mayor of Horsham Rural City Council, said, 'The Horsham Livestock Exchange project is providing jobs in our community right now and will deliver an industry-standard facility that will be best practice, helping to keep animals and workers safe.' That's what it's all about—creating jobs, creating opportunities and creating work for people in that wonderful seat of Mallee, which is so well represented by the member.
