       <p>
        I rise this evening to talk about current developments with underground power in my electorate of Swan. I appreciate that within our system of government underground power is considered to be constitutionally a state and a local issue. However, the volume of constituents that contact me regarding the issue makes me feel that I must raise this in the House. The constituents of Swan often remind me that they do not mind which level of government I am in; they just want some help in getting answers and ideas on where they stand on these issues. I have had inquiries on this issue as well as on the underground sewerage program since the day I was elected and I will continue to provide updates and information as they become available.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the Office of Energy, the government of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        has a long-term goal to have at least half the houses in Perth supplied with underground power by 2010. Forty-seven per cent of the metropolitan area is now serviced by underground power and the Underground Power Program has reached round 4. In a city bursting at the seams due to an influx of people who have come to WA to work, including in our resource sector, it is vital that we continue to provide the necessary infrastructure to keep our city up to date with essential services that are as reliable as possible. Underground power is preferable not just on aesthetic grounds; underground powerlines are more reliable and less susceptible to failure after weather events. In fact, the state government’s policy was developed following an inquiry into the May 1994 storms. These storms were widespread and caused significant power outages throughout the metropolitan and outer metropolitan areas of Perth. Eighty per cent of the damage to powerlines was caused by trees, and therefore a program to introduce underground power was promoted.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I previously stated, the program is now in round 4—it has operated in a series of rounds and all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        local governments have been invited to submit expression of interest proposals for funding. The program has proven popular with areas of my electorate. The scheme has led to plans for major residential projects in Como, which was round 1; Rivervale, South Perth and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         East Victoria Park
        </a>
        -Carlisle, which was round 2; Victoria Park south and Como east, which was round 3; and Wilson west, which was round 4. Additionally, the scheme has led to plans for localised enhancement projects in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Albany Highway
        </a>
        , Victoria Park and Belvidere Street, Belmont as part of round 4.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to update the House on the information I requested and have received from the WA Minister for Energy, the Hon. Peter Collier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">
         MLC
        </a>
        , about this program in Como East and Wilson West. In round 3, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         City of South Perth
        </a>
        submitted a proposal for the Como east area, which was short-listed for further development as part of the detailed proposal stage, with a view to approval and eventual implementation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the condition of state government funding is clear evidence of substantial support from the ratepayers within the project area. I am informed by the minister that a City of South Perth survey conducted by a reputable research firm demonstrated that almost 80 per cent of the respondents chose to replace the overhead powerlines with an underground system. I would like to inform concerned members of my electorate that the City of South Perth is offering discounts on the rates of those eligible for a pensioner or senior discount.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most common concerns I receive from my constituents is that seniors will not be able to afford to pay the council charges. Despite the City of South Perth’s survey indicating that a higher proportion of pensioners, 82.8 per cent, than nonpensioners, 79.6 per cent, would prefer to pay for underground power, we must remember the minority who have been particularly affected by the global financial crisis. I therefore would urge local councils to provide as significant a discount as possible to pensioners who are struggling at present. Councils can provide a discount to pensioners of up to 50 per cent under this scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next I want to mention the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Canning" rel="nofollow">
         City of Canning
        </a>
        ’s proposal for the major residential project in Wilson West, which has been short-listed and is currently undergoing further development through the detailed proposal stage, with a view to approval and eventual implementation. Further development will determine the scope, budget, community support and other essential aspects of the proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the installation of underground power has been a goal of successive governments in WA. Although it is a necessary development for the local area, it is important to ensure that vulnerable groups like seniors, pensioners and disabled pensioners are properly subsidised. I will continue to provide support to those who need it.
