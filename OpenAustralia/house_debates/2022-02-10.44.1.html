       <p>
        Last Friday, the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, the member for Goldstein, and I had the pleasure of visiting the Centre for Women &amp; Co. in my electorate of Forde. It was an absolute delight to award a Powering Communities grant to the Centre for Women &amp; Co. to install solar panels on their roof. Stacey and the passionate team at the Centre for Women &amp; Co. provide a critical service to our community, supporting female domestic violence victims and supplying women's wellbeing services to the community, not only in my electorate of Forde but across Logan and to the Bayside as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre offers women's touchpoints for knowledge-sharing and development, to enable informed choices around health, finances, holistic wellbeing and relationships, delivered with integrity, compassion and respect, through the expert team of qualified professional counsellors in specialist fields. As with any of these grants, they go a long way to assisting community organisations that do so much good work, to reduce the costs of operations, so that more of the money that they have can go to providing the actual services that are needed for the women in our community. And, at the Beenleigh office, this will be exactly the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the Centre for Women and Co. for their tireless work and their continued efforts in our community. I wish them every success for the future.
