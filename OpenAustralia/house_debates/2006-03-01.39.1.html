        My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister outline the government’s ongoing commitment to Australia’s armed forces?

         I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He served for 22 years in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army

         , including being an Army test pilot, and his values and his hard work were welcomed warmly into the Liberal family only two years ago.
        </p>

         On 1 March 1901, the Australian Army and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Navy
         </a>
         were formed. Today recognises and celebrates the 105th anniversary of these two great services. Throughout that period of time, over more than a century, those values of hard work, idealism, self-sacrifice, comradeship and courage have played a very important role in moulding Australia’s identity. Most importantly, today they are reflected in the service of almost 2,000 Australian service men and women who not only are protecting and securing Australia’s borders from illegal immigrants and illegal fishing but also are in

         and the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         It is extremely important to us as a government to say on behalf of Australians how enormously proud we are of our service men and women, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are determined to continue to support them. We will not under any circumstances cut and run until the task before them is complete. I join you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister in recognising Sir James Killen, who himself was a former distinguished Minister for Defence. Remember that date of the establishment of our Army and our Navy: 1 March 1901. For any Australian and any parent who has a son or a daughter who wants to make a real difference not only in our country but throughout the world, the number to call is 13 1901. If anyone on the other side is looking for employment, you are never too old.
