        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women. How has the Albanese Labor government delivered for Australian women in its first 12 months?

         I thank the member for Jagajaga very much for her question. I know that the status of Australian women is a topic close to the member's heart, and I thank her for her ongoing advocacy for women in her own community and also across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, 12 months ago, Australians voted for a better future, and over our first 12 months in office our government has worked hard to deliver on our commitments to begin laying stronger foundations to support women across this country. In 12 months, we've embedded women's economic equality as a core economic imperative through prioritising gender equality as part of the September 2020 Jobs and Skills Summit. You heard from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations the important role that that has played in getting employment for women but also getting wages growth for women.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've backed this up with investments of billions of dollars across our first two budgets. That includes targeted cost-of-living relief that supports women who are experiencing the most disadvantage, including by increasing the eligibility for single parent payments so parents can access it until their child is 14; investing in early childhood education and funding the biggest boost to paid parental leave since its establishment in 2011; and supporting a pay increase for aged-care and low-paid workers, who are overwhelmingly women, and funding this increase in the budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've led negotiations with the states and territories to finalise the National Plan to End Violence against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
          Women and Children
         </a>
         and backed that up with record investment of $2.2 billion in the budget. We have, of course, legislated paid family and domestic violence leave and funded and legislated all 55 recommendations of the
         <i>
          Respect@Work
         </i>
         report. We've passed legislation to publish the gender pay gaps of employers with 100 or more workers, a key reform to drive transparency and action towards closing the gender pay gap. And, importantly, we've introduced amendments to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         to ensure that it is less traumatic for women and children impacted by domestic, family and sexual violence. We've done a lot in the first 12 months, but there is much more to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         These policies, this legislation, do not happen by accident. Having women at the table, having women at the cabinet table and having women here in parliament actually matters when it comes to gender equality. I note that, while just 27 per cent of the previous government were women, more than half of the members of the Albanese government and just under half of the cabinet room are women. It actually matters when it comes to making policy. It's been a big 12 months when it comes to making sure we embed women's equality and gender equality in the policies of the Albanese government and taking action, but we know we've got more to do and we're up for the job.
