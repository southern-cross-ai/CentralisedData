        When will the minister admit that the Albanese government's disastrous renewables only energy policy is leading Australia in the wrong direction?

          I thank the honourable member for her question. She asked about the government doing more. Perhaps the honourable member might have voted for bill relief; that might've been a good start. Perhaps the honourable member might have voted for coal and gas caps, which were one of the factors in yesterday's announcement of reducing energy prices, including in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
           Western Sydney
          </a>
          . As I said yesterday, I would have thought any honourable member would welcome the announcement yesterday of reductions in energy prices. There is a lot more to do; no-one should be complacent and no-one should suggest there aren't pressures in the system. But honourable members can suggest that the government could and should do more, and honourable members could have voted to do more when they had an opportunity—including the member for Lindsay, who voted against bill relief for her constituents and voted against coal and gas caps which helped her constituents.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to Endeavour Energy, as I said yesterday, there is a 1.9 per cent reduction.

            There is a 1.9 per cent reduction up to a 7.1 reduction for residents, and a 4.4 per cent reduction for small business is a welcome sign. Of course there is more to do, and there always will be. But as we do more, I doubt we'll get any support from the member for Lindsay or her colleagues.
