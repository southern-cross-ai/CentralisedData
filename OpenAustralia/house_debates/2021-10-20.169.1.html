        As the Prime Minister has said, things have changed. There is now an economic transformation in progress around the world. Regardless of what might some may say, there is an economic inevitability to this transformation. We need to chart the best possible course. Building to this point has taken months and years of technological development and building of businesses, of developing trade partnerships and building new infrastructure. All of this takes time. What I'm talking about is the clean energy transformation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As John Howard said, you can't fatten a pig on market day. So too for our clean energy technology transformation, a commitment to it can't happen overnight. We need a plan that is achievable, accountable and economically viable and that plan has been under development for years. It has resulted in the release of Australia's first low-emissions technology strategy and technology investment road map, with the next annual update due next week. We are making a shift to a long-term commitment to a net-zero future because we know we should and we know we can. We don't believe in offering false hope with hastily made targets on the run. If we commit, Australians can be confident that we will deliver.
       </p>

        We on this side are doing the hard work right across the economyâ€”energy, transport, manufacturing and agriculture. Through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and

        , we are investing in scalable, commercial clean-tech solutions to fuel our manufacturing and export sectors. Our five clean-tech commercial stretch targets, which, by the way, the

        The significant amount of work from this government to build a plan for our future has reached a momentous point, not only for our environment but for our economy. I'm proud that since day 1 in this place I have been working hard each and every day inside the government for this. Even in my first speech I said climate change is real and it affects us all. It is not just an environmental imperative to act; it's an economic one and it's clearly now an economic inevitability. I look forward to the

        delivering the message to Glasgow. Australia is leaning into the clean-tech evolution, one I am confident we will help deliver for the world. This is a pivotal moment in our history.
