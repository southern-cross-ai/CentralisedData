        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the resolution fixing the presumption of debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022 for the next sitting being rescinded and the debate being adjourned to a later hour this day.

         I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this motion but, for the benefit of the House, perhaps clarify exactly why we are in this position. This important Treasury bill was introduced this morning. It appears that although the intention always was that it be adjourned for debate later this day the Speaker put the question that the resumption of debate be made an order of the day for the next sitting rather than later this day. That motion was put by the Speaker and was carried by the House. No objection to that motion was raised by the Assistant Treasurer, who was at the table, and apparently had carriage of these important bills which are, obviously, crucial to pass today, and I think everyone in the House understands why. The live minutes recorded that the bill had been adjourned for debate later today but it was quite clear that the recording of proceedings in the House showed that, actually, the Assistant Treasurer had allowed or acquiesced in the debate being adjourned for the next sitting, which would obviously be an incredibly difficult position for the government and for the Australian people more broadly. We want these bills to be dealt with today. The shadow Treasurer has made that clear. But I think it was important that the House has clarity as to why we are having to deal with a suspension of standing orders that has been moved by the minister at the table.
