        I rise today to talk about the Solomon local sporting grants that have been awarded in my electorate for round 2 and round 3 for the financial year 2012-13. Grace Fuller, who is from Nightcliff, travelled to Tamworth for the Australian under 16 basketball championship. Matthew Southwood travelled to Adelaide for the Australian schoolboys under 15 hockey championship. Lauren Northcote travelled to Canberra for the under 15 national women's hockey tournament. Made Budalasia travelled to Nowra for the 2012 Under 13 Boys National Championship. Bayley Valentine travelled to Chengdu for the Ninth Asian Youth Girls' Volleyball Championship. Ewan Gerken travelled to

        national youth championship. Elizabeth Paice travelled to Brisbane for the under 12 touch football championship. Jordan Carriera travelled to Brisbane for the School Sport Australian touch championship. They were all the round 2 grant winners, who received $500 each. Their parents were absolutely delighted because, as everyone knows, Darwin is a long way away from all the other jurisdictions. I remind all of my colleagues that Darwin is closer to Asia than it is to any capital city in Australia.

        The round 3 winners of the Solomon sporting grants were Ben Lye, who did the under 14 tennis championship. Friends Zain Dilshad and Steven Sawyer went to the

        national championship in Brisbane, and I was fortunate enough to see both of them there. Connor Wright, who does both athletics and hockey, went to Perth for the junior athletics championship. Lachlan Boye and Isaac Boye went to Adelaide for the swimming championship. McKenzie Lawrence went to the under 15 Northern Territory Australian football championship. Jackson Tremlett went to the basketball school championship. Emily Stephenson went to the under 13 hockey championship in Tamworth. The under 18 girls basketball team travelled to Brisbane for the national junior basketball championship. They were Caitlin Chamberlain, Lucy Murray, Kelli Sealy, Telecia Browne, Reina Shean, Tara Maxwell, Emma Carbone, Rochelle Fejo-Tasker, Ashleigh Mclean and the team manager Monika Stenberg.
