       <p>
        I support the previous speaker's comments on men's sheds and the wellbeing and health of men. It is a great initiative and should be applauded at every opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise to take the opportunity to congratulate and thank a couple of personalities from my electorate, in particular the state members from both sides of the house who have been extremely supportive to me personally during the time of hardship in the

        with the devastation of the disasters we experienced earlier in the year. In particular, the local member for Lockyer,

        , was a strength for me. He knew the majority of the people in the community and not only did he know them, he knew their children, their background and their religion. He is a state member who is extremely well connected with that community. I take this opportunity on the floor to acknowledge the great work that he did during that drastic time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ros_Bates" rel="nofollow">

        , the member for Mudgeeraba. At the weekend she took time out to take me around and introduce me to a number of business houses over there in her electorate. She is well received in her electorate and has a strong profile and does a great job over there. Also there is Dr Alex Douglas, the member for Gaven, whose wife does a magnificent job with the Gold Coast Council. I congratulate all of their staff on the job well done.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate

        , the Speaker of the Queensland house, for a magnificent term in parliament. John is the Labor member up there for Logan, who announced recently that he will not be contesting the next election. I would like to take the opportunity to thank him for the work that he has done for that electorate.
