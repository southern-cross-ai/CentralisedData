        In language schools across our country, thousands of first generation Australians teach their second generation kids a language other than English. They do this in the hope of keeping their heritage, their culture and their identity alive. On 21 February 2024, countries around the world observed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mother_Language_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Mother Language Day
        </a>
        . On this day, millions of people celebrated their traditional languages, cultures and customs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a multicultural country such as ours, multilingual education is important. International Mother Language Day aims to preserve and protect languages from extinction. Around half of all languages today are classified as endangered, and over 1,500 are expected to go extinct in this century alone. This threat is existential to those communities. With the rising tide of tyranny across the globe, celebrating multilingualism can help inoculate liberal democracies such as ours. We've seen this time and time again. When one group sets out to oppress another, language is often the first victim. As a beacon of multicultural success, Australia must embrace multilingualism in our stand against the global tide of tyranny and illiberalism.
       </p>
       <p>
        International Mother Language Day is particularly important to my electorate of Parramatta. Over 60 per cent of people in Parramatta speak a language other than English at home. In fact, Parramatta has the second highest number of multilingual residents in Australia. This makes Parramatta one of the best examples of multiculturalism within Australia. Its success is proof that diversity and tolerance can be among our greatest strengths as a nation.

        The 21st of February also marks the day when the Bengalis fought for the recognition of their Bengali language. International Mother Language Day is widely recognised as one of Bangladesh's most successful cultural exports. Members of the Bangladeshi community in my electorate are some of the most passionate advocates for International Mother Language Day. They're proud of their culture and rightfully so.
       </p>

        I want to acknowledge Riz Chowdhury, who has long championed International Mother Language Day. Riz and I first met during the 2022 federal election campaign, when he volunteered as part of my campaign team. Since then, Riz's positivity and infectious passion for Bangladeshi culture have become a constant across the community in

        .

       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge Parramatta local Nirmal Paul as the founder and chairperson of the Mother Language Conservation Movement.
