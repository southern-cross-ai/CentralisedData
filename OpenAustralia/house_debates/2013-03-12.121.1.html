        , was a particularly sad and poignant day for the Dunkley community. Dame Elisabeth was a local resident and had inculcated herself into so much of the life of the local community. We knew her as a neighbour, as a friend, as a patron to many organisations and as an inspiration to many local people. There was a wonderful tribute paid to her not just as a one-way gesture but as a statement of mutual support in the establishment of the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, which is located in Langwarrin not far from her home. They have benefitted from the guidance and wisdom of Dame Elisabeth and from the example that she set for and the encouragement that she gave to the students. She had a genuine commitment to the success and vitality of that school community. In return, the school community has honoured her for many years and they were particularly saddened by her passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        That day, 6 December 2012, was a day when we lost a great national identity, a remarkable woman who fostered optimism and new possibilities. She was also an incredibly generous spirit and highly respected among the local community. Even in recent weeks, Cruden Farm, that delightful home that Dame Elisabeth raised a remarkable family in for generations, has still hosted community organisations, celebrations, events and fundraising for community groups who might not otherwise be able to access an opportunity to use such a splendid and special place. It is in reach of so many.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also remark on the very particular sadness that her dedicated staff felt upon Dame Elisabeth's passing. I have known a number of them over many years. They are widely recognised, particularly the gardening team under the leadership of her gardener, a fellow green thumb and gardening traveller who has been so much a part of Dame Elisabeth's expression of commitment to Cruden Farm and the majesty of that property. I cannot imagine the loss that they must have felt. I have spoken with a number, including at the funeral. They have a very raw and real sense of grief at the passing of someone who so much a part of their lives as they were a part of Dame Elisabeth's life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her life was one lived with purpose and passion. She was not wishy-washy on many views. She had strongly held views, but arrived at those views after careful consideration. She was devoted to her family and very dedicated to the many medical, artistic and community endeavours that benefited from her drive and generosity. Much will be written about Dame Elisabeth's invaluable contribution to and support for national significant cultural, scientific and medical organisations. But she had a profound impact on the course of the lives of many who her work touched.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, perhaps you and others might be aware of the world-class McClelland Gallery, a sculpture facility of high quality dedicated to sculpture on a property that spans many hectares, including bushland areas of high environmental significance punctuated by remarkable works of sculpture. Dame Elisabeth was a benefactor of and an inspiration for that gallery for many years. It will also be a lasting tribute to her passion, her support, her personal encouragement and her engagement with local artists and community organisations—but one example of the very meaningful and lasting legacy she leaves our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned Cruden Farm. Dame Elisabeth was a very willing and keenly engaged host, opening her family home and the remarkable gardens to so many. It brought great joy and delight to countless worthwhile causes. Everyone loved exploring that garden. Who would have thought that in the outer suburban areas around Frankston would be—as I used to say to Dame Elisabeth—the Langwarrin botanical gardens? It was actually her family property. She planned and nurtured that garden over decades, over generations, with such thoughtfulness. She was extraordinarily proud of that property. As I said, her partners in the remarkable endeavour, the gardening team, were so devoted and so committed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That garden caused me to learn a bit more at Dame Elisabeth's urging. I was fortunate to be, from time to time, invited as a guest. We would sit and talk over lunch about some of the challenges, the pressing issues, of the world, and occasionally we would talk about the goings-on within her family. They were lovely luncheons. On one occasion she asked whether I could be of assistance to her. I was always keen to support her work as she in turn supported the work of so many in our community. She was passing off one of her patron roles because as her life progressed her remarkable energy was maintained, but the spread of hours over which it was applied had to be curtailed, at the advice of those who cared for her. I am sure my friend and colleague might be aware of some of the gardening varieties that are collected. She asked me whether I would be happy to be a patron of one of the floral societies down our way.

          It came as a bit of a shock. I thank the member for Kooyong for pointing out my obvious deficiencies in this area.

          No, you are very kind not to point those out! It was a wonderful discussion. Dame Elisabeth said, 'Bruce, what do you know about orchids?' I said, 'Dame Elisabeth, what I know about orchids you could write in crayon on the back of a stamp.' She said, 'Perfect; you will enjoy much in learning about orchids.' I said, 'I do have the odd orchid or two.' She said, 'I would be really grateful if you would relieve me of the responsibility of being patron of the

          Orchid Society.' I said, 'Obviously the criteria has been relaxed significantly, to go from your good self to me, but if I can help out I would be happy to.' I learnt so much about orchids. I did my research. I was happy to present prizes at the annual show.

          Not colour but hues, the various varieties within the genus and what was discovered in any given year. I remember vividly her encouragement to be the patron and to present the prizes at the annual show. I brought along my own creation one year—that was my then newly-born daughter, who gained a sash as best of breed at the show. She was not quite an orchid variety but she carried the gene pool of my sweetheart, Kate.
         </p>
         <p>
          They were some of the wonderful memories that I have of a remarkable woman. Her extended family I have, through public service, been pleased to count as acquaintances over many years. Our thoughts will continue to be with Dame Elisabeth and with her extended and extensive family. When I was shown some of the family photographs of the Christmas gathering I was not sure it was not the crowd at the Dolphins footy finals, but, no, it was the children and the cousins. It was quite a turnout but a time of great joy for Dame Elisabeth.
         </p>
         <p>
          She has an extraordinary network of beneficiaries from a life of selfless service and generous community engagement. The support of her family, her personal staff and a network of confidants has enabled Dame Elisabeth to achieve so much and to touch the lives of so many. I miss her. I miss her insights and that sparkle in her eye that I will always remember. Her passing will leave a massive hole in our local community, as a friend and as a neighbour, as a contributor and as a remarkable individual who lived as an enduring example of a long and purposeful life splendidly lived. The community that I represent in the greater Frankston-Dunkley area will forever remember Dame Elisabeth for her caring nature, her warmth, her kindness, her generosity, her integrity. We were thrilled that she was a neighbour and a friend—an inspiration. We have been blessed that she has been part of our community.

           I join the member for Dunkley in expressing sadness at the passing of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Elisabeth_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
            Dame Elisabeth Murdoch
           </a>
           , but also recognition of a life well lived, a life lived to the full and a life that achieved so much not only for the local community but also for the community of Victoria and for the people of Australia. Her family can be rightly proud. Although from humble beginnings, she really made the most of the opportunities that she had. Like the member for Dunkley, I share the distinction of having been a local member for the Langwarrin area, albeit for a shorter time than him—just one term. I have to admit that in that time I did not meet Dame Elisabeth. I am also confident that she never voted for me, so I stand here to acknowledge someone of views politically different to mine but whose absolute commitment to her community was extremely well known.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also grew up as a Frankston boy and lived in Karingal, not far down the road from Langwarrin and Cruden Farm. Even as a young man, I knew it was a famous place. The member for Dunkley mentioned the situation about the McClelland Gallery, which was just up the road from where I lived at that time, and it is also a great reminder of and a tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her commitment to the local area. As a local member, I often drove at that time and since past Cruden Farm and realised I was passing a place of special significance not only to the local community but also to Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you try to encapsulate a life such as this, it is basically all words and is hard to do it justice. Sometimes, to try to do that you fall flat—I certainly know that I will—but I would like to pick a few things that have been said by others, and some things that were said by Dame Elisabeth herself, that say so much about the nature of the lady—and she was a lady—and the nature of the mark that she left on the community of which she was part.
          </p>
          <p>
           One story that I found fascinating was that in the time after 1975 there was an active discussion at cabinet level about Dame Elisabeth possibly becoming Australia's Governor-General. I quote from an article:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Years later, when told of these cabinet discussions, Dame Elisabeth reacted indignantly. "I am astounded. How could anyone even suggest I should be governor-general of Australia?" she said, completely rejecting the widely held view that she would have been a splendid choice at such a crucial time in Australia's history. Dame Elisabeth's final say on the matter was: "I'm ashamed when they invite me to be included in
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Who" rel="nofollow">
             Who's Who
            </a>
           </i>
           and ask me to write down my academic degrees and qualifications and I can write down nothing except home duties. Never in a million years would I have said yes to any suggestion that I become governor-general."
          </p>
          <p>
           I stand here today and say I wish she had said yes, although I know that at the time the Governor-General who was appointed served in that role with great distinction, as have, frankly, those who have followed on since then. But it says much about the lady herself that her response was that she was not worthy. Yet she filled her life with so many worthy acts and so many worthy ideals. For example, and I quote:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           For 33 years she was a member of the committee of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Children's Hospital
           </a>
           in Melbourne—and president for the last 12 years before her retirement. The driving force behind the site and construction of the great new hospital in beautiful Royal Park, Dame Elisabeth even took on Victoria's legendary premier
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bolte" rel="nofollow">
            Henry Bolte
           </a>
           —and won—when he was urging a less favourable site. Then there were her years as trustee of Victoria's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
            National Gallery
           </a>
           , her support for the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and her hidden life as one of Australia's most generous philanthropists, helping people and organisations with millions of dollars distributed through the Elisabeth Murdoch Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Young artists and musicians were given the chance to study overseas because of her generosity, which also spread to support for talented prison artists serving long sentences.
          </p>
          <p>
           Dame Elisabeth was also a founder of Melbourne's Murdoch Children's Research Institute; the first woman appointed to the Council of Trustees of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
            National Gallery of Victoria
           </a>
           , as I mentioned; and President of the Royal Children's Hospital from 1954 to 1965. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of the Royal Children's Hospital, Christine Kilpatrick, said Dame Elisabeth was the driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Children's Hospital at the Royal Park site in the sixties and was a passionate supporter of the hospital's work. Murdoch Children's Research Institute Chairman, Leigh Clifford AO, said Dame Elisabeth's vision and commitment had saved thousands of children's lives and improved the health of many who are living with rare and common childhood conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Dunkley mentioned the McClelland Gallery.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lindsay" rel="nofollow">
            Robert Lindsay
           </a>
           , Director of the McClelland Gallery Sculpture Park in Langwarrin, said Dame Elisabeth was committed to the gallery for more than four decades. He said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           She had the vision, energy and passion for this gallery as well as helped with financial support.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           She was an incredible person, who led by example. If she decided something was important, she would go ahead and do it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Dame Elisabeth was patron of more than 100 charities and continuously supported local causes and individuals on the peninsula. Tim Harper, Principal of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Murdoch_College" rel="nofollow">
            Elisabeth Murdoch College
           </a>
           in Langwarrin, paid tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her incredible generosity of spirit:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I consider myself very fortunate to have had multiple opportunities to meet with Dame Elisabeth.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           She was always friendly and open and a tremendous person. Words can't describe how generous and community minded she was.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr Harper said he always felt inspired when walking away from a conversation with her.
          </p>
          <p>
           So we hear, from those comments, those involvements, those commitments and those ideals, that this was a lady who had much to be proud of, who was at the same time was self-effacing and modest but also a person of strongly held views. She was someone who could be very proud of what she achieved in her time on this earth. It was a long time, but she had a good time, and the things that she did will live on long after her passing. Her family should be proud, as are all Australians, of someone who lived her life in a way that was of great credit to herself and her family and also those around her.

             Dame Elisabeth Murdoch
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Dame Elisabeth lived a long and fruitful life. Her passing on 5 December 2012, aged 103, was marked by a chorus of admiration that came from all corners of society, community organisations that were beneficiaries of her philanthropy, business and political leaders who were in awe of her courage and constancy and of course her 77 living, direct descendants, including five great-great-grandchildren, that were touched by her love and affection. All came to know and respect this remarkable woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite being born to a different time, when Australia was a different place, Dame Elisabeth's values and purpose never lost their relevance and appeal. She would say, 'It is personal relationships that bring happiness, not money,' and, 'Always think of other people before yourself.' And help others she did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting more than 100 charities, in particular the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Children's Hospital
            </a>
            and the children's research institute that bears her family name, Dame Elisabeth gave much more than financial support to her chosen causes. She gave her time and her ideas, often helping to drive new projects and build broader support.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
             National Gallery

            of Victoria, a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria, a founding member of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, on the Patrons Council of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
             Epilepsy Foundation

            of Victoria—and the list goes on. So many organisations were beneficiaries of her involvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Acknowledging Dame Elisabeth's significant contribution to society, the Queen made Elisabeth a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Commander" rel="nofollow">

            of the

            in 1963. Dame Elisabeth was later awarded a

             Companion of the Order of Australia

            , in 1989, and in 2005 she was named
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
             Victorian of the Year

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            But it is often the case that great people who live great lives do not always have an easy run.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dame Elisabeth is no exception. After what was described as a fairy-tale romance, the marriage of Dame Elisabeth and Sir Keith came to an end after 24 years, following the untimely death of Sir Keith in 1952. Dame Elisabeth also experienced the tragic loss of her daughter Helen Handbury due to cancer in 2004.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Dame Elisabeth nevertheless continued on, hardly resting from her charitable efforts, and travelling down to Melbourne often, from the family property at Cruden Farm.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember countless charity functions where Dame Elisabeth would be welcomed as a special guest, only to find later during the auction that you could bid for an afternoon spent with friends having tea at Cruden Farm. I do not know how many times Dame Elisabeth hosted guests at Cruden Farm following a charitable auction, but I am sure there would be just too many to count.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a fascinating exchange in 2008,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
             Andrew Denton
            </a>
            interviewed Dame Elisabeth and asked her, if Keith was to return now, what he would think of her and what she has achieved in her life. 'Oh,' she said, 'I think he'd be very proud. I haven't wasted a minute. I've made use of all that time—and, I think, good use of it. That's what I hope one would think.' And so she has. A remarkable life. A remarkable lady.
           </p>
           <p>
            My condolences go to all of Dame Elisabeth's family—in particular her children Rupert, Anne and Janet, and Janet's husband

            , whom I have come know, and the Calvert-Joneses, who are good friends, I join with you at this sad time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australians can be proud that Dame Elisabeth was one of their own. There are few people in the world who can match her record of philanthropy and good deeds over such an extended period of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            May she rest in peace.

            <p>
             I rise today to speak about a great Australian:
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Elisabeth_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
              Dame Elisabeth Murdoch
             </a>
             . There are no words that can adequately portray the contribution Dame Elisabeth made to the community and Australia as a whole. She was an inspiration for thousands of people around this nation, and she was an inspiration to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had the very great pleasure of meeting Dame Elisabeth on a number of occasions. I enjoyed sitting next to her at dinner, which guaranteed a lively conversation. Dame Elisabeth was known not only for her sharp wit and curious mind, but for her ability to converse with people from all walks of life. On her conversational skills, she was once famously asked, 'What is the art to holding a conversation over a dinner table, to engage in someone?' She responded, 'Ask the man what he does. That's my opening. I am never stuck for a question. If you ask your next-door neighbour what he does it flows out. You can't stop him.' It is good advice, and having tested it I can say that it is accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
             One hundred and four years ago, Dame Elisabeth was born in Melbourne and educated at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Catherine's_School" rel="nofollow">
              St Catherine's School
             </a>
             , in my electorate of Higgins, followed by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_School" rel="nofollow">
              Clyde School
             </a>
             in Woodend. Dame Elisabeth had deep roots within the Melbourne community.
            </p>
            <p>
             At an early age Dame Elisabeth displayed a strong commitment to charity, for which she is so well-known. She volunteered for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Society
             </a>
             for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and, as a school girl, knitted a record number of baby garments for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Children's Hospital
             </a>
             Melbourne. This last activity earned her a tour of the hospital, which confirmed to her that her life would be one of service.
            </p>
            <p>
             This passion for helping others drove her life's work. But it was not her only passion. At the age of 19 she was courted by, and then married, one of Australia's leading publishers, Sir
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
              Keith Murdoch
             </a>
             . They had four children: Rupert, Janet, Anne and Helen. In 1952 Dame Elisabeth assumed the role of matriarch, when her husband passed away from cancer at the age of 67.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dame Elisabeth served as President of the Royal Children's Hospital Management Committee from 1954 to 1965 where she was the driving force behind fundraising events and donations. She was recognised for her work in 1963 when she was appointed
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Commander" rel="nofollow">
              Dame Commander

              British Empire
             </a>
             . This association with the Royal Children's Hospital is one, of course, that is a close connection and one that so many Australians and particularly Victorians really, really admire her for and have received much benefit from. I have a very good friend who is currently receiving excellent care with her newborn baby at the Royal Children's Hospital. It is a very stressful time and I know that without the great care and skill of the people at the Royal Children's Hospital it would be a very, very traumatic time for her. So we admire Dame Elisabeth for the great work that she did there.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1968 Dame Elisabeth became the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
              National Gallery
             </a>
             of Victoria. She held the position for eight years. In the same year she was awarded an honorary
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate_of_Laws" rel="nofollow">
              Doctorate of Laws
             </a>
             by the University of Melbourne in acknowledgement of her contributions to research, the arts and philanthropy.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College" rel="nofollow">
              Trinity College

            </p>
            <p>
             In 1976 she co-founded the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and served as its chairman from 1986 to 1988. In 1984 she helped found the Murdoch Institute known today as the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, another very well-known and well-regarded institute. She was an honorary Fellow of the Australian Institute of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_Architecture" rel="nofollow">
              Landscape Architecture
             </a>
             and she funded the Elisabeth Murdoch Chair of Landscape Architecture and the

              Australian Garden History Society
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             In an interview later in her life, she was asked why she dedicated her life's work to helping others. Her response was 'as a sort of thanksgiving'. Humble to the very end, Dame Elisabeth understood and respected the life that she was handed and, in turn, gave back to those less fortunate. Graceful and elegant, Dame Elisabeth was someone we could all look up to as an example of the human spirit at its most gracious and compassionate. Dame Elisabeth leaves a wonderful legacy. While she may have 77 direct descendants, her life has enriched millions more, and we thank her for that.

             </p>
             <p>
              At 18 years of age, Dame Elisabeth met the influential journalist and media proprietor

              </i>
              magazine. Keith was 42 and their age difference set society tongues wagging. But they were married in a matter of months. They went on to have four children. Even though she was widowed only 23 years later, Dame Elisabeth always identified her loving marriage as the foundation of her long life. 'Happiness gives great strength,' she said.
             </p>
             <p>
              A simple and practical woman, Dame Elisabeth believed that we lived in a materialistic age. Dame Elisabeth spoke of her family fortune and of philanthropy with the ABC's
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" rel="nofollow">
               Andrew Denton
              </a>
              . He asked her:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Is philanthropy about more than simply giving money?
             </p>
             <p>
              She replied:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Oh you must be involved. I think if you've got money it's perfectly easy to give it away and nothing to be particularly proud of but it's being involved and knowing what you're helping. And you know, really being committed to whatever things you're helping.
             </p>
             <p>
              Apart from raising her children, Dame Elisabeth devoted her life to philanthropy, supporting more than 100 different charities. She was devoted to the arts, to gardens and the landscape, to education and medicine, to the disabled and to the underprivileged. Her name is perpetuated at places like the

              Dame Elisabeth was keen to share her fortune. My sister Kate, who knew Dame Elisabeth, told me how she was very proud to give her support to less popular causes like children in care and those battling mental illness and substance abuse. Dame Elisabeth was also involved in an organisation to rehabilitate prisoners back into society. When asked in the interview with the ABC's Andrew Denton why she chose to support an organisation for prisoners, Dame Elisabeth said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              … you can help them to rehabilitate.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              …   …   …
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I find that the people who run them are so good. They're so selfless and so good giving their voluntary time. The world is full of good people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dame Elisabeth passed away at her home in Langwarrin in December 2012. She was 103 years old. On behalf of the people of the Ryan electorate, I pass on my condolences to Dame Elisabeth's family.

              <p>
               I had the enormous pleasure of knowing
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Elisabeth_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
                Dame Elisabeth Murdoch
               </a>
               . She lived just outside my own electorate. Very early on in my time in parliament, my then fiancee, Paula, and I were invited to Cruden Farm to meet with Dame Elisabeth—I think she was sort of kicking the tyres of the newest member in the area. We had a long discussion about life and about community, family and responsibility, and then she decided to take Paula and me on a drive through Cruden Farm gardens. She had been given a little four-wheel drive beach buggy by her family. She took off on this beach buggy, at what I think was then about age 93, and roared around her gardens at speeds which were probably illegal and certainly undesirable, and she was roaring with laughter the entire way. For me, it was an experience in speed at the fastest of levels, but for us there was a sense of a grandmotherly, by then great-grandmotherly, figure who loved life, had a great appreciation for community and family—we had spent the vast bulk of our time talking about the local community and its priorities—and was not afraid to live every day as if it mattered and to simply express the joy of her life. I think that was a fantastic thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a later occasion—by then I had met Dame Elisabeth and spent quite a bit of time with her on different fronts—I arrived at a charity dinner for the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Children's Hospital
               </a>
               , to discover that I was seated next to Dame Elisabeth for the evening. There were about 600 people there and I sat down and said, 'Hello, Dame Elisabeth.' She said, 'Hello,' and I said, 'I think I'm your date for the evening.' She looked at me and said, 'Could do worse; could do better.' She was a very relaxed soul throughout all her later years. Of course, I did not know the earlier incarnation, but I know many people who did know the earlier incarnation of Dame Elisabeth and they said, 'Take the 93-, the 95- or the 99-year-old and imagine what she was like in her 40s, 50s and 60s'—this phenomenal ball of goodwill and energy.
              </p>

               </a>
               and in the Frankston area, she was simply the most adored citizen we had. There is no question about it. She was always seen as open and accessible. As the patron of more than 100 charities, many of which were local, she was a great supporter. I dealt recently with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a group set up by
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stubbs" rel="nofollow">
                Richard Stubbs
               </a>
               and supported by people such as Tom McGann for those who have significant disabilities which cause almost complete immobility. Beyond Disability provides computers and computing software and training so that people—maybe with their teeth, maybe with voice command or in other ways—can manipulate and work on the internet and engage in computing activity.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dame Elisabeth was of course a very strong supporter of this local peninsular charity, Beyond Disability. They were amazed at their access and the way in which they could engage with somebody who was engaged with the great global issues but who was also intensely aware of the community in her backyard. I know many community groups that have held events at Cruden Farm, were personally hosted by Dame Elisabeth and were amazed at the way in which she would make time and engage with them—in the sense not of polite tolerance but of deep personal interest in what they had to say and what their needs were. I recognise that Dame Elisabeth came from the most famous of families, but this was somebody who ignored all of that and was completely engaged in the local community. She did not care what somebody's station was in life; she just cared whether they were sincere, whether they had a need and whether she could assist.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am delighted to acknowledge the life that was Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. I am delighted to have had a really wonderful set of encounters with her as a great resident of the top of the Mornington Peninsula. I thank her for her life and I pass on my best to her family—but I know that, whilst there is lots of sadness, they celebrate one of the great Australian stories.

               <p>
                I wish to join with the chamber in remembering the long and full life of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Elisabeth_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
                 Dame Elisabeth Murdoch
                </a>
                and to convey not only my condolences but those of my family to her family—in particular my mother, because the mutual interests of both mum and Dame Elisabeth brought them into regular contact over the years.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dame Elisabeth has set a personal challenge for all of us in this chamber and in the broader community. She took her position—granted, it was a fortunate one, but she used her considerable skills and resources to make a difference by contributing to the life and wellbeing of her community. She did so with grace, humility and an enduring curiosity about the interesting people who made up that community.
               </p>
               <p>
                It would take too long to recite all of the contributions that Dame Elisabeth made to our community over the 104 years of her life. But I will mention a number, to demonstrate the diversity of her interests: to health, medical research and academia as Life Governor of the

                of Victoria; and to adults and children with disabilities, as patron and founding member of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EW" rel="nofollow">
                 EW
                </a>
                Tipping Foundation and as a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria. To international relations and business: she was patron of the Australian-American Association Victoria, which was founded by her late husband. To heritage, and flora and fauna: Cruden Farm at Langwarrin is one of Australia's finest examples of landscape gardening. She also devoted herself to less popular causes such as prisoners, children in care, those battling mental illness and substance abuse.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will come to her investment in arts organisations and artistic talent a little bit later, but Dame Elisabeth set the benchmark for how we can contribute to our community—whatever our financial and personal circumstances. Her passion and her commitment told us that volunteering and donating is not something you put off to next year or to better times; it is something that you do now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dame Elisabeth also made it abundantly clear to all that contributing her money and time and energy to a cause brought a rich return to her personally, as well as to the community—she in fact showed philanthropy could be fun. Each of us here can follow her path and learn the rewards of service.
               </p>
               <p>
                So it is fitting that we honour her with this condolence motion. A few weeks back the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Recital_Centre" rel="nofollow">
                 Melbourne Recital Centre
                </a>
                had more than 1,000 people come to the Elisabeth Murdoch Hall for its celebration of Dame Elisabeth's life. The deep interest and enjoyment of the arts, particularly music, led to her involvement in building some of our best arts companies. She supported the careers of many of our most talented performers and artists. She touched so many lives in the arts that it is no surprise the evening saw a full house.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is also fitting that we remember her in that last week, because it was then that we announced the name of Australia's new agency for philanthropy, social investment and business partnership in the cultural sector. That agency, Creative Partnerships Australia, is charged with building a culture of giving in Australia, something that Dame Elisabeth taught us so much about. In a way, through that organisation we will be building on her example and helping more and more Australians make a personal contribution to their community.
               </p>
               <p>
                Coming from Melbourne, Dame Elisabeth was an integral part of Victoria, and Victorians all knew her work well. My mother in particular enjoyed the opportunity to interact with her when she was a member of the women's association, raising money for acquisitions at the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
                 National Gallery
                </a>
                of Victoria. It was again another of those mutual interests that brought them together.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dame Elisabeth's longevity meant that she was able to see the impact of her philanthropy and her involvement. She could see what she was contributing to, and so many of the end results. More than most of us she knew that investing in the arts brings with it a significant dividend.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dame Elisabeth received numerous honours throughout her life, including being made a

                </a>
                , of which she was the first female trustee. Dame Elisabeth was chair of the committee that established the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and a trustee and supporter of the establishment of the regional McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, along with many other arts groups and individuals.
               </p>
               <p>
                She leaves a magnificent legacy, and it is incumbent upon all of us not only to respect her and pay condolences in her passing but, in respect for her, to continue to build upon so much of what she laid foundations for. I extend my sympathies to the Murdoch family. We will miss her but we will not miss her example. It is incumbent upon us to remember to build upon that example.
