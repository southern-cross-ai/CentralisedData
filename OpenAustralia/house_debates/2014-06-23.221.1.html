        and his lovely wife Lyn, both of whom were born and bred in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        town of Mackay. After almost 40 years and having had his first album produced by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kristofferson" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Kristofferson
        </a>
        , Graeme Connors has produced 18 albums and received 14 Golden Guitars and an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA" rel="nofollow">
         ARIA
        </a>
        award, as well as numerous other singing and song-writing awards. Graeme's first major hit came 25 years ago with the song
        <i>
         A little further north
        </i>
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        which was inspired by feelings of homesickness when he was living in Sydney. Songs on the
        <i>
         North
        </i>
        album are powerful insights into his home town, Mackay, and the North Queensland lifestyle. The album certainly found broad appeal across Australia but there is a special connection for local in songs like
        <i>
         Let
        </i>
        <i>
         the cane fields burn, Mango shade
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Cyclone season.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
        <i>
         North
        </i>
        album, which was voted the No. 3 best Australian country album of all time, Graeme Connors will be performing the album in its entirety at a special concert at the Mackay Entertainment and Convention Centre in Mackay on 11 July. He is also performing it elsewhere across North Queensland. Graeme has always been a great ambassador for the city of Mackay and for North Queensland through his music. I am sure his songs have inspired many cold southerners to 'head a little further north each year' themselves.
