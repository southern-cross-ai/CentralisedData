        One of the aspects of my electorate that I love the most is its diversity. Werriwa is home to almost every language, religion and culture on earth. One of the greatest pleasures of my role is supporting these communities and cultures in their celebrations. I recently attended one such celebration: the gala dinner to mark the 35th Serbian Folkloric Festival. The festival, which began in 1987, is a two-day celebration of Serbian culture. It brings together all generations celebrating the dance, song and food of Serbia. Also in attendance was His Excellency Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Serbia to the Commonwealth of Australia Mr. Rade Stefanovic. I commend the organisers of the night. The event was a tremendous occasion, and I look forward to celebrating the contribution that the Serbian community makes not only in Werriwa but in the wider Australian community.

        of Liverpool and District Historical Society held the Ward and Olive Havard Memorial Lecture recently. The society is one of our local community's most important organisations. It is dedicated to the preservation of the history of Liverpool and its surrounds. Unfortunately, as with many areas, so much of our history has been lost or forgotten in the name of progress. The commitment of the hardworking volunteers ensures our history is acknowledged, celebrated and conserved. I acknowledge the leadership of the secretary, Gail Newman, and the president, Glen Op Den Brouw.

        The lecture was delivered by Mrs June Young

        , who has been the face of Liverpool's charitable and civic events for longer than I remember. Her hard work, dedication and drive to help those in need, charities and others is legendary. I have watched firsthand the positive impact she has on our local community. June has been a resident of the Liverpool area for over 50 years. Her service is far-reaching, both within and outside our community. June has had extensive involvement in Quota International and Rotary, two organisations that have been driven by a shared goal of eliminating poverty and helping those in need. Closer to home, Mrs Young is involved in the Sheppard Centre, Miracle Babies, the Cancer Council, the Autistic Advisory Committee,

        . And this list is by no means exhaustive. Her involvement in so many organisations over the years stems from a single motivation. Thank you, June, for all you have done for our community.
