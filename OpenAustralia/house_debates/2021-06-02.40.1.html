        It's with a heavy heart that today I pay tribute to Joyce Fitzgerald of Taree, who passed away last week aged 94 years. Joyce joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Country Party
        </a>
        back in 1949, when her husband, Jack, did. He was the secretary of the branch then. A staunch member and supporter, Joyce never missed a meeting, was a member of the ladies committee and went on to serve as secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Manning Valley
        </a>
        branch for over 30 years. Joyce was a lady from an era gone by, always immaculately dressed. Even in her later years she had an energy and love for life that was infectious to everyone around her. Joyce's contribution to the Manning Valley stretched far beyond the Country Party. She was a past president of the

        , which when Joyce led it initiated recognition and reward for improved customer service. She was also coordinator for the Taree Aquatic Carnival festival queen and Taree show society candidates. She held the role of secretary for the Manning All Breeds Association,

        quarter horse and the Manning Valley cattlemen's union and was founding secretary of Wingham Beef Week. Joyce had been a dairy farmer and in her heart she always was. She was a fierce advocate for the industry and for farmers. I pass my condolences on to Geraldine and Alston and their family. Vale, Joyce Fitzgerald.
