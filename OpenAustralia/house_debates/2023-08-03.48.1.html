        On nearly a hundred occasions, Labor said to the Australian public that they would deliver a $275 reduction off their power bill. Today, they blame the war on Ukraine. However, the war in Ukraine had already commenced when they made their repeated promises. You just can't trust Labor. In fact, as of today, Australian families are paying some of the highest power prices in the world, and they'll only get higher as this government stumbles over its mismanagement and its energy price policy.

        The families I represent in Wright will always pay more under Labor. Remember when Labor promised that Australian families would be better off under a

        ? Yet we've seen on their watch 12 interest rate rises that are crippling Australian families—a monumental failure of economic leadership. Mortgage holders are paying, on average, $1,200 extra per month—that's $14,400 per year—and there are many more families about to fall off the Labor interest rate cliff as they come off fixed interest rates. It's further evidence that you can't trust Labor and you'll always pay more under Labor. Remember the embarrassment and the monumental policy failure of Labor's mining tax that never raised a cent? Labor went on a spending spree, spending funds that never came in. That debt still sits on our books today.

        Under this government, you'll pay more for your electricity and you'll pay more for your mortgages. You'll always pay more under a Labor government.
