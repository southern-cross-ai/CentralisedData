        The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is proposing to undertake infrastructure works to manage the risks of stormwater flooding, landslide and rockfall at key locations on Christmas Island.

       </p>
       <p>
        These proposed works are necessary to protect the community and visitors living or working on Christmas Island and to ensure the government meets its obligations to provide safe workplaces. The estimated cost of the works is $28.9 million excluding

        —Parramatta office fit-out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Home Affairs is proposing fit-out works as part of its consolidation of leased office space in Sydney. Home Affairs currently occupies three buildings in Sydney—two in the Sydney central business district and one in Parramatta. The leases are due to expire in 2022 and 2023, with no options to extend. Under the Home Affairs Sydney precinct strategy, the consolidation of these three sites into a single site in Parramatta will provide operational efficiency and flexibility to allow the change in future business requirements and will reduce overall property operating costs. The estimated costs of the works is $25.2 million. The works must be referred to, considered by and reported on to both houses of the parliament by the Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in November 2021 and scheduled to be completed in mid-2022. I commend the motion to the House.
