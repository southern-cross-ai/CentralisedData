        Yesterday, thousands of people attended a funeral service held to farewell Kris Guglielmucci. Kris was a youth pastor associated with the Victory Church at Pooraka and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Edge Church
        </a>
        at Reynella. He was at a youth camp in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Hills
        </a>
        with about 100 young people and about 20 other church leaders when a freak storm event arose and he was struck by lightning. As the storm became more intense, Kris's concern was for the safety of the young people rather than for his own safety, attempting to ensure that they were all out of harm's way. The service drew people from around the worldâ€”testament to the regard with which Kris was held by those who knew him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Sunday, hundreds of people packed the Victory Church to hear a service, led by pastors Tony and Kath Rainbow, that was dedicated to Kris. It was one of several services devoted to him held since the tragedy. As a youth pastor and a member of the worldwide youth movement Planetshakers, Kris touched the lives of so many people. He will be widely missed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kris leaves behind his wife, Lisa, and their four young children. For them, the loss is the greatest. I know that they have been helped immensely by their church colleagues. My condolences go to Lisa and the children, to his parents, Danny and Sharonne, to his family, to all of his colleagues and friends at Victory and Edge churches, and to all those who knew him. May he rest in peace.
