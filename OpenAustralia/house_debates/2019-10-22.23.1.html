        After 12 years as principal of

         St Andrew's
        </a>
        College and a career in education spanning over 40 years, Nicholas Vidot has recently retired and I want to recognise him today. When he became the principal of St Andrew's in 2007, the college was made up of two separate campuses:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Family" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Family
        </a>
        and John Paul
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . During his time as principal, he wove together the processes and cultures of these distinct campuses, combining them into one community. Nic's mantra, 'People are important; people do matter', led St Andrew's to adopt an approach to make learning self-directed and personalised for each student.

        assistant principal Shauna Nash said, 'Thank you, Nic, for the leadership, the vision and the precision you brought to St Andrew's college.' This quote encapsulates the gratitude of the school and community towards Nic and my appreciation of him also. I want to acknowledge the presence of Nic and his wife, Elizabeth, who are joining us here today in the public gallery. Thank you, Nic, not only for your dedication but also your belief in the potential of

        students. I wish you all the very best in your retirement. Please enjoy it and know that our gratitude and our deepest thanks go with you.
