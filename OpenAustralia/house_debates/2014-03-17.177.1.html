       <p>
        I rise today to mention Mr Vissa Esan, who was tragically stabbed to death in what appears to be a random act of senseless violence outside his real estate business in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendle_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in my electorate of Greenway last Thursday. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Esan on several occasions. He ran a successful business in the Greenway electorate and he was a much-loved member of the local Tamil community and the community at large. Mr Esan's wife, Shanika, is expecting their first child, and tragically that child will never know their father.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Esan was known as a friendly and generous man who helped anyone in need and always found ways to offer his assistance. Mr Esan was born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and came to Australia 20 years ago. Since that time, he has helped new arrivals find accommodation and given them guidance in their new country. He was also well known for assisting his country of birth as it rebuilds after civil war, demonstrating his great generosity of spirit and his advocacy for peace and reconciliation. As reported by

        </a>
        on 14 March, one of his colleagues said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was a really popular guy and community leader. He was very kind-hearted and helped all his fellow Tamil people. We all loved him, he was a great guy
       </p>
       <p>
        On the eve of Mr Esan's funeral, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. By all accounts he was a generous and kind man who served his community and provided for his family. Finally, my heart goes out to his wife, Shanika. I cannot begin to imagine what she is going through at this time and on what will be such a sad day tomorrow.
