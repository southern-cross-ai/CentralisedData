        I formally recognise the important contribution made to our local economy by the vocational education and training sector within the Joondalup Learning Precinct and advocate for continued strong federal government support. Led by visionary managing director Michelle Hoad, the West Coast Institute is a leading organisation in Moore which delivers education and training to more than 8,800 students, based at four locations, providing the necessary skills training to boost employability and increase workforce productivity. Supported by a staff of more than 350 experienced academic and industry specialists, West Coast Institute delivers more than 120 internationally recognised vocational education and training programs, ranging from short skill-set courses through to nationally accredited programs ranging from certificates to associate degrees and also apprenticeships and traineeships.
