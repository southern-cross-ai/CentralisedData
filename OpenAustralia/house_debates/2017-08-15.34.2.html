        My question is to the Prime Minister. It goes to the eligibility of members of cabinet to hold office. The Deputy Prime Minister told ABC Radio:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unfortunately that's the law … They were members of parliament, but it's quite clear on Section 44 you can't be a member of parliament and have dual citizenship—it's black and white.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why isn't the Prime Minister holding his deputy to his own standards?

             The High Court
            </a>
            has made it very clear in a number of cases that section 44 cannot be read literally and has to be read in accordance with its purpose and its intent, and there are limitations to its scope. There are a number of members on the Labor side—I can think of at least one who was a British citizen at the time she nominated for the last election. There's no question about that. To give the member for Braddon credit, her defence is that she had taken all reasonable steps to renounce her citizenship, but it had not been effective. If there were a strictly literal reading of section 44, she would be disqualified, because she certainly knew she was a British subject. So the point of the matter is: what the Deputy Prime Minister said in that interview was not a correct interpretation or description of the way the law operates. That's the fact.

            You can laugh as much as you like. But the constitution is interpreted by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             High Court of Australia
            </a>
            , and, as I've said, we are very, very confident that, when the matter of the eligibility of the member for New England comes before the High Court, he will be found to be qualified to sit in this parliament. That is consistent with the findings of the court.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the real issue today—and I look forward to saying some more about it in the course of this question time—does go to an issue of allegiance and loyalty. No-one has ever doubted the loyalty of the Deputy Prime Minister to Australia, but what about the Leader of the Opposition conspiring with the

            of New Zealand to undermine the government of Australia? He chose—in a way denounced by the Leader of the

                 in return for the payment of his legal expenses by a company called Yuhu Group led by Mr Xiangmo Huang, who had close links to China's Communist Party. That was cash for comment—no question about that whatsoever. Senator Dastyari was, for a very short time, dropped from the Labor executive as a result. In the last week we have seen the

                   . She has condemned it. The question that we have for the Leader of the Opposition in Australia is: does he have the same character as Jacinda Ardern? Is he prepared to name the person who went to New Zealand to get them to ask those questions? Is he prepared to condemn that use of a foreign political party and a foreign parliament to undermine the government of Australia? He could have—very simply, straightforwardly and honestly—asked the Deputy Prime Minister a question. He could have asked him a question. Why didn't he do that? I will tell you why.

                         they would have then had to provide details of their own eligibility and their own compliance with section 44. We have had assurances that everyone on the Labor side is in compliance, but we have had no evidence. We've had that great barrister, the member for Isaacs, say he is satisfied they are all in compliance. But where are the documents? Let's see them.

And it is a principle of international law that nations do not seek to interfere in the domestic political processes of other countries. This morning there was an extraordinary development when it was revealed that the Leader of the Opposition had plumbed new depths in his underhanded behaviour when it was found that the

                                to ask questions in the New Zealand parliament that were deliberately designed to undermine confidence in the Australian parliament.

There are so many members of the Labor party whose status is uncertain—

                                  yet he didn't raise it with the Prime Minister and he didn't raise it in our parliament, in our question time. I quote from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand, the former defence minister of New Zealand, who said a short time ago:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  It's extraordinary that a New Zealand member of Parliament has allowed himself to be used by a party in a different country with an intent to bring another party in that country down.
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  It's quite extraordinary. I just don't think we've seen anything like this before.
