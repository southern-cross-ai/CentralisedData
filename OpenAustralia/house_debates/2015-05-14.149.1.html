        I rise to speak about our government's budget, a budget which is all about jobs, growth and opportunity. It is a budget which is responsible, measured and fair. That is why our budget is funding a number of job creation programs. In the electorate of Corangamite I represent, our No. 1 priority is jobs—the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, which has so far created 750 jobs; and the Growth Fund, to deliver new jobs, particularly in manufacturing. There is another $1.3 million for Geelong Employment Connections, which is delivering our jobs fair and providing grassroots support to manufacturing and retrenched workers with the help of a dedicated employment facilitator. There is more than $7 million for the $40 million Northern Community Hub in Norlane, which will deliver 100 jobs under our National Stronger Regions Fund. Another funding round is about to open, and many more opportunities will flow from that. There is $1.5 billion to build a proper western link for Geelong commuters. State Labor's proposal simply does not deliver for the people of Corangamite.

        Last week, I was very proud to turn the sod on the $371 million duplication of the

        between Colac and Winchelsea, with half of the funding coming from our government. We are also upgrading the

        , which is so important for tourism, jobs and road safety. Other big projects being delivered in our region are the National Disability Insurance Scheme trial, the ABS Centre of Excellence and of course the rollout of the

        There is some fantastic news for small business out of our budget. For the 11,300 small businesses across my electorate—this is fantastic news for jobs and growth—there is $5.5 billion to deliver a 1.5 per cent cut to the company tax rate to 28.5 per cent, the lowest in almost 50 years, and for sole traders and unincorporated businesses, a five per cent tax discount up to $1000 a year. Small businesses can also claim an immediate tax deduction for each and every asset purchased up to $20,000 and they can do that right now and claim the tax deduction straightaway. This is an extremely important measure for small business and for jobs.

        For families, child care will be simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible. Families earning between 65,000 and 170,000 will receive an extra $1500 a year in child care from the government, and the new childcare safety net will provide more support for disadvantaged and vulnerable children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor left us with a terrible legacy of debt and deficit which we are tackling, while fighting for jobs, growth and opportunity.
