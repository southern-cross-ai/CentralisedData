       <p>
        There were two tragedies in Queensland in this last week: a woman, Hannah, and her children murdered in the suburbs of Brisbane in horrific circumstances; and another woman stabbed to death, in a case the police are saying was yet another case of domestic violence. I want to extend my sincere sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of those lost, and to the first responders.
       </p>
       <p>
        This type of violence is pervasive. We need to stop it. On average, more than one woman a week is murdered by a current or former partner. We all need to do more. The figures on the murders are truly horrific, but they don't count all the othersâ€”those who are injured, disfigured, maimed; those who have suffered psychological abuse, financial abuse, controlling behaviour; the children exposed to trauma, and the impact it has on them for the rest of their lives. This violence is about power and control. These murders don't exist in a vacuum. Sadly, it appears to have been the case in these recent situations that some people's attitudes to women and their roles in the community are still an issue. Gender inequality is still an issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor want to see more action. We're calling for a national summit. We want to make sure that every single person is doing everything that we can and should do to make it stop now. I want to reiterate to anybody who is experiencing family violence to call 1800RESPECT.
