        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Ten Network has reported that government staffers allegedly brought sex workers to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        for a current government MP. What steps has the Prime Minister taken to investigate these very serious allegations concerning a current member of the government, which constitute a blackmail risk and potentially jeopardise national security?

        <p>
         The matter the member has raised in his question is a very serious matter. I can add little to what I said to him yesterday. The process that we were following yesterday was to make contact with the whistleblower on this issue and encourage them to bring that information forward that would allow us to take that matter further. I am advised that, after that contact has been made, the whistleblower at this point is not in a position to do that. And that makes this issue very difficult to pursue. The individual who has alleged these matters—we're not in a position to know the veracity or truth of that one way or another. So I would only encourage that individual, if they—or anyone—have information on that, to bring it forward so that it can be properly addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to other matters that were raised in these reports: we will take the opportunity at the appropriate time—the individual has already left the employment of the government as a staff member and is currently under care—to have a conversation with that individual. We'll take that opportunity when it presents.
