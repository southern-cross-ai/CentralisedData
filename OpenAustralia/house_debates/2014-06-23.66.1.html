        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. I refer to the list of liable entities, released by the Clean Energy Regulator on Friday, 20 June, which shows that Qantas, Virgin and Rex will face a carbon tax bill of $171 million in 2013-14. What is the government doing to remove the carbon tax, and how will air travellers benefit from its removal?

         I thank the honourable member for Parkes for the question. He has every right to be concerned about the impact of carbon tax on Australian airlines. It adds to the cost of aircraft flying around the countryside. It makes it more difficult for people to go about their business. It makes it more difficult for country people, in particular, to go to the city when they need medical treatment or to attend to day-to-day activities. The impact of the carbon tax on these costs is having a major impact on the airlines themselves. We have heard members opposite talking about wanting to look after Qantas and Virgin and wanting to make sure that we have strong airlines in Australia. But how do they go about it? By imposing upon them a tax that airlines in other parts of the world do not pay. By imposing on them a penalty which makes it more difficult for them to get about their business. It makes it more difficult for them to trade profitably and to employ Australians.

           This is Labor's response. This is Labor's way to help aviation in this country. It adds to their direct costs through fuel, and, of course, it also adds to their indirect costs. It makes it more expensive for many businesses to operate and, therefore, they fly less. All of that is bad news for the aviation sector. This financial year, the report shows that Qantas has already had to pay $114 million in carbon tax, whilst Virgin has paid $54.5 million and Rex has paid $2.3 million. This is at a time when the airlines are losing money and reporting negative balance sheets. They are talking about running at a loss and having to lay people off. Labor says it wants to help. Well, vote to get rid of the carbon tax! Get rid of the carbon tax and give our airlines a fair go. Give them an opportunity to trade profitably again and to provide services to the Australian people. There is a simple way for Labor to help the airlines. Take the advice of John Borghetti, who said that the best thing the government could do to make a difference to the airline industry was to remove the carbon tax. Here is your chance. Get on with it. Vote to get rid of the carbon tax.
