        My question is to the Attorney-General. Why is it important the National Anti-Corruption Commission be established as soon as possible?

         I thank the member for Morton for his question. At the last election the Australian people delivered a clear message. They want a national anticorruption commission to be established without delay. Australians were fed up with delays and broken promises made by those on the other side, and they wanted action. This fortnight we plan to deliver on our pledge to legislate a National Anti-Corruption Commission this year. The former government said they would establish an anticorruption commission in December 2018. But they never did. Tomorrow this House will continue to debate on the two bills which, if passed through both houses, will establish a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission will have the powers of a standing royal commission and will be tasked with both investigating and preventing corruption at the federal level. It will have sufficient safeguards to protect against undue reputational damage and will operate according to the principles of procedural fairness. The bills that will be debated in this House this week are the outcome of months of work and extensive consultation. The bills have been examined by three committee inquiries, including a joint select committee inquiry that delivered a unanimous report.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an opportunity for this House to come together. Respect the mandate given by the Australian people and support these bills. We are not afraid of constructive criticism and dialogue. In fact, we have encouraged it throughout the process that led us to this point. There will be significant debate as these bills pass through the House and the Senate, as there should be. But through that debate we should not lose sight of the task that has been given to us by the Australian people, to deliver a National Anti-Corruption Commission with teeth and without delay. This government stands ready to deliver and I call on all sides of the Parliament to join us in that task.
