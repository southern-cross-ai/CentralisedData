        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House how the government will meet Australia's international commitment on carbon emissions while also guaranteeing reliable and affordable energy for all hardworking Australians?

         I thank the member for Bowman for his question and for his deep interest in ensuring that the Australian people are provided with affordable and reliable electricity. That is indeed the priority of the Turnbull government not only for Australian households but also for Australian businesses so that they can be internationally competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Energy Guarantee has been welcomed by those who are responsible for the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians. In particular, I refer to the comments of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of Master Grocers, who said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Turnbull Government has … proposed a plan that promises businesses 'cheaper and more reliable electricity.'
        </p>
        <p>
         The CEO of the Australian Food and Grocery Council says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The National Energy Guarantee's focus on delivering affordable and reliable power is a fundamental step forward in providing long term policy certainty for Australia's largest manufacturing sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
          JBS
         </a>
         Australia said: 'JBS Australia, as Australia's meat and food processor and a major energy user, welcomes the announcement of the government's National Energy Guarantee that, as a policy, offers a solution to lower the costs of energy, deliver reliability and underpin a competitive Australian manufacturing sector. We employ 12,000 people across five Australian states.' Energy Consumers Australia said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Energy Consumers Australia CEO … welcomed the plan … endorsed by the Federal Government, which integrates the need for reliable power and emissions reductions in the electricity sector, at least cost for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then the CEO of the Business Council of Australia said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The government's plan … is the most practical, workable thing we've seen in business for quite some time … it brings together the three crucial things together: affordability, reliability and meeting our carbon target.
        </p>
        <p>
         And that is absolutely correct. This is the first time we've seen climate policy and energy policy integrated to give affordable and reliable power as well as meet our international obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compare and contrast Labor's unaffordable, unreliable, irresponsible policies. A 45 per cent emissions reduction target is way beyond any other target by any comparable economy, whether it is Japan,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         , Canada or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         . And the 50 per cent renewable energy target that the Labor opposition would embrace in government would drive up power prices, drive down jobs growth and put our international competitiveness at risk. The $66 billion subsidy that the Labor opposition want to impose on Australian businesses and households would be passed on to consumers again, driving up power prices, driving down jobs growth and putting our international competitiveness at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice is clear. The Labor Party stands for higher power prices. The coalition stands for affordable and reliable energy that meets our international obligation.
