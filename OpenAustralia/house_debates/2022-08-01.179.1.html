        St Paul's Anglican Church is a beautiful sandstone church in Burwood. Go there on any given day, at any given hour, and it will be a hive of activity. That is because of the incredible work of Father James Collins and his team of committed volunteers. The main buzz of activity comes from the parish pantry, started in 2012. It's been a constant source of much-needed food and essential items for locals doing it tough. What is extraordinary about the pantry is that it remained open throughout the pandemic to make sure that people were able to get the help that they needed.

        . They have defied the odds by providing all this assistance on a shoestring budget. But in the last 2Â½ years of the pandemic, they've seen an unprecedented spike in demand. Where they previously provided a few hundred meals a week, they are now providing 4,000 meals a week. I thank them for their tireless work helping out the most vulnerable in the community.
