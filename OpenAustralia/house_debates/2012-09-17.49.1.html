        Over the weekend we saw some violent protests in the streets of cities of Australia. I think all Australians would be sickened by the behaviour we saw over the weekend. I think we all condemn this behaviour in the strongest possible terms, particularly the use of children to carry offensive placards. I think the parliament is at one in condemning this behaviour. I know that Muslim leaders have condemned this behaviour as well. We want to see no part in Australian society for this sort of behaviour into the future.

         Australians would have been shocked at the scenes of violence and intolerance on the streets of Sydney on Saturday. There is no place in Australia for such behaviour, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Ours is a nation that for decades has welcomed millions of people from diverse ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds. Australia is often regarded as one of the most successful multicultural societies on Earth, where people from every corner of the planet live peacefully, side by side. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, newcomers to this country are not expected to surrender their heritage, but they are expected to surrender their hatreds.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have fostered a society based on pillars of respect and tolerance for the diversity within our society. It is underpinned by the rule of law, whereby all Australians are equally subject to the laws of our land, regardless of their background. We strongly support the right of individuals and groups to stage peaceful protests about issues they hold dear. There is no excuse for resorting to violence, particularly against the police, who are doing their duty of ensuring the safety of others and protecting property.

         The riot on Saturday was purportedly sparked by an amateur video that insulted the prophet Mohammed, and that is being promoted around the world by extremists. It was given as the reason for the murderous rampage against the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Embassy" rel="nofollow">
          United States Embassy
         </a>
         in Libya, where four American officials were killed, including the ambassador. The video was not produced by the United States government, and nor was it endorsed by the United States government. This video was in fact strongly condemned by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         officials. The rioters had no reason whatsoever for seeking to violently target the offices of the US consulate in Sydney. Our fear is that extremist elements in Australia and in other countries are using this
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">

         video to incite hatred and incite violence in pursuit of long-held goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         We acknowledge the condemnation of this riot by Muslim community leaders, who have expressed outrage and horror at the scenes of violence. We stand with the brave officers of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales Police Force
         </a>
         , who were subject to injury and violent attack. We are united with all Australians in condemnation of the actions of the few who took part in that violence, of those who incited it and of any person who seeks to undermine the peaceful fabric of our tolerant, multicultural society.
