        Today I have some very good news for commuters in my electorate. I have recently received updates from the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transport_and_Main_Roads" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Transport and Main Roads
        </a>
        regarding the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
         Gateway Motorway
        </a>
        merge upgrade at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Mile_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Eight Mile Plains
        </a>
        . This is one of many vital upgrades of the M1 taking place under the Queensland roads package deal reached by the Australian government earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The M1 is of course notorious for its peak-hour traffic. The southbound lanes of the M1 between Eight Mile Plains and Rochedale in particular are plagued by congestion during the afternoon peak hours. I and the state member for Mansfield, Mr Ian Walker, have regularly heard from constituents about how traffic in these lanes now starts to back up as early as 2 pm and does not ease until as late as 6 pm. We have been pushing for an upgrade on their behalf, so we are thrilled that work to widen the M1 at the Gateway Motorway merge past the Rochedale Road off ramp will begin later this year. More specifically, the upgrade will include up to five southbound lanes on the M1 between Eight Mile Plains and Rochedale, the relocation of the existing bus entry from Eight Mile Plains bus station onto the M1, a replacement four-lane overpass on a realigned Underwood Road, and managed motorway technologies from Klumpp Road to Rochedale Road.
       </p>
       <p>
        This upgrade is a major win for commuters who use this part of the M1 on a daily basis. They will enjoy improved traffic flow, reduced traffic times as well as improved safety. The Department of Transport and Main Roads is currently finalising the design of the upgrade. It has also contacted landowners impacted by the upgrade and will deal with them directly on a case-by-case basis. Early works on the project are expected to commence later this year, with major construction to begin following the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. I cannot wait to see this much-needed project completed. I encourage residents and motorists with more questions about the upgrade to contact my office for further information or visit the Department of Transport and Main Roads's website.
