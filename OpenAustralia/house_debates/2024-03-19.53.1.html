             This decision is a reflection of the good progress that we are making as a country in the fight against inflation. It gives us confidence that inflation is moderating in welcome and encouraging ways. Inflation has come off very substantially since its peak in 2022. And as I said a moment ago, in quarterly terms, inflation is now around a third of what we inherited from those opposite, and we know from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Bureau of Statistics
             </a>
             that our policies are contributing to the moderation and inflation. The budget restraint has given us the first surplus in 15 years, but we also know that the combination of our policies on electricity bill relief, early childhood education and rent assistance—

              <p>
               We also know that it's not anything like 'mission accomplished', because people are still under considerable cost-of-living pressure. This is why our cost-of-living relief—including our tax cuts—is so important and it's why it has been designed to take the pressure off inflation rather than add to these inflationary pressures. It's also why we've ensured that we can fund tens of billions of dollars in cost-of-living help at the same time as we clean up the mess that those opposite left behind in the budget. People are under pressure—we acknowledge that—but because of our efforts people are earning more and they are keeping more of what they earn, inflation is moderating, the budget is in better nick, and the default market offer, as the energy minister said a moment ago, shows price reductions in the electricity market.

               </a>
               governor has said before that our efforts in the budget have been very positive and very helpful in this fight against inflation. The governor will have an opportunity to expand on and explain the decision that they have taken today at the press conferences that the Governor Bullock has undertaken to do after each decision. I think this is a really good change; it has been well supported and it has been well received. It's one of a number of really important initiatives that came out of the Reserve Bank review undertaken by this government, and I encourage the parliament to support the other review recommendations as well.
