       <p>
        I can certainly attest to the words of the Prime Minister on early childhood education earlier today. I am pleased and proud of the fact that, due to the introduction of the cheaper childcare bill by the Minister for Education, early childhood education will become significantly cheaper for virtually every family in Hasluck. At a time when budgets are tight, this government has taken action that means about 5Â½ thousand families in Hasluck have another reason to smile. Indeed, over one million families will be smiling.
       </p>
       <p>
        We campaigned on this issue, and the government is now delivering. In my electorate, it was an issue and a campaign promise that certainly resonated with voters. To some, this simply will be a welcome respite in a difficult economic environment. To others, it will mean more than that; it will be the difference between working or not working, or between child care and no child care. I remember meeting a nurse who is a young mother while I was doorknocking in Ellenbrook. She told me that she only worked night shifts, so that she could be at home during the day with her young ones. It didn't add up for her to work days and pay for child care. She was tired and stressed and obviously really needed support. If we are not here to help people in difficulty then why are we here? With this significant boost in early education funding, this government will deliver for people in Hasluck and across Australia.

        <p>
         It's been nine long years since Labor delivered a budget, and it's clear they still don't know what they are doing. The government's $4.5 billion childcare package will not deliver for families, workers or the sector. They have no plan for access, no plan for workers and no plan to address thin markets and childcare deserts. The Prime Minister simply wasn't listening this afternoon when I outlined that what I meant was: the coalition will not oppose this bill. He wasn't listening. We moved an amendment to point out the enormous faults in this legislation, for the benefit of our youngest Australians and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government needs to be upfront with families and explain how they plan to increase access to services, when their policy will put high demand on a system already under pressure. There is no point in $4.5 billion in subsidies if families who need it most can't access care for their children. The government has failed to address current workforce shortages, which, from July next year, will put further pressure on educators. Without a plan to increase access and to increase the pipeline of educators and retain them in the sector, this policy will leave children worse off. They have not addressed the issues in the sector. They have not addressed access issues. They have not addressed workforce issues. There is not one new place for early childhood in this country, thanks to this Albanese government.
