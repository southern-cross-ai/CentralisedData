        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park" rel="nofollow">

              Economic stimulus is being delivered urgently to support jobs now—something, of course, which is not an economic goal of the Liberal Party as stated by the shadow Treasurer—and also to provide the biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history. It is true that, in order to deliver urgent economic stimulus to support tradespeople and their jobs today, we did ask state governments and local and Catholic education authorities to expedite the delivery of this program. I say to the shadow minister opposite: I really think we are getting to a fairly interesting stage in this debate if it is being suggested that it is a federal government responsibility to deal with a planning dispute about the removal of trees. I think the fact that the Liberal Party has come into this parliament to raise that point says everything about the absolute absurdity of its attitude to a global recession.

                <p>
                 Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The point of order—or the interjection disguised as a point of order—makes the very point that it is not federal development rules that have been suspended, and planning matters are matters for state governments. But I make this point: it amazes and concerns me that in the middle of a global recession, the biggest economic downturn in 75 years, when a global economic storm is hitting this country and costing Australia jobs, the biggest thing on the mind of the federal opposition in question time in the national parliament is a matter involving a planning dispute about a number of trees in a suburb in Unley. It says everything about being out of touch, out of ideas and out of any contact with reality. If they try focusing on the big picture—jobs today—and try actually developing some education policies, the Liberal Party might find that someone, sometime, somewhere takes them seriously.
