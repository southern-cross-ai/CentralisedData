       <p>
        This morning I rise to extend my congratulations and sincerest gratitude for the work that Gary Sansom, a member of my electorate, has put into the Queensland Farmers' Federation over the last two decades. Gary was at the table for the formation of the Queensland Farmers' Federation in 1992. The Queensland Farmers' Federation unites 16 of Queensland's peak rural industry organisations who collectively represent more than 13,000 primary industry producers across the state. Queensland Farmers' Federation is a federation of the major rural commodities organisations and value-adders working on behalf of all primary producers and rural communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        A humble man, Gary has received many accolades for his achievements. Some of those are: President of the Queensland Chicken Growers Association 1992 to 2010, and prior to that he was the vice-president from 1985-1992. He is currently also the co-vice-president. He was president of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, president of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation. He was a member of the Chicken Meat Industry Committee and Chairman of Farmsafe Queensland since 2004. He was also awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his contribution to the development of sustainable agriculture practices and promoting environmental and biosecurity management systems within the chicken industry. He has been awarded the prestigious Noel Milne Queensland Poultry Award, which recognises persons who have made significant contributions to the poultry industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to these outstanding achievements and being the recipient of many awards of notoriety, Gary has played an incredible role in making the Queensland Farmers' Federation the well-respected and functional organisation that it is. He has made an outstanding contribution to the organisation, its people and to the rural policy of Queensland. Gary is standing down from that organisation but will be staying on as a director.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to Gary this morning and I asked him about his outstanding achievements in the last couple of decades. He alluded to his contributions to food policy and agricultural policy in Queensland and Australia, and he was still robust and upbeat about the positive outlook for the future of the industry. Whilst he is standing down as president, he will still remain as a working director concentrating on biosecurity issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge his wife Julie Sansom, who has been a pillar of strength to Gary while he pursued rigorously the interests of the state's farming communities. As mentioned, Julie has continued to maintain the family operations and deserves praise for her contribution to Gary's achievements. Having visited their family operations this time last year, I can say that they run a first-class facility.
