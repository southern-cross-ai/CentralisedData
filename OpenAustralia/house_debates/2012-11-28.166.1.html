        I rise to pay tribute to the many wonderful people in the Hindmarsh electorate who choose to serve their community through their good volunteer works. Volunteers who contribute so much through their clubs, organisations, churches and other networks truly are the cornerstone of our community. I know that we all have them in our electorates.
       </p>

        Some volunteers have been nominated by their peers for a 2012 National Volunteers Award for their exceptional contributions to our community. Vivien Shae has taught English and served the Chinese community through Chinese Welfare Services in a variety of positions since 2004. She has also been chair of the Chinese Ethnic School and puts hours and hours of volunteer work into the Chinese Ethnic School. Pamela Nayda of Lockleys Senior Citizens Club has held the position of president and secretary of the club for 14 years, handling all aspects of the club's organisation and functioning, as well as assisting club members in their daily lives. I visit them on a regular basis and see firsthand the great work that Pamela Nayda does for the community.

        is a volunteer at West Beach Primary School. He is on the governing council and helps with school planning, working bees, extra tuition for students and the school concert, which he puts together every year—all this as a volunteer. Barbara Biggins has volunteered with the

        on Children and the Media and its forerunners for almost 40 years, spearheading its advocacy work and promoting healthy media experiences for children. It is very important work and, again, she is a volunteer. Marion Sullivan has also volunteered with the Australian Council on Children and the Media and its forerunners for almost 40 years, the last 20 with the condition of chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Marion has acted as company secretary, treasurer, children's film festival coordinator and other roles.

        Another great person in the electorate, and a very good friend of mine, is Francesco Violi. Frank, as we all know him within the western suburbs, in the

He organises social events, including picnics, for senior people of the local Italian community, as well as a whole range of other things. He offers a great service for some of our older constituents.

        Lorelei Siegloff has been an active volunteer and community member of Torrensville Primary School over the last three years, including two years as governing council chairperson, contributing to the community. She also has convened the community garden action group since 2010. Both Bill and Hildegarde Dow have been nominated by the All Saints Uniting Church council. They spend many hours each week in pastoral care, looking after people of their congregation, visiting people in hospitals, nursing homes and retirement villages, and assisting people in need everywhere. Another great person is Wayne Honeychurch, who has contributed a great deal to the South Australian Veterans Touring Group. My office has a lot to do with Wayne Honeychurch, who has been raising funds for orphanages in Vietnam for a number of years. The group raises funds and distributes the goods in Vietnam. They help to keep the orphanage groups in Vietnam up and running.

Mary Rogan became a member of Immanuel college's Parents and Friends Association in 1980 and has volunteered in and around the college ever since.
