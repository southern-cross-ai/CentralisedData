       <p>
        I would like to expand on some comments that I made in the House earlier this week involving Australia's tourism sector, a sector that I described as forming an invaluable element of strength for our nation. Every single member in this House has an obligation to not only protect that sector but promote it. Therefore, I have called for the comments of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough" rel="nofollow">

        two weeks ago, before a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        parliamentary inquiry, to be called out by every single member of this House. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I will never forget diving on the [

        ] reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms of life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white …
       </p>
       <p>
        That message, broadcast around the world, tells potential tourists to Australia: 'Don't bother coming to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        , because it is stark white. It is bleached white.' But David Attenborough forgot to tell that committee that four years ago he actually filmed a documentary on the Great Barrier Reef which described it as 'the perfect coral reef' and in which he filmed and documented the Great Barrier Reef in all its magnificent colour and wonders. When he promoted that film back in December 2015—remember, that's four years ago—he described Australia's Great Barrier Reef as 'fantastic', 'breathtaking' and 'a dream'. Yet now he sits before a UK parliamentary committee and creates the impression that it is all stark white, that it is all bleached white.
       </p>
       <p>
        No-one denies that parts of the reef are damaged from time to time by cyclones and coral bleaching. The science tells us that this has been happening for hundreds of years. But, today, the reef remains in good shape. It's a great place for Australians and for visitors from around the world to come and visit. But the sector is currently struggling. We have seen

        announce that they are pulling out of Cairns. That is four flights a week lost from

        should apologise. He should apologise for misleading that UK parliamentary inquiry, he should apologise to the Australian people and he should apologise to the people of Cairns, who will be hurt by his reckless and misleading comments.
