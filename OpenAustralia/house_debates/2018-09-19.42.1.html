        For most people the word 'pathology' means only one thing, but recently I was shown that it means much more than needles and blood tests. I am proud to have one of Australia's largest pathology laboratories in my electorate for Bonner. Recently, I joined John from Pathology Awareness Australia and Dr Debra Norris, John and Peter from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML" rel="nofollow">
         QML
        </a>
        for an inside look at their local lab. Located in Murarrie, QML serves people from all over Queensland, from Minister Karen Andrews's electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        all the way up to Warren Entsch's electorate of Leichhardt and everywhere in between. The laboratory employs more than 800 people, including scientists, clinical lab technicians, administrators and pathologists. Let me tell you, it is much more than blood tests. Pathology is front and centre of the prevention, early detection and management of disease, which I got to see first firsthand at the lab at Murarrie.

        Using pathology testing, scientists and doctors are now able to identify causes of diseases and genetic anomalies at the cellular level, as well as being able to tailor treatments for patients based on pathology results. It is exciting medical work and is happening right here in our own backyard in Bonner. The coalition supports the pathology industry. We are spreading the message that it is not something to be afraid of. I was pleased to take part in the detecting diabetes event held right here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        last month and the prostate cancer test last week. I urge others to do the same. Pathology testing allows for early detection of health conditions, which results in better health outcomes. Seventy per cent of medical treatment decisions are based on pathology testing.
