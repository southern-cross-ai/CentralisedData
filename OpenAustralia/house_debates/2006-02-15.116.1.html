        Back in 2003 I told the House of the Beattie government’s ambulance levy, whereby the Queensland Labor government imposed, in effect, yet another tax on residents to provide ambulance services. The levy was paid via an $88 charge on every electricity account in Queensland per year and was established to fund the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Ambulance_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Ambulance Service
        </a>
        . Ostensibly, the levy provides ambulance cover for every Queenslander but, in effect, is an example of how the Queensland Labor government is taxing people by stealth and failing to provide even the most rudimentary of ambulance services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the old system in Queensland you paid $98 for your whole family for a year. But now you can see how quickly things have changed in Queensland—beautiful one day, stuffed up the next. Not only has the ambulance levy gone to $92.55 since its implementation, raking in another $110 million for the Queensland government, but the once great ambulance service is now in a shambles, with crews having to transport patients from one hospital to the next in a vain attempt to find a functioning emergency ward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent research shows an increase in ambulance trips from 460,000 a year to 688,000 in the last financial year. Whether the increase in usage is due to an ageing population or people looking to get the most out of their compulsory levy is open to speculation. But there is one thing the Queensland government cannot deny: the appalling condition of the state’s public health services. Where once we had a workable public health system, we now have serious doctor shortages. Where once we had functioning hospitals, we now have emergency departments closing down due to staff shortages. Just a matter of weeks ago—in fact, on 25 January—a fire crew had to give emergency first aid to a

        man who had had a heart attack, because the ambulances were too busy transporting patients from Caboolture hospital to other hospitals. Imagine having to go in on the back of a fire engine!

          That is no credit to the Labor governments which allow it to occur. A real-life taxpayer funded ambulance crew did not arrive at the scene for 1½ hours because they were too busy transporting other patients to hospitals that were actually functioning. If ambulances are going to be treated as taxis with fire engines being sent in their place, what exactly is the ambulance levy providing to Queenslanders? Premier Beattie promised a fair and reliable ambulance service for Queenslanders. He has yet to deliver on that promise.
