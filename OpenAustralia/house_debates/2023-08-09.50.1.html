       <p>
        I rise to inform the House that six primary schools in Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        have been awarded up to $25,000 in much needed funding from the federal government to upgrade school infrastructure and equipment. I recently welcomed the federal education minister to Robertson to announce the six schools who are receiving funding through the $32 million Schools Upgrade Fund. The education minister and I visited the magnificent Pretty Beach Public School, one of six schools to receive this funding. The teachers and students were so kind to allow the minister and I to see some of the great learning that takes place at their school and how

        technology, like laptops, supports engagement and learning in the classroom. Pretty Beach Public School will be using their funding to purchase and upgrade ICT equipment, including new laptops, to ensure all students are able to have their own device. I want to thank Pretty Beach Public School for the warm welcome of both the education minister and me, and I again congratulate the school on their funding. I would also like to congratulate the other five schools in Robertson who will also receive funding: Yattalunga Valley Christian School,

        Central School, Somersby Public School, Kulnura Public School and Central Mangrove Public School. A special thank you goes to assistant principals at Pretty Beach Public School, Emma Gordon and Gillian Hickey, for organising the visit, as well as student leaders Freddie, Fletcher and Floraâ€”thank you. I'm pleased the Albanese government is investing in our nation's future and supporting high-quality education across Australia and on the Central Coast.
