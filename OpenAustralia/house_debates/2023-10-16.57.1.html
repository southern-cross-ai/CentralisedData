         . The referendum on Saturday did not return the result that I'd hoped for, but I respect the decision and the democratic process that produced it. In this country, we can make the big decisions peacefully and as equals. We know that referendums are hard. That's why only eight of 45 have passed, none without bipartisan support. I certainly accept responsibility for the decisions that I have taken.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was a constitutional change asked for, requested—an invitation from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         . I accepted that invitation and I followed through on the commitments that I made. Australians did not accept the constitutional change that was proposed, but no-one is arguing for the status quo. No-one can say that just keeping doing the same thing is good enough for Australia. What has occurred in recent times is a much greater national awareness. We need to channel that into a national purpose to find the answers. The referendum was about listening to people and about getting better outcomes, and these principles will continue to guide me.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will continue to listen to people and to communities and consult with Indigenous Australians about a way forward—

           because the issues we sought to address have not gone away, nor have the people of goodwill and good heart who want to address them. We will address them with hope in our heart, with faith in each other and with kindness towards one another, walking together in a spirit of unity and healing. The great Australian story goes back some 65,000 years. We have an opportunity as parliamentarians to write the next chapter. As a government, we have a responsibility to write the next chapter as well, a chapter that sees the gap closing because we know that only four out of 19 targets are on track as we speak. Australians know that that is not good enough, and that is why we must seek to achieve that change.

                 I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her rhetoric. Let's be very clear here about what occurred. There was a constitutional convention. There was one established under the former government, in 2017, after a process, under

                 , to establish a working group who were charged with coming back to the Australian people about what form constitutional recognition should take. That was after

                  : I've mentioned it a number of times. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence, and I'm asking for the same courtesy to be given to the Prime Minister. You'll leave the chamber under 94(a).

                   After a process in 2017,

                   people, through the Uluru Statement from the Heart, those eloquent 440 words, issued an invitation to Australians to walk with them on the form of recognition they sought, which was recognition through a voice. There were then processes established, including, under the former government, the Calma-Langton report and other processes, such as the joint committee chaired by
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dodson" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   and Julian Leeser, to progress this issue. I said, before the election, on a range of occasions, as did both leaders—

                   What occurred was that I fulfilled that commitment that I made. This wasn't out of convenience; it was out of conviction. I believe that when you make a commitment, including a commitment to Indigenous people, it should be fulfilled. I'll make this point. Across remote areas dominated by Indigenous communities, 'yes' recorded massive support: Wadeye, 92 per cent; the Tiwis, 84 per cent; Maningrida, 88 per cent;
