        I rise today to honour the lives of Robert 'Bob' Bower, Robert 'Bob' Everitt and Major General Brian 'Hori' Howard, AO,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We sadly lost our Robert 'Bob' Bower on 30 March 2024. Bob was an extremely valued member of the Illawarra community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , and he will be dearly missed. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Anne, his kids, Martin and Melissa, Lisa and Gerard, Jono and Sharon, Phil and Natalie, and his 13 adoring grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very jealous of Bob and Anne 's retirement, and they remain my pin-up couple for a great retirement. Bob's life was filled with travel and dedication to his three passions: the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael's" rel="nofollow">
         St Michael's
        </a>
        church at Thirroul, sailing and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob joined the ALP in February 1988, and through his 36 years of membership his contributions were outstanding. During his time as secretary, Bob went above and beyond for the older members of the Thirroul branch by making house visits to those who couldn't travel to the monthly meetings. Bob, with his beloved wife, Anne, helped to organised the annual Thirroul branch dinner, which first started in 1966. They took great pride in preparing a wonderful three course home-cooked meal for 80 to 90 members each year. I loved watching them together in the organised chaos they had in the kitchen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was pivotal in our election campaigns. You would always find him on prepoll and on polling day at Thirroul Library and St Michael's school. He did this on my first election campaign in ill health, and I am forever grateful for this. He always went above and beyond for us and we are so very grateful.
       </p>
       <p>
        We sadly lost Robert 'Bob' Everitt on 15 May 2024. Bob Everitt is survived by his children, Jim, Louise, Belinda and Mandy, and their partners, Glen, Dave and Peter, his 10 grandchildren and his six great-grandchildren. He is now reunited with his adoring wife, Barbara.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob met Barb at a dance when he was completing his studies at teachers college, where he was studying to be a manual arts teacher. They married in 1952 and were inseparable ever since. There was no Bob without Barb. Their marriage had spanned just shy of 70 years when he lost Barb in 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob had a very successful and fulfilling teaching career spanning almost 40 years, teaching thousands of students. He taught at four schools around the state, starting at the local high school in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Broken Hill
        </a>
        and then moving to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macksville_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Macksville High School
        </a>
        , then

         Figtree High School
        </a>
        , then

         Kanahooka High School
        </a>
        and then returning to Figtree High School before retirement. Bob has been described as a natural teacher. He would constantly encourage and validate students. He was passionate about politics and was a member of the Labor Party for over a decade. Bob's family have described him as a man who was extremely patient and never got angry, except for when

        was dismissed. His warm and happy presence will be missed dearly and may he rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        We sadly lost Major General Brian 'Hori' Howard on 16 May 2024. I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Major General Howard. He was a good friend to all who knew him and he will be dearly missed.

        He had a very distinguished military career from 1959 to 1990. He commanded a battalion and an infantry brigade. He was Director-General of Operations and Plans for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in recognition of his leadership in Vietnam among other service medals.
       </p>
       <p>
        From late 1989 to mid-2001, Major General Howard was appointed Director-General of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        . He was one of the longest serving directors-general in the SES. The current New South Wales emergency management system is largely his design. He was awarded the Emergency Services Medal for his efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hori has been a longstanding member of the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , where he joined in May 1992, and was still an active and contributing member until his passing. He was very active in fundraising and organising commemorative events in the Illawarra. He was particularly proud to be involved in the restoration of the Austinmer World War I memorial. He was also very passionate about welfare and support for veterans and those still serving. He had so much knowledge of the RSL, and we all loved his cheeky sense of humour. His dedication, leadership and courage have left a significant legacy. May he rest in peace.
