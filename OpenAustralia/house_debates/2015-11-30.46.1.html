        The north and the southern wings of my electorate are home to many of the metropolitan thoroughbred racing breeding stables, including Darley's Osborne Park and Princes Farm, owned by the late

        to expand its Drayton South project. This decision will help give certainty to the 5,633 racing employees that work in

        . Had Drayton South been given the green light, there is little doubt that much of the industry would have relocated to Victoria. Had Darley relocated their stud, it would have cost some 90 racing jobs in the electorate of Lindsay, not to mention the extensive small business support that they also need to maintain their operations. Henry Plumptre of Darley said:

       <p class="italic">
        The Planning Assessment Commission has considered the Drayton South proposal on three occasions. They have used the strongest language yet regarding the need for the thoroughbred industry to be recognised as a viable one. As a result they have called for protections and buffer zones to be put in place. Remaining viable is good news for jobs, both in the Hunter and Western Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Henry went on to say that key points of the terms are the renewed investment, the growth of the industry and the certainty that the protection zones and the buffer zones for the thoroughbred industry will bring. I call on the
