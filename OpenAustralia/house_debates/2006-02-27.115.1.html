        I have to say I have been absolutely appalled at the contributions by the honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Prospect in criticising the appointment of Mr Warburton and Mr Hendy to look after this inquiry by the Treasurer into the Australian tax system. The suggestion is that we have waited in government for 10 years before looking at possible changes and improvements to the tax system. The simple fact is that we have been in office for 10 years and the government, led by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Leader of the National Party, has done an outstanding job. However, the job is never finished; it is always important to look at ongoing improvements and at changed circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not think of two more suitable people than Mr Hendy and Mr Warburton to lead this inquiry. I am pleased that it is not one of these ‘never never’ inquiries. It has a very finite period for reporting. It indicates that the Treasurer and the government have a real vision for the future. These two people, who have broad experience in government and in industry, will be able to look very closely at what we are doing well and what we are not doing well. They will be able to bring forward advice which will be considered by the government for possible implementation to improve a tax system which is much better than the tax system this government inherited in 1996. I did not intend to rise to talk about this subject, but I was motivated by the quite appalling contributions by the two previous Labor speakers.

        It gives me pleasure to draw attention in the House tonight to two residents of my electorate who are proving that age is no barrier to fundraising. The two men are Alan Lawley, aged a sprightly 83, and Hendrick ‘Hank’ Drent, a young 69. Alan struggles to put pen to paper due to arthritis and his eyesight, unfortunately, is not as good as it used to be. But there is no way he will let those minor problems slow him down. Meanwhile, his best mate, Hank, admits he is a bit hard of hearing—a legacy of years labouring in the mines of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . However, he has also resolved not to allow any such niggles get in the way of a busy life helping his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan and Hank have become somewhat famous on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        hinterland for their clever idea of visiting local orchards and collecting avocado seconds—those that are deemed too small for market—and then selling them in Maleny. The money they make goes towards helping the local Erowal retirement village. Despite the personal difficulties they face, the two have risen to become living treasures in the region. The best friends have raised approximately $17,000 for their local community, and they have no plans yet for retirement. Their achievements were recognised at the Australia Day Fisher community awards ceremony for services to their community. These two men are living examples of what it means to be Australian—they are dedicated to their fellow citizens and they have made a huge effort to contribute significant portions of their time to help their local community.

        Fundraising, as we all know, is always a difficult pursuit. It involves putting in a lot of effort and long hours for very little reward. But these two mates have persevered and are making a real difference. They are truly an inspiration to us all. Despite the proud accolade, Alan and Hank remain modest. ‘Hank does all the hard work,’ Alan says. ‘He takes the avocados home, washes them, sorts them out and puts them into bags. He calls me his technical adviser. I do all the organising, make the phone calls and put things in the local newspaper—that sort of thing.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Whatever the demarcation of tasks, the duo’s special bond and unique teamwork are making an impact. Their efforts so far have paid for two televisions and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        player for special care residents at the retirement village; their earnings also funded the restoration of a donated piano and the installation of two airconditioning units, valued at over $4,600, at the nursing home. They are currently raising funds for another two airconditioning units. The fundraising efforts paid for a war memorial that is located near the front door of the nursing home, and they have also contributed $7,500 towards a hydrotherapy pool soon to be built in Maleny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hank and Alan met about five years ago through their involvement with the Freemasons. With Alan growing frail with old age, Hank started visiting him every morning to check on his welfare. That thoughtful deed developed into a strong bond of friendship. ‘We’ve become good mates,’ Hank says proudly. ‘I go there every morning. I never miss a day and I will keep on looking out for him.’ The pair also sells raffle tickets at Maleny, but as a fundraising method it is a little too competitive. Avocado seconds will remain their ‘bread and butter’—this season they hope to raise more than $1,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        They get their support from avocado growers Mr and Mrs Ken Webb of Woombye and Mr and Mrs Ian Goodall of Curramore. The avocado seconds are growing in popularity. Hank says, ‘People love them. They always ask when we will get more. It started five years ago. It went well, so we’re still doing it.’ This special partnership has proved that age and disability are no hurdles for those who genuinely desire to give something back to their community. In the House I want to honour to Alan and Hank. What they are doing is extraordinary.
