        Our community will be celebrating the opening of the new premises for Hope Horizons, the

        Cancer Wellness Centre, on Saturday 6 April. This is a fantastic occasion. There are very few projects that I've seen in my community that have had such great support from locals, and I want to go through and thank a few of them. I'll start with Jo Capp, who had this driving energy behind her to make sure that this project was delivered. She's done a great job. Harvey and Jenny Black have supported this all the way through. They even increased their support to help the project overcome different obstacles. Kehoe Myers Consulting Engineers did all of the engineering for this project for free. This is a project that hopes to diminish the impact of cancer for patients by providing a holistic approach, and it's a fantastic thing to get behind. Feather &amp; Lawry Design provided all of the architectural works for freeâ€”another local company doing great things. The people at Gather &amp; Graze, a group of young legends trying to make our community that much better, put $300,000 towards this.

        This matters in our region. We are a health hub. We are a health hub not just for Toowoomba region but for western Queensland and northern
