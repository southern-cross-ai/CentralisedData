        I am delighted to announce the round 1 recipients of the 2015-16 Solomon local sporting champions grants. Each recipient will receive $500 towards their travel and accommodation costs to attend their national championship event. I congratulate 13 local sporting stars.

        Darcy Elliston is a netball player who was selected to play in the under-17s netball championship in Sydney. She has been playing netball since she was eight years old and was very excited to be able to represent the

        Sophie Hatzismalis from Millner was selected for the first time to represent the Northern Territory as part of the under-15s netball championships. We may have another Diamonds star there as well. Badminton player Pitchaya Viravong has been selected to represent the Northern Territory in the Australian under-15 championships in a months time. We are wishing her all the very best.

Jenti White will represent the Territory in swimming later this year, also at the Pacific School Games, and I am sure the swim team will do us proud. Tjina Stoll will represent the Territory in soccer at the Pacific Games. Last year she was picked in the reserve squad, so she is pretty happy that she has been selected this year to play.
