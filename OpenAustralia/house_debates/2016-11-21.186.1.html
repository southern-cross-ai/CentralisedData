        Volunteers play a critical role in our community. They work tirelessly for the benefit of others. It is estimated that around six million Australians volunteer each year, including around 20,000 in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , so I am really pleased to be part of a government that backs our volunteers through our $10 million Volunteer Grants program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last funding round assisted more than 30 community organisations in my electorate. These included the Umina Beach Men's Shed, who used their grant to roll out first aid training and to help with the purchase of new equipment. The Kincumber Neighbourhood Centre were able to upgrade their computers and buy new kitchen appliances. And the local Stroke Recovery Association could reimburse fuel costs so that they could travel the Central Coast region and assist more people face-to-face who have suffered a stroke. There were also direct benefits delivered to groups like the Central Coast Potters Society, Chertseydale Community Cottage, Kariong Community Care, Point Clare Public School P&amp;C, the Spencer Community Progress Group, and Marine Rescueâ€”all outstanding organisations in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to encourage all local volunteer organisations to consider applying in the next round of the Volunteer Grants program, which is now open. There are grants for between $1,000 and $5,000, with priority given to organisations working in disadvantaged communities or affected by natural disasters. Applications close on 20 December, and I would encourage interested volunteer groups to contact my office for more details. Again, on behalf of our community I thank our hard-working volunteers for all that they do for our communities.
