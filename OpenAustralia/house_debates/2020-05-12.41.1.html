        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the implementation of the national cabinet's agreed three-step plan to reopen a COVID-safe Australia and economy?

         I thank the member for Bennelong for his question.

         also say, at the commencement of this answer, that the three-step plan that was announced last Friday that is now being implemented by the states and territories would not have been possible without the work that was done to put the protections in place from the closing of the borders early in February through to the work that is being done to get access to personal protective equipment, the testing kits, the COVIDSafe app, all of this, but critical amongst that was the amazing discipline and support shown by the Chinese-Australian community. I know the member for Bennelong, as so many represent here, represents those Australians, and their initial lockdown and isolation in response to the COVID-19 virus was something extraordinary and set the tone and example for all other Australians to follow. I know the member for Bennelong would be very proud of his community to that end, as the member for Chisholm would and so many others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday we announced the three-step plan, the first step being to carefully reopen our economy, and that process is now well underway as we're allowing gatherings of up to 10 people. This has been a very difficult thing for Australians to live with in recent months, but their patience has paid off and we thank them for that patience as we now move to reopen the Australian economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second step moves to another level of reopening of the Australian economy, and that particularly draws on the wisdom and experience of businesses and industry to develop their COVID-safe plans. When Australians are returning to work, as we are here in this place—as we have been working in our own electorate offices or other places around the country but returning to this parliament—COVID-safe arrangements have been put in place. I particularly want to commend the work that has been done by the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
          Industrial Relations
         </a>
         and the Attorney-General, working together with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
          Greg Combet
         </a>
         and the COVID commission, to ensure that there are Safe Work Australia guidelines and protocols to be followed to ensure that Australians can return to work in a safe way.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're seeing children back at school. We're seeing those in-classroom learnings undertaken again as I know the Minister for Education and I are very pleased about. That is the best place for children to learn, in a classroom. We may lose many things throughout the course of this COVID-19 crisis, but we have taken all steps we can to ensure that a year's worth of a child's education is not lost. I welcome the decisions that have been taken by the states and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third step really goes to the next level of getting us to a place in July where we have a COVID-safe economy, with Australians back in jobs, businesses open again and we are at a whole new level of our economy operating and we'll see more and more Australians in a position to be supported by the economy and not the taxpayer. Because, at the end of the day, this government has no other funds than those provided by the Australian people. We are grateful for that support and the hard work of Australians and businesses who provided that taxation revenue. We will ensure that it's always put to the best possible use in supporting Australians at this time.
