        Madam Speaker, on indulgence, I wish to note that this is the 10th anniversary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         White Ribbon
        </a>
        Day here in Australia. White Ribbon Day is an opportunity for all of us to recommit ourselves to the struggle against violence directed towards women. I would love to be able to say that violence against women was a thing of the past, but to suggest that it was would be to mislead this parliament. Regrettably, on average once a week a woman in Australia is a fatal casualty of domestic violence. Most regrettably, one woman in three has experienced physical violence, invariably at the hands of men.
       </p>
       <p>
        So this is an appropriate occasion to rededicate ourselves to this important task, to rededicate ourselves to letting the young men of our country, in particular, know that a strong man never practises violence. In particular, a strong man never practises violence against the vulnerable. In particular, a strong man is never responsible for violence against women. It is important that we all do what we can to ensure that this message gets out. It is important to do what we can to protect the women of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate, my wife and I have been responsible for helping to support the Manly Women's Shelter, for which the Pollie Pedal has raised some $300,000 over the last two years. But what we can do individually we can also help to do collectively, and I am pleased to be able to say, on the 10th anniversary of White Ribbon Day in this country, that the government today announced the pledging of an additional $1 million over the next four years to the work of White Ribbon Day, particularly in promoting amongst communities where this message is particularly urgent, the importance of respecting the dignity and the persons of women.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the father of three daughters, I am determined to do everything I can as a citizen and as a Prime Minister to ensure that all the women of Australia, and indeed all the women of the world, receive appropriate respect from their menfolk and never suffer violence at their hands.
       </p>

        <p>
         I rise on indulgence to speak on the same matter as the Prime Minister. The biggest risk factor for becoming a victim of sexual assault, domestic violence or family violence is being a woman. As the Prime Minister said, the statistics are chilling. That in our country at least one woman is killed every week by a current or former partner is shameful. Women and children experiencing domestic violence make up a third of the 230,000 who are recorded as homeless. These women and their children suffer physical, psychological, financial and emotional abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
         Violence against women and children is preventable. Some say that domestic violence is just a women's issue. But it is more. Some say that domestic violence is a state issue or a police issue. But it is more. Some say that domestic violence is a problem for the poor or for particular communities. But it is more. Domestic violence stretches across the length and breadth of all the postcodes of our nation. It is irrespective of your religion, your wealth or your ethnicity. Domestic violence, however, is too often narrowly defined, leaving women vulnerable and voiceless, sometimes unable to self-identify with the precariousness of the situations that they live in.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are myths and misunderstandings about the barriers that often work to prevent women from leaving violent relationships. It is not right that a woman in Australia is as likely to be assaulted in her own home as she is on the high street of Australia. It is not right that this will happen absolutely more often that not at the hands of men they know, often men they have known for a lifetime. When we have upwards of 250,000 Australians, predominantly women, being assaulted by people who say that they love them, then we as a nation have an obligation. This is not an issue on the margins, but it is one which we can all help deal with. We know it devastates lives and families. We know that domestic violence can be fuelled by alcohol and drugs. We know the long-term impact on children and future generations is heartbreaking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor is proud of its track record. Our National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children has been recognised by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         as world's best practice. We committed billions of dollars to homelessness, benefiting women and their children, offering them protection in their homes. We funded the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to ensure they have the resources they need.
        </p>

          White Ribbon
         </a>
         Day in a bipartisan and constructive manner, Labor says that, whilst we honour White Ribbon Day, we can do more in this parliament. We can continue to increase support to build more refuges; we can speak up for the homeless, making sure that home is safe and secure and that victims can stay home and the perpetrators leave; we can help victims of domestic violence keep their jobs or help find them new jobs so they can pay the rent; we can expand laws and programs; we can stand up for women in domestic violence refuges who do not existâ€”'do not exist' I say, because they are not eligible to access any government or Centrelink payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         I congratulate the government's announcement today for its further $1 million contribution to the White Ribbon Day campaign, following Labor's previous contributions. I congratulate the White Ribbon Day advocates for their tireless efforts. Like the Prime Minister, as a parent, I want both my sons and daughters to grow up knowing on the one hand that my daughters will be safe and that my boy will know to grow up to be a responsible adult. I thank White Ribbon for their efforts.
