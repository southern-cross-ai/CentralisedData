        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the shocking treatment received by Jack Zhang, a 457 visa holder, the latest in a long line of examples of workers being exploited and abused on these temporary visas. Can the Prime Minister confirm that Mr Zhang was sacked as soon as his $10,000 fee had been paid and that his employer, Mr Tu, has already been approved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        to sponsor another worker from China on a 457 visa to begin at the company next week? Will that new visa be immediately revoked and will his employer be immediately barred from sponsoring any more 457 visas? Prime Minister, three months ago the opposition asked for urgent action on these rorts. How much longer will it take to clean up this mess?

         <p>
          I am happy to provide members who are interested in the matter with a substantive answer. I am told Mr Zhang first approached the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
          </a>
          on 22 August this year. Mr Zhang was interviewed on the same day and the Office of Workplace Services was contacted on 23 August. The department interviewed Mr Zhang again on 28 August with the Office of Workplace Services in attendance. The Office of Workplace Services conducted a site visit this morning. The department also attempted to visit A-Print this morning to confirm the allegations. These site visits may provide a basis for imposing sanctions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many of the issues raised in the allegations are not permissible under 457 visa regulations and other Australian laws and, if proven, may have serious consequences for the employer. But, at least until the allegations are resolved, A-Print will not be permitted to sponsor any further workers. Another worker at A-Print had been sponsored. That person is overseas and the visa has been cancelled.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr Zhang will be given a reasonable opportunity to find another sponsor and, if he is unable to find another sponsor, his costs of return would be met by A-Print. Under the sponsorship undertakings, A-Print is responsible for minimum salary levels being met 28 days after notifying the department of cessation of employment. If there has been any underpayment, A-Print will need to make good those wages. A-Print remains responsible for a range of his further costs. The department has referred the allegations relating to rental arrangements to the Victorian office of fair trading.
