        Securing Australia ' s recovery
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is coming back.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the face of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the Australian spirit has shone through.
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctors and nurses on the front line.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teachers and students in the virtual classroom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Businesses, big and small, keeping the economy moving.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Team Australia' at its best.
       </p>
       <p>
        A nation to be proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we have come so far since the height of the pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Treasury feared unemployment could reach 15 per cent and the economy could contract by more than 20 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This would have meant more than two million Australians unemployed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would have been the equivalent of losing the agriculture, construction and mining sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, today the reality is very different.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ahead of any major advanced economy, Australia has seen employment go above its pre-pandemic levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 5.6 per cent, unemployment today is lower than when we came to government.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is remarkable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's fate could have been so much worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
         The United Kingdom
        </a>
        , France and Italy all contracted by more than eight per cent, Japan and Canada by around five per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, just 2.5 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the health front, the catastrophic loss of life seen elsewhere has been averted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early and decisive actions saved lives and livelihoods.
       </p>
       <p>
        We closed our borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister established the national cabinet.
       </p>
       <p>
        And unprecedented support is seeing the country through the biggest global economic shock since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        JobKeeper kept 3.8 million people in their job.
       </p>
       <p>
        JobSeeker helped 1.5 million people without work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cashflow boost supported over 800,000 businesses and not-for-profits.
       </p>
       <p>
        And additional payments went to millions of pensioners, carers, veterans and others on income support.
       </p>
       <p>
        All made possible because we entered this crisis from a position of economic strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic environment
       </p>
       <p>
        But, it has come at a significant and unavoidable cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        The COVID-19 recession will see our deficit reach $161 billion this year, falling to $57 billion in 2024-25.
       </p>
       <p>
        With more Australians back at work, this year's deficit is $52.7 billion lower than was expected just over six months ago in last year's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Net debt will increase to $617.5 billion or 30 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        this year and peak at $980.6 billion or 40.9 per cent of GDP in June 2025.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is low by international standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a share of the economy, net debt is around half of that in the United Kingdom and United States and less than a third of that in Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are better placed than nearly any other country in the world to meet the economic challenges that lie ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer sentiment is at its highest in 11 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business conditions reached record highs.
       </p>
       <p>
        And more Australians are in work than ever before.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our plan is working.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's economic engine is roaring back to life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the last budget, almost half a million jobs have been created.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I outline the Morrison government's plan to secure Australia's economic recovery and build for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        A plan that continues to protect Australians from COVID.
       </p>
       <p>
        A plan that creates more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        A plan that guarantees the essential services.
       </p>
       <p>
        And a plan that builds a more resilient and secure Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a plan that is guided by our enduring values.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reward for effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of aspiration and enterprise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upholding personal responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        And always providing a helping hand to those who need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what the coalition stands for.
       </p>
       <p>
        Securing the recovery and creating jobs
       </p>
       <p>
        Our first priority is to keep Australians safe from COVID.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, a further $1.9 billion is allocated for the rollout of vaccines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians have already received over 2.5 million doses.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget provides another $1.5 billion for COVID-related health services, including for testing and tracing, respiratory clinics and telehealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        In total the Morrison government has committed $20 billion to the vaccine rollout and to strengthen our health system in response to COVID.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tax relief
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's economic recovery is now well underway and we must keep the momentum going.
       </p>
       <p>
        In last year's budget, we promised hardworking Australians tax cuts and we delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        We promised the largest set of investment incentives and we delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        We promised more jobs and we delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was done without undermining the structural integrity of the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, this pandemic is not over.
       </p>
       <p>
        For as long as the virus persists, so will we.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight, we go further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Announcing that over 10 million low- and middle-income earners will benefit from a new and additional tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        A stimulus measure that will support the recovery and build on tax cuts that we announced in last year's budget and the budgets before that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Low- and middle-income earners will receive up to $1,080 for individuals or $2,160 for couples.
       </p>
       <p>
        More of their money in their pockets to spend across the economy, creating jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, taxes will always be lower, and hardworking Australian families will always be better off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eight out of 10 jobs are in the private sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        A sustainable recovery requires a strong private sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our record investment incentives are filling the order books of the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 99 per cent of businesses, employing over 11 million workers, can write off the full value of any eligible asset that they purchase.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has seen their spending on machinery and equipment increase at the fastest rate in nearly seven years.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, tonight, we again go further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Announcing the extension of these measures for a further year until 30 June 2023, so a tradie can buy a new ute, a farmer a new harvester and a manufacturer expand their production line.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing and small business
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, when construction work began to dry up, HomeBuilder came to the rescue.
       </p>
       <p>
        New house starts are now at their highest level in 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        New loans to first home buyers reached their highest level in nearly 12 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        HomeBuilder has been a huge success.
       </p>
       <p>
        And our $2 billion investment in affordable housing is bringing on more supply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, in this budget, our housing measures go even further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helping another 10,000 first home buyers build a new home with a five per cent deposit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supporting 10,000 single parents to purchase a home with as low as a two per cent deposit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Increasing the amount that can be released under the First Home Super Saver Scheme from $30,000 to $50,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, home ownership will always be supported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we know that some sectors and regions across the country continue to do it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why this budget provides a further $2.1 billion in targeted support for aviation, tourism, the arts and international education providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 800,000 half-price airfares.
       </p>
       <p>
        Support for more than 200 productions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grants to English language course providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        And extending our small business loan scheme, which has already helped more than 45,000 businesses access low-cost finance.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also providing tax relief for around 1,000 small brewers and distillers across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, small and family businesses are the engine room of our economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are at the heart of every local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As they strive to recover, we need the tax system to work for them, not against them.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight we provide small business with peace of mind that an independent umpire will stand between them and the tax office when it comes to debt recovery actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will take these disputes out of the courts and let small business get on with what they do best.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, small business will always be stronger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Record investment in skills and training
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we need to equip Australians with the skills that they need to get a job today and tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we double our commitment to the JobTrainer Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supporting a total of more than 450,000 new training places to upskill jobseekers and young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a cost of $2.7 billion, we will create 170,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Building on the 100,000 new apprentices we have already helped into a job in the first stage of the program.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will help more women break into non-traditional trades, with training support for 5,000 places.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we will provide 2,700 places in Indigenous girls academies to help them finish school and enter the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        And more
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        scholarships for women, in partnership with industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we are also providing another 5,000 places in higher education short courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        And better matching jobseekers to jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will invest in modernising employment services, including specialist assistance for young and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, for those who find themselves without work, the government has strengthened the safety net, increasing the JobSeeker payment while enhancing mutual obligations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Child care
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, child care is an important driver of higher workforce participation and women's economic security.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we are making a further and targeted $1.7 billion investment in child care.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will increase the affordability of child care for low- and middle-income families.
       </p>
       <p>
        250,000 families will be better off by an average of $2,200 each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Giving more parents, especially women, the choice to take on extra work.
       </p>
       <p>
        A dynamic and competitive economy
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, our economic plan capitalises on the opportunities that will exist on the other side of this crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Building the infrastructure our economy needs for the future with our 10-year, $110 billion infrastructure program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight we make $15 billion in additional infrastructure commitments including for:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In this budget we also invest a further $1 billion in road safety upgrades to save lives and a further $1 billion in local road infrastructure projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding for these shovel-ready projects will be provided on a use it or lose it basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        And through the Building Better Regions Fund, we will support a further $250 million of regional community infrastructure projects, creating more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, regional Australia will never be taken for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the pandemic we have seen how quickly Australians have adapted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changing the way we work, shop and communicate.
       </p>
       <p>
        A trend that will only accelerate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Digital infrastructure and digital skills will be critical for the competitiveness of our economy, creating massive opportunities for growth and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we are investing $1.2 billion in our Digital Economy Strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Establishing a new national network of artificial intelligence centres to drive business adoption of these new technologies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expanding our cybersecurity innovation fund to train the next generation of cybersecurity experts.
       </p>
       <p>
        And undertaking a digital skills cadetship trial which combines workplace and vocational training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, Australia's manufacturing sector will be a key driver of future jobs and higher wages.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why we have already committed $1.5 billion to expand manufacturing activity and create jobs across six priority areas, including medical products and clean energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        We backed in our Modern Manufacturing Strategy with an additional $2 billion in research and development tax incentives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has led the world with innovations like wi-fi, the bionic ear and a vaccine for cervical cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want to see more innovation commercialised in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        And so tonight, we are launching a new 'patent box' starting on 1 July next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the patent box, income earned from new patents that have been developed in Australia will be taxed at a concessional 17 per cent rate—almost half the rate that applies to large companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The patent box will apply to the medical and biotech sectors and we will consult on expanding it to the clean energy sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, Australia's effective management of COVID makes us an even more attractive place for the best and brightest from around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        To take advantage of this, we are streamlining visas to target highly skilled individuals when circumstances allow.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're simplifying our tax laws, including the treatment of employee share ownership schemes in line with the rest of the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        And we're improving Australia's competitiveness as a financial services sector and centre in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Guaranteeing essential services
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, our strong economy enables us to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, the Morrison government is providing record funding for schools, hospitals, Medicare, mental health, aged care and disability support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since coming to government, we have listed more than 2,600 medicines on the PBS, an average of one each and every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has put life-changing treatments within the reach of every Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we fund new medicines to treat breast cancer, lung cancer, severe osteoporosis and asthma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we announce the listing of Emgality to treat chronic migraines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of costing $6,800 per year for treatment it will now cost just $41.30 a script or $6.60 for concession card holders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is also providing in this budget new funding for endometriosis, research into pre-term birth and genetic testing for pregnant women.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is committed to ensuring Australians can access quality medical services no matter where they live.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why in this budget we will provide higher incentives to rural and regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s for bulk-billed services, helping to keep more doctors in the regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        National Disability Insurance Scheme
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        has made Australia a better country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Profoundly improving the lives of people with disability and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new wheelchair, home modifications, care in the home and transport to work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, 450,000 people are receiving disability support.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last year alone, more than 100,000 people have joined the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we will spend a further $13.2 billion over four years to meet the needs of Australians with disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the scheme reaches maturity, our focus is on ensuring its sustainability and that it continues to deliver a high-quality essential service for those who need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, the NDIS will always be fully funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aged care
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Aged Care Quality and Safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        It revealed shocking cases of neglect and abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we commit $17.7 billion in practical and targeted new funding to significantly improve the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will fund another 80,000 new home care packages, bringing the total to 275,000 home care packages that will be available.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will increase the time nurses and carers are required to spend with residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will make an additional payment of $10 per resident per day to enhance the viability and sustainability of the residential aged-care system.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will support over 33,000 new training places for personal carers, and a new Indigenous workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will provide retention bonuses to keep more nurses in aged care.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will increase access for respite services for carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will strengthen the regulatory regime to monitor and enforce standards of care.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will upgrade essential aged-care infrastructure in regional and remote areas around the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        This package brings our record investment in aged care to over $119 billion over the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to restoring trust in the system and allowing Australians to age with dignity and respect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mental health
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, everybody listening tonight knows somebody who is struggling with their mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suicide is the leading cause of death in Australia for those aged 18 to 44.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, over 65,000 of our fellow Australians attempt to take their own lives each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are not just statistics on a page. These are our family. These are our friends. These are our colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        In every budget, we have committed more resources to frontline services.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Blue" rel="nofollow">
         Beyond Blue
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Lifeline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kids Helpline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight we extend our support with a $2.3 billion commitment to mental health care and suicide prevention.
       </p>
       <p>
        More headspace centres to support more young Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expanding this model to those aged over 25, with a new Head to Health national network of 40 centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Increased funding for the treatment of people with eating disorders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greater access to psychiatrists, psychologists and GPs through Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Universal access to care for people who have been discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new National Suicide Prevention Office.
       </p>
       <p>
        And as the Prime Minister has announced, we will establish a Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have nearly doubled spending on mental health since we came to government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a clear national priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        It goes to the heart of who we are as Australians, helping those who need it most.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, in this budget the government is investing record funding in education.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have already doubled school funding since we came to office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our focus is on lifting student outcomes and better equipping teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight we also commit $2 billion to fund preschools, with reforms to improve participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Preschool is a vital time in a child's development and prepares them for the educational journey ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we are also providing more than $19 billion in funding for our universities in 2021-22.
       </p>
       <p>
        And as a result of decisions made during the pandemic, this year there are 30,000 more places at Australian universities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Women's safety
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, all Australians have the right to be safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is that, for too many women, this is not their experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        One in four women experience violence from a current or a former partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        This must stop.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must do all we can to end all forms of violence against women and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since we came to government we have invested more than $1 billion to keep women and children safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, we invest a further $1.1 billion in women's safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        Delivering more emergency accommodation.
       </p>
       <p>
        More legal assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        More counselling.
       </p>
       <p>
        More financial support, including cash payments for those escaping abusive relationships.
       </p>
       <p>
        More targeted services for Indigenous, migrant and refugee women and women with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will improve the family law system to better protect children, give victims of domestic violence greater access to justice and reduce the time spent in court.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, sexual harassment is unacceptable in any context.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it occurs in the workplace, it denies women their dignity, as well as their personal and economic security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government in its response to the
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        report is strengthening laws, guidance and standards to prevent and to address harassment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retirees
       </p>
       <p>
        We want all Australians to get the most out of the superannuation system.
       </p>
       <p>
        On average women retire with less superannuation than men.
       </p>
       <p>
        So tonight, the government will remove the current $450 per month minimum income threshold for the superannuation guarantee.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will improve economic security in retirement for around 200,000 women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our plan will also make it easier for Australians to prepare for retirement and to be more secure once in retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will improve flexibility by no longer requiring older Australians to meet a work test before they can make voluntary contributions to superannuation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will allow those aged over 60 to contribute up to $300,000 into their superannuation if they downsize their home, freeing up more housing stock for younger families.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will also enhance the Pension Loan Scheme by providing immediate access to lump sums of around $12,000 for singles and $18,000 for couples.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the coalition, Australian seniors will always have more control over their money.
       </p>
       <p>
        A resilient Australia
       </p>
       <p>
        COVID has not been the only challenge Australia has faced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Drought, bushfires, cyclones and floods.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget provides more resources to help Australians prepare, respond and recover from these natural disasters.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, Australia's biosecurity system protects more than $50 billion in agricultural exports and 1.6 million jobs from threats like African swine fever.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget will strengthen border screening controls and improve our ability to fight an outbreak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, a resilient Australia requires diverse and reliable supply chains.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why we are providing additional support for Australian manufacturers of critical products.
       </p>
       <p>
        And more funding to help small businesses and farmers expand and diversify their export markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, our industries and regions depend on affordable and reliable energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why the government is unlocking Australia's vast gas reserves in the North Bowen and Galilee Basins, and investing in hydrogen-ready gas plants.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also shoring up our fuel security by helping local refineries to keep operating here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, we are the custodians of this great continent for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget provides over $480 million in new funding for the environment, including $100 million to protect our oceans.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also upgrading our recycling capabilities, creating jobs and reducing waste sent to landfill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is playing its part on climate change too, having met our 2020 commitments and on track to meet and beat our 2030 target.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is on the pathway to net zero and our goal is to get there as soon as we possibly can, preferably by 2050.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will do this with a practical, technology-focused approach. Technology not taxes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already, we have the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world and are supporting major energy projects like Snowy 2.0 and Battery of the Nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this budget, we are investing a further $1.6 billion to fund priority technologies, including clean hydrogen and energy storage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our approach will strengthen the economy, create more jobs and reduce emissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        National security
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, while we have been fighting COVID, other threats to our national security have not gone away.
       </p>
       <p>
        To keep Australians safe from these threats—whether domestic or foreign—the government is providing an additional $1.9 billion over the decade to strengthen our national security, law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also need to be prepared for a world that is less stable and more contested.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why we are investing $270 billion over 10 years in Australia's defence capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Defence Force continues to protect and uphold our national interests abroad and at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Defence Force are always there for us and we are forever indebted to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, this pandemic is far from over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around the world, there are more than 800,000 new COVID cases every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The global economic environment remains uncertain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The euro area has fallen back into recession.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, Australia is now well on the road to recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our economy is forecast to grow by 1¼ per cent in 2020-21, rising to 4¼ per cent in 2021-22.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment is at a record high, with 75,000 more Australians in jobs than before the pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this budget will help to create more than 250,000 more jobs by the end of 2022-23.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, this budget secures the recovery and sets Australia up for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tax cuts to put more money in people's pockets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business incentives to unleash a further wave of investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        New apprenticeships and training places to get more Australians into work.
       </p>
       <p>
        A $110 billion infrastructure pipeline to build our nation's future.
       </p>
       <p>
        And record funding to guarantee the essential services Australians rely on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, jobs are coming back.
       </p>
       <p>
        The economy is coming back.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is coming back.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this budget will ensure we come back even stronger and ensure that we secure Australia's economic recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the budget to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
