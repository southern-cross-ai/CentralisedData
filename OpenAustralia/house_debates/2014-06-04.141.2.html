       <p>
        As I was saying last night when debating these appropriation bills, I am delighted that, as part of this year's budget, we are going ahead with our community safety program to spend $300,000 on providing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        s in and around Darwin and Palmerston. CCTVs have delivered great benefits where they have been installed. They are invaluable tools in solving and preventing crime. I know that they will be embraced by the Solomon community. We will be enlisting help from the community during the selection process. I am actually in the process now of organising a committee that is made up of police,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        and some business groups to identify key hotspots around Darwin and Palmerston.
       </p>
       <p>
        One really good element of the Safer Streets Program is that we are using money generated from proceeds of crime to tackle crime and the criminals who commit them. Unlike Labor, we deliver on our CCTV rollouts. This is one of a number of things that we have done since we have come to government to assist the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        Police in doing their job to make the streets of Darwin and Palmerston safer. In February immigration minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        visited Darwin to announce that the Commonwealth would spend $48 million to employ around 100 police officers to oversee the asylum seekers still based in the territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my first term of parliament, back in the bad old days of opposition, I worked hard to achieve the best outcomes for Solomon should we win the 2013 election. When the people of Solomon put their faith in me last year for another term in Canberra I had already secured funding from my colleagues here in Canberra. One of the best promises our new government has made—and this one is close to my heart—is for the hospital for the people of Palmerston. I have lived in Palmerston for over 20 years and now my son, Aaron, and his wife, Amy, are raising their baby daughter, Evie, in Palmerston.
       </p>
       <p>
        Providing a state-of-the-art hospital in Palmerston is a very personal wish not just for me but for thousands of others around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        . The $110 million for a hospital in Palmerston is a firm commitment from the Abbott government that they take very seriously developing north Australia. The Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These are important, tangible short-term commitments to the people of the north. We want to back that with a strategic vision that will help to make
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        one of the great contributors to the extraordinary economic developments that we see to our north in our region in China, India and elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia has travelled extensively throughout north Australia. I am proud to say that there was such overwhelming interest in the public hearings in Darwin that our committee has agreed to come back for a second visit in August to ensure that all Territorians get their voice heard in terms of north Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another display of the coalition's commitment to deliver for the people of Darwin and Palmerston is the record amount of spending on roads in the Territory. I welcome the coalition's investment in the Territory with the $90 million regional roads productivity package and the $77 million Northern Territory roads package announced in the federal budget. This comes on top of the $70 million already promised by the Abbott government to duplicate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Brennan_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Tiger Brennan Drive
        </a>
        , which was one of my election promises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget for 2014-15 is part of the government's economic action strategy to invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure which will create jobs, improve safety, reduce travel times and, most importantly, boost economic growth. This is $237 million to improve Territory roads. I worked in opposition and in government to have these important projects funded not just in Solomon but across the entire Northern Territory. The people of Lingiari also deserve increased road funding, even if their member was not effective in his advocacy to get that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout my time in opposition I had the opportunity to advocate for our local sporting clubs and secure funding for a variety of different projects that will get the children and adults in my electorate out and about and participating in sport. We recognise that local sport is an important aspect of the Top End community. Community sports organisations encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both children and adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Jingili
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX" rel="nofollow">
         BMX
        </a>
        Club just last weekend tried out their new all-weather track for the first time. The coalition provided $1.5 million worth of funding to ensure this project was finally delivered. Unfortunately, in true Labor style, the money was promised in 2010 but the Labor government did not action it until four weeks out from an election. I look forward to visiting the new track next month when it will be used in competition for the first time. This is fantastic news for Territory BMX riders, who can now ride all year long and host international standard tournaments and not be disadvantaged by the wet season.
       </p>
       <p>
        Berrimah Riding Club is another great local organisation in my electorate. They will receive around $5,000 to construct a shade structure over their horse wash bays. Not only does this funding benefit Berrimah Riding Club; it also assists other organisations that uses the Robbie Robbins Reserve facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Darwin Rugby League Football Club will receive $99,000 for much-needed upgrades to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Park
        </a>
        , where a majority of the Northern Territory junior rugby league games are held on a Saturday morning. Upgrades to the park will include installation of a demountable for officials, roller door upgrades, construction and installation of removable shade structures, plumbing repairs, irrigation upgrades and field lights.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to this, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Palmerston Football Club
        </a>
        will receive $8,700 toward construction of new locker rooms for players and the Darwin Table Tennis Association will receive $13,000 for the purchase of 15 internationally certified table tennis tables for competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another key election issue in my electorate centred around the coalition's policy to stop the flow of asylum seeker boats into the Northern Territory. I am so pleased to be able to say we have delivered on that promise. We said before the election that we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we have done. That is good governance—carrying out promises made before an election. This is what the coalition is all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted in particular that this policy goal has been so quickly achieved. Overflowing detention centres in the electorate of Solomon meant an added burden on our healthcare system, emergency services and other social infrastructure, which I spoke about many times in this House. Those burdens did not please the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Sadly, people were dying trying to get to our country It was our Navy personnel who were tasked with pulling deceased bodies from the water when people-smuggling vessels sank. The only humane thing to do was to stop the boats. It was the only way to be fair both to Australian taxpayers and to desperate asylum seekers fleeing their countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, we announced that two of the Darwin detention centres would close down. This is a dividend of the coalition's policy to stop the boats. The Defence Establishment Berrimah and the Darwin Airport Lodge will cease operations this financial year. This will directly affect my constituents, with pressure easing on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        and other social infrastructure. As I said, this is just one example of how the coalition is mopping up the mess left behind by the Labor Party and it infuriates me that my constituents must now do all the heavy lifting for the Labor Party's laziness and irresponsible actions. The coalition government's budget is addressing the debt and deficit disaster left behind by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . This Labor Party's legacy is unsustainable and must not be allowed to continue. To fail to tackle the borrowing of $1 billion every month just to pay the interest is unsustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the coalition is used to cleaning up Labor's mess, it does not make it any easier. Nor is it fair on the hardworking Australian taxpayers. When the coalition last left office, Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, but over six years Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits, $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt heading towards $667 billion. The measures outlined in this year's budget are absolutely necessary so that we can secure Australia's economic future, and the tough decisions we are taking now are necessary to avoid even tougher decisions having to be made in the future.

        </small>
        <p>
         I am pleased to speak on this budget, which begins the important task of repairing the Commonwealth budget and delivering a credible pathway back to surplus. Consider where we were in 2007: we had an unemployment rate of four per cent, no government debt, we had budgets in surplus. When the Labor government left office six years later, they left us with 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits and the world's biggest carbon tax. This budget is an important step in fixing up that mess.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we see with repairing the budget is that we have a pathway back to surplus in 2018-19 and budget surpluses to build to well over one per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         by 2024-25. Rather than the debt of $667 billion, which was projected in 2013-14, in 10 years' time the debt will be $389 billion—almost $300 billion less. This decline in debt is equivalent to $10,100 per Australian. By repairing the budget, Australia will have lower debt and lower interest costs. The interest on government debt is projected to be $16 billion lower in a decade, meaning more money for health, education, roads and support for families and seniors.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are two parts of the budget that I would really like to focus on .The first is the infrastructure. The budget will create an $11.6 billion Infrastructure Growth Package. This is important to unlock growth, unlock productivity in our economy and to boost the total infrastructure investment by Commonwealth, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to over $125 billion by the end of this decade—or the equivalent of eight
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
          Snowy Mountains
         </a>
         schemes.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my electorate of Boothby, finally we are going to see work commence on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
          South Road
         </a>
         . The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAA" rel="nofollow">
          RAA
         </a>
         , the key motoring organisation in South Australia, has long had a vision of a north-south road corridor, going from Darlington in the south to Wingfield in the north and connecting with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Expressway" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Expressway
         </a>
         in the south and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Expressway" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Expressway
         </a>
         in the north. So we are finally seeing action on South Road at Darlington. This announcement has been welcomed by my constituents who have expressed their appreciation now that this project is finally going ahead. It is great news for local traffic, and it will create jobs, which will help the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         economy in the future. As a focal point of the federal budget there was an extra $441 million in funding allocated to South Australia for upgrades to South Road, taking the total federal contribution to almost $1 billion and allowing both the Darlington and Torrens to Torrens upgrades to be constructed simultaneously. I want to pay credit to the Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
          Steven Marshall
         </a>
         , who realised, rather than a stand-off between one project and the other, indeed, why not do both.
        </p>
        <p>
         The upgrades at Darlington are what I have been fighting for on behalf my constituents since 2007. These upgrades have been promised since 2006 by the Labor Party who have failed to deliver. In the last seven years Labor have spruiked for South Road at Sturt Road a tunnel, an underpass, a flyover, an interchange and a widening of South Road. None of these projects have been delivered. In this year's budget we are delivering on our election commitment to build the Darlington interchange by funding 80 per cent of the overall project through our Infrastructure Growth Package. The upgrades will mean free-flowing traffic from the end of the Southern Expressway to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daws_Road" rel="nofollow">
          Daws Road
         </a>
         . In addition, the project contains much needed improvement to the Marion Road and Sturt Road intersection. These infrastructure projects will create much needed opportunities for South Australian contractors and will bring our infrastructure into the 21st century. Adelaide, I think, has had the poorest infrastructure of any mainland capital city, but completion of the north-south road corridor should see that rectified.
        </p>
        <p>
         The major South Road upgrades at Darlington are scheduled to be finished by 2018. It is planned to construct a lowered road to the west of South Road that will extend the Southern Expressway free-flowing carriageways to a point north of the South Road-Ayliffes Road intersection. Flinders Drive will be extended to connect through to Sturt Road allowing local traffic to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
          Flinders University
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
          Flinders Medical Centre
         </a>
         to be unimpeded. There will be upgrades to the remaining South Road intersections, that is, connection to the Southern Expressway, Flinders Drive, Sturt Road, Ayliffes Road and the entrance to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsley_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Tonsley Park
         </a>
         . As I said before, the intersection of Marion Road and Sturt Road will be widened, and there is also going to be some work done on South Road through Edwardstown near
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Plaza" rel="nofollow">
          Castle Plaza
         </a>
         to cater for the morning peak-hour traffic. They are looking at an extra northbound lane on South Road. So there will be some widening there. Early works should begin later this year, with heavy roadworks to commence next year. The entire project is to be completed by 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was very pleased to be with the Prime Minister, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure, the member for Mayo, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of South Australia
         </a>
         and the transport minister for South Australia, Stephen Mullighan, touring the Traffic Management Centre in Norwood and having a look at what the project at Darlington will look like. It really is one of the key measures for my electorate and a complete delivery of what we committed to at the election. In addition, there is money for Roads to Recovery funding. South Australian councils will receive twice as much funding. I also encourage local councils to apply for funding under the expanded
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot" rel="nofollow">
          Black Spot
         </a>
         program.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other key measure in the budget that I wanted to talk about was the Medical Research
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         . This is a landmark initiative. It really is a nation-building initiative for the 21st century. Before the election we said one of the key things we would do would be to back our strengths. Medical research is one of the strengths, and it is going to be one of the future drivers for the economy. So to have a capital fund building up to $20 billion will allow an income stream in perpetuity for medical research. It is a significant expansion of medical research funding in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my home state of South Australia the SAHMRI—the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute—is well positioned to capitalise on this. It has been the named 'the cheese grater' or 'the pineapple' and it came about as a result of the

         <i>
          eview of health and medical research in South Australia
         </i>
         which was conducted by Professor John Shine AO and Mr Alan Young AM, who recommended the establishment of a dedicated flagship research institute for South Australia. South Australia being a small state, we had three different universities all competing against each other; but what we really needed was one flagship research institute. With the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Adelaide_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Adelaide Hospital
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
          University of Adelaide
         </a>
         medical school moving to the same precinct, this co-location will build on South Australia's impressive contribution to medical research and innovation.

He said that Lord Florey was possibly the greatest Australian ever for his contribution in developing penicillin for wider use. He also paid tribute to the work of the previous government and spoke of the importance of medical research.

         With the new SAHMRI, South Australia has the potential to develop a biotech precinct in the

         area, in the same way that Parkville in Melbourne is a long established biotech precinct and Brisbane has become one. This is an opportunity to build on our existing strengths—our renowned excellence in research and clinical trials but we need to foster a climate where that can occur. That is why the Medical Research Future Fund is so important. It will see people come to Australia from overseas as a destination of choice to do their postdoctoral research and build their careers in medical research.

         The executive director Steve Wesselingh has already assembled an impressive group of individuals. We have seen people return from overseas, like Professor Prash Sanders, working in the area of heart health, and Dr Charles Mullighan, heading up the research theme in cancer. These are people who could have had a research career anywhere in the world but have chosen to return to Adelaide because of the facilities that are on offer. SAHMRI has established seven research themes: Aboriginal health; cancer; healthy mothers; babies and children; heart health; infection and immunity; mind and brain; and nutrition and metabolism. It will be a significant development in the landscape in South Australia but it is important that we have the Medical Research Future Fund to provide certainty for medical research into the future.

         SAHMRI is building a team of more than 600 outstanding researchers who are working together in the search for better treatments and cures. It is creating a world-class precinct of medical research and clinical application adjacent to the site of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. These are just two of the important developments for my electorate in the budget and we need to have the Medical Research Future Fund adequately funded.

         It is a landmark initiative. I pay credit to the Minister For Health who has long wanted to make medical research a signature of his time as minister. It really builds on the theme that it has been Liberal governments that have been the great friends of medical research in this country. We well remember all the times the previous Treasurer tried to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the medical research budget.

         The Medical Research Future Fund will build to a level of $20 billion; it will then be the largest medical research fund in the world. It will provide income of over $1 billion and it is important, seeing what Labor did with some of these other future funds, that we have a structure like the Future Fund so the Labor Party cannot raid the capital and spend it.

         They are the two initiatives I wanted to speak on. The South Road development will now be underway. I do pay credit to the South Australian government, because they have actually come up with an improved proposal for Darlington. It is improved from what was originally in the Darlington Transport Study, and it will be great news for residents of the south. South Road-Sturt Road has been one of the major bottlenecks and major hold-ups in traffic, so this will be a welcome development by the time it is finished in 2018. Similarly, the Medical Research Future Fund is going to be very important, right across Australia. SAHMRI is a new institution but is well poised to benefit from that fund.
