       <p>
        Recently I had the pleasure of attending two functions organised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thu_Duc" rel="nofollow">
         Thu Duc
        </a>
        Ex-

         Reserve Officers Association
        </a>
        . Since 1987, the association has been working with and on behalf of veterans who graduated from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thu_Duc_Military_Academy" rel="nofollow">
         Thu Duc Military Academy
        </a>
        in Vietnam. I identify with and fully support the values and objectives of this organisation, particularly the values of helping others, defending human rights in Vietnam and engaging in charity activities as well as providing emotional and financial support to former soldiers. I thank the two presidents of the Thu Duc Ex-Reserve Officers Association, Thinh Van Nguyen and Ngoc Quang Pham, for their kind invitation to attend their respective functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year marks the 59th anniversary of the Thu Duc Military Academy, which was established in Vietnam. The Thu Duc academy trained more than 40,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">
         South Vietnamese
        </a>
        army officers to fight for freedom. It produced several thousand officers each year and became the army’s primary source of their small-unit leaders. The officers who trained at the Thu Duc academy learned the values of discipline and respect. They also showed great courage. It is entirely fitting that those officers who now call Australia home are supported and cared for through the good work of the Thu Duc officers association.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note with sadness that many of the officers who trained through the Thu Duc academy would have suffered following the fall of Saigon. Many fled Vietnam with their families in the hope of a better life, and I know that many found their way to Australia and are making a major contribution to our way of life in this country. They have sought to make Australia home and in doing so have contributed amazingly to the fabric of our society, particularly in my electorate of Fowler.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be the role and responsibility of all generations to ensure that our veterans are remembered and honoured. In that context, I value the work of the Thu Duc Ex-Reserve Officers Association, who ensure that their members—those who graduated from the Thu Duc Military Academy—and all South Vietnamese soldiers who fled following the fall of Saigon are not forgotten. They maintain their position in terms of democracy and freedom for Vietnam; indeed, they work tirelessly in support of human rights in that region. I thank the Thu Duc Ex-Reserve Officers Association for their role and for embracing me as the member for Fowler.
