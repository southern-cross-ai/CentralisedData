       <p>
        I rise today in this chamber to pay tribute to the families, the relatives and the friends of those servicemen who served on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        . This weekend marks the 65th anniversary of the sinking of the
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , and families will meet to commemorate that in Melbourne in Newport on Sunday. I have spoken before in the House of HMAS
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        . The story and the history of that ship are very much part of the fabric of Australia’s massive contribution in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        —a massive contribution by the Navy. The
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        , which was sunk on 4 March 1942, typifies so much of the sacrifice that those who served in the Navy and the other forces experienced during World War II.
       </p>
       <p>
        The historian Daniel Oakman, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         War Memorial
        </a>
        , has written of the history of the HMAS
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        . It is a story of incredible sacrifice. I came to know of it because a constituent in my electorate, Mr Garry Taylor, is a relative of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Taylor
        </a>
        , known as ‘Buck’, who served on the
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        and died during combat. I spoke of this some years ago, and the families who survive to pass on the stories of the
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        very much want to have the contribution recognised in a major way. I will read quickly from some of Oakman’s history, where he talks about the great courage of those on board who, ‘in a firefight with the Japanese, saw the ship sink’. There was ‘an abandon ship call, but the
        <i>
         Yarra
        </i>
        kept on firing’, and history records Ron Taylor’s very courageous efforts as the last man, manning the last operational gun on that day. Many died. Some survived for a short period of time but died in the water, and others managed to be rescued later on. This Sunday marks a very important chapter in Australia’s history that all of us in this House would do well to remember as part of Australia’s massive contribution in World War II.
