        , a much loved man with a zest for life, who reminded all Canberrans 'to enjoy the good times'. Jim was a man who was a passionate about his Catholic faith, passionate about helping people, passionate about the Canberra community and passionate about his sport. He made an enormous contribution to the Canberra community through his work with local charities, particularly his tireless support of Open Family, a charity aimed at helping to improve the lives of homeless people. A successful businessman, Jim spent 30 years building his business from humble beginnings, distributing wine from a shed. As a result, he was a strong supporter of local business and spent five years as chairman of CanTrade, working to bring business to the
