        I rise to pay tribute to the exceptional work of Father Norman Gray, who recently celebrated 50 years of Anglican priesthood in my electorate of Gorton. Father Gray of Delahey worked tirelessly over the last five decades helping and providing support for the disadvantaged, the needy and the marginalised. After devoting two decades to remote Aboriginal communities and Scout and Rotary movements in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Father Gray has spent the last three helping communities in western Melbourne. Father Gray’s altruism and concern for others have brought him into many different settings, including schools, parishes, psychiatric facilities and even prisons. Last month Father Gray celebrated his 50-year milestone at a gathering with friends, family and representatives from state and federal governments. This ceremony included the renewal of Father Gray’s ordination vows and song performances by the Hume Anglican Grammar School choir and the Essendon Baptist musicians and singers.

        Fifty years of services is no small feat. This achievement is a testament to Father Gray’s dedication and humanity. At the age of 74, Father Gray remains an energetic and dynamic member of and contributor to his community. He is still active in his church and sits on a range of local community committees, including the Delahey Residents Association and the school council for

        . It is as inspiring as it is uplifting to hear local stories of charity and generosity such as those of Father Gray. The compassionate causes for which he works are extremely admirable, and he should feel extremely proud of his body of work over so many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the achievements of Father Gray but also recognise the efforts and support provided by his family and many friends. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Father Gray’s wife, Margaret, and his four children, Christopher and

        , Wendy Vella and Helen Catterall. Father Gray’s efforts deserve acknowledgement, but he is not one to seek praise or recognition. He is driven, it would seem, by the passionate desire to help those around him and the cause of realising social justice. Father Gray is an inspiration and a fine community leader, and the community of western Melbourne is indeed indebted to him. It is a privilege to be associated with Father Gray—a wonderful constituent of my electorate.
