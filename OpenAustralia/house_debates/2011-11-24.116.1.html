        I take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Jenkins
        </a>
        , the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House of Representatives
        </a>
        . All his life, Harry has been totally dedicated to the principles of democracy, and he has brought humour, integrity and a fair approach to the role of Speaker. Harry has the respect of and is held in high regard by not only members on this side or members on the other side but also, I think, all the staff in this parliament. Harry has been a friend to us all. He has acted as a mentor to most members of parliament. He is always there to talk through issues when you need to. He has exasperated me and made me angry when he has been in the Speaker's chair, and I think that shows what a great Speaker he was. He really delivered to the parliament by being bipartisan in the way he fulfilled his role as Speaker. Harry would have to be one of the people I hold in the highest esteem within this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank him publicly for what he has done for this parliament, what he has done for our country and what he has done for democracy. I know that he will continue to make enormous contributions and will still have that wonderful sense of humour. He will still be a friend to us all and be the unique Harry Jenkinsâ€”a very special person who has established a place for himself in history because of the way he was able to conduct himself and what he brought to this parliament as Speaker. Thank you, Harry. I say that on behalf of all members of this House.

         I thank the honourable member for Shortland. As Deputy Speaker, I endorse the remarks made by the honourable member. Mr Speaker Jenkins and I have had a very good working relationship, and he has my greatest admiration.
