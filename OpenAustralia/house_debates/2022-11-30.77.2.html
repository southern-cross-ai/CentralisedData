         I thank the member for Lyons for his question, a man who has to work with 12 local government areas in his electorate. As a former regional mayor I know the importance of working with all levels of government, to make sure that you can deliver the services your communities rely on. The local government sector is a trusted delivery partner for the federal government. They are the only level of government who deliver services to every town, village and community across this country. As a government we know how important the sector is, which is why we have brought local government back to the table of National Cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
         We rely on councils to deliver services on behalf of the federal government, whether that's disaster recovery, whether it's aged care, whether it's Closing the Gap initiatives or other community services. We know, if we're going to rely on them, we have to give them a seat at the table and listen to them. We are also bringing back the

         in 2023, 546 local government areas across this country, bringing them here to speak directly with the Prime Minister, with cabinet ministers, with ministers and the government, on how our priorities and their programs can be delivered best into communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         On top of that, this week they held the first local government ministers meeting of the Albanese government. We discussed critical issues, local government sustainability, housing, critical shortages in skilled workforces and their own capability. We know local governments across Australia deserve broad-sweeping policy, policy that delivers and meets the needs of communities across this country, and we will ensure that their voices continue to be heard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local governments across the country will benefit from all of our policies, whether it's increased jobs in the renewable energy sector, access to secure housing, better connectivity or helping them deliver their locally-led solutions. We are continuing to provide financial support for local councils so they can fix roads, upgrade facilities and provide essential services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's not forget it was the Whitlam government that introduced financial assistance grants—$64 billion delivered into the sector since that time. In 2022-23, this government is committed to delivering $2.9 billion in financial assistance grants to local governments across the country. We've also committed $750 million in local roads and community infrastructure—

           an increase of $250 million on what those opposite committed, because we know how important local roads are to our communities. We know this untied funding enables local governments to deliver their community priorities and enables the best place based solutions to come through. I know firsthand how important funding is, and I've met with over 170 councils who reiterate that they want to work with a federal government that wants to help them deliver for their communities.
