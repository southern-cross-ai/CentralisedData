       <p>
        Reid has very long, historic and proud ties to the veteran community. Last Friday, I attended the official opening of Fussell House at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_Repatriation_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Concord Repatriation General Hospital
        </a>
        , in my electorate. Fussell House provides a non-clinical place for veterans to stay together and share experiences in a relaxed environment while receiving support and treatment at the National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare. The National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare is a world-class facility, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government should be commended for the significant investment in the future wellbeing of veterans and their families in this state.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new facility, Fussell House, is named after Lieutenant Michael Fussell, who was serving with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Task_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Special Operations Task Force
        </a>
        in Afghanistan when he was tragically killed in action by an improvised explosive device. It was a privilege to have his parents, Ken and Madeline Fussell, at the opening. Their son gave our country his life for our freedom, and, on behalf of all Australians, I say we are eternally grateful.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        provided $6.7 million to develop the Fussell House accommodation facility, which forms part of the world-class National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare at the Concord Hospital. The 19-room facility will especially benefit those from regional and rural areas when veterans are getting treatment. It will also allow families to stay with the veterans as they are receiving treatment—which is very important, because family support is critical to recovery. We know that veterans overwhelmingly prefer to have their family close at hand and involved in their treatment and care, and that is why this new facility is just so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Centre for Veterans' Healthcare has multiple specialists in one location, working as a multidisciplinary team. The specialists combine with the patient and their family, carers and primary healthcare providers to create one collaborative treatment team. Further enhancing the care provided to veterans and their families, the centre has established links with community support organisations, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Arms" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —Veterans &amp; Families Counselling as well as local educational facilities and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_On" rel="nofollow">
         Soldier On
        </a>
        in the development of this community. Mr Ivan Slavich, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Soldier On, provided crucial support for the family, and the Soldier On charity continues to provide critical support to services for our veteran community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fitting that my electorate of Reid is the location for this magnificent facility. From the Burwood War Memorial Arch, to Concord Hospital's historical ties to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        , to the

        in Rhodes, Reid is the very proud home of the veteran community. While we can never fully repay the debt we owe to Lieutenant Fussell, I am pleased that we can continue to honour his memory and his sacrifice for our nation through his ongoing legacy.
