        It has been an exciting time in my electorate of Kingston over the last few weeks. I have attended the openings of a number of important local projects that will improve the southern Adelaide region significantly. It is important to note that all of these projects have been funded by this Labor government, and many of them are projects that I have committed to in my community and have now delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to talk about the opening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        Super Clinic at Noarlunga. In 2007 I knew that local health services were important to my local area. I was very pleased with the big response to my petition calling for a GP Super Clinic in the local area. With the contribution of $12 million from the state government and $12 million from the federal government, I was pleased to join the federal and state ministers for health to open the $25 million GP Super Clinic at Noarlunga. This will offer a huge range of services in my electorate—things that have often been difficult to get—after-hours GPs, psychologists, podiatrists, specialists in early childhood and family support, to name just a few. This GP Super Clinic sits alongside the headspace site which, I am informed by its operators, has generated considerable interest and attendance which will deliver important mental health care services to young people in the electorate.

        On this weekend I am very pleased that I will be joined by both the state and federal transport ministers to open the rail bridge that is part of the Noarlunga to Seaford rail line. The community had called for this important project for over 30 years and it is now one step closer to completion. It is the longest rail bridge in the country. It is 0.1 kilometres longer than the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour Bridge
        </a>
        . This important piece of infrastructure has been wholly funded by the federal government, and is delivering something that the residents in Kingston for the last 30 years have needed. I look forward to the completion of the tracks, which will coincide with the electrification of the existing line to provide an excellent service to the southern suburbs of Adelaide.
       </p>

        I also attended the opening of the trade training centre at Southern Vales Christian College. It was my pleasure to open this important centre. Of course, this was a commitment made by Labor in 2007 to deliver trade training to high schools, which we now see this at the college's Aldinga campus, as with many other schools in my electorate. This $1.5 million project is an important project that delivers certificate I and

        courses in hospitality to secondary students. They get credit for their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACE" rel="nofollow">

        —their year 11 and 12—and also learn some important life skills, transitioning themselves to a life of employment. I think this is really exciting. Not only is the centre really important to the school, it adds to the philosophy of the school, which is to encourage a love of agriculture and a love of cooking—as they put it, paddock to plate. This is an important investment funded by this federal Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project that I was pleased to be at the opening of is the d'Arenberg Stables Wine Immersion Centre. This was funded under the tourism quality grants program, which the Labor government has put money into. The opening of an interactive display at d'Arenberg winery was very important. I would highly recommend d'Arenberg wine to those in the House who have not tried it before. It is a very good wine from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        region. The centre connects people with the product. There is a wonderful interactive display and a blending bench. If you go there you can make your own wine by blending a number of different wines together. It is a wonderful project that the federal government has contributed to, dollar for dollar, in partnership with the local tourism association.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have also been openings of a number of projects under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program delivered by the federal government. Those projects and the ones I have mentioned have improved local community infrastructure in a range of ways and are examples of how this federal government is committed to local communities.
