        On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         Safekeeping: inquiry into the biosecurity of Australian honey bees
        </i>
        together with minutes of proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        Honey bees provide critical environmental and economic benefits to Australia, particularly to the agricultural industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The economic value of honey and other hive products produced by managed honey bees in Australia is estimated at $100 million per year, but the pollination services they provide to the agricultural industry are estimated to be worth $4 billion per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the honey bee industry is facing increasing threat from invasive pests and diseases arriving into Australia from overseas. Historically, Australia's physical isolation has enabled it to remain free of many pests and diseases. With growing trade links and international travel, the risk of pests and diseases has increased. The Australian honey bee industry is not immune to these risks and faces a range of biosecurity threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of this, the committee conducted a roundtable to understand the biosecurity threats facing the Australian beekeeping industry, and assess government risk management and response strategies. The roundtable was attended by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        , the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council and Plant Health Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee found that the varroa mites are of particular threat to honey bees and have spread to every beekeeping country in the world except Australia. An infestation of varroa mites, particularly
        <i>
         Varroa destructor
        </i>
        , can have catastrophic consequences on honey bees, culminating in colony breakdown and collapse of hives. The committee praises the collaborative approach being undertaken against the threat of varroa mites.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the committee found that, while Australian biosecurity controls have so far been successful, there are ongoing risks. It is essential that early detection and response capabilities be increased to prevent a potentially devastating impact on the Australian economy. Therefore, the committee makes six recommendations aimed at improving early threat detection and response strategies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Bee Pest Surveillance Program is considered to be the first line of defence against bee pests and diseases arriving into Australia. The program operates at key entry points around the country and provides a risk-based early warning system for the entry of bee pests and pest bees. The initial program, Model 1, was established in 2013, and at an annual cost of approximately $669,000. It allowed for the coverage of 39 ports, 167 sentinel hives, 129 standard catch boxes, 20 remote catch boxes and 11 floral sweeping locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Model 1 was superseded by the Model 2 program in December last year, at an annual cost of approximately $920,000, and will continue until 2021. Model 2 sees a substantial increase in efforts to monitor the entry of pest bees, covering 14 high-risk ports. These ports account for 95 per cent of the total trade imports into Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the proposed Model 3 program would see a significant increase in effective coverage across the country. It would effectively double the funding for the program and substantially increase port coverage from 32 to 54. The number of sentinel hives would increase from 174 to 278. The number of standard catch boxes would be slightly reduced; however, the number of remote catch boxes would be increased considerably from 40 to 210. The Asian honey bee catch boxes would increase by 30 per cent, and floral sweeping efforts would be doubled. The annual cost would be approximately $1.9 million. The cost is comparatively small, given its protection of a $100 million beekeeping industry and the pollination services provided to a $4 billion agricultural industry. The value of this cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the committee recommends that the proposed Model 3 program be implemented by 30 June 2017. The committee further recommends: investigating the use of technology to greater enable public involvement in detection programs; analysing pest bee risk ratings at all Australian ports; commencing an analysis of bee smuggling into Australia; and undertaking research and development into selective breeding of honey bees for resistance against Varroa mite and diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all who have contributed their valuable time and wisdom to this inquiry. My special thanks go to committee secretary Dr Anna Dacre, inquiry secretary Anthony Overs and researcher Peter Pullen. Their professionalism and attention to detail are highly valued by myself and, I know, the deputy chair, who is here today. Their work provides great assistance to me as the chair and to all committee members. Thank you.

I, too, would like to second the thanks offered by the chair to Dr Anna Dacre, Anthony Overs, Peter Pullen,

         and Jessica Hargreaves.
        </p>
        <p>
         As deputy chair, it was a learning experience and, indeed, an incredible experience to learn that the Australian honey bee is so important to Australia. The value of honey and other hive products produced by managed honey bees in Australia is comparatively small at an estimated $100 million a year. But honey bees make an enormous indirect contribution to our economy through the pollination services that they provide. Many fruit, nut, vegetable, legume and seed crops cannot bear fruit or seeds without being pollinated. And although we do have a range of insects doing the job of pollinating the plants, the honey bee plays the most important role. Therefore, we must protect it. Honey bees pollinate many horticultural crops, as well, and boost the grazing industry by improving yield of common fodder crops like clover and lucerne. So the real value of the honey bee to Australia is estimated to be $4 billion. They are busy little bees indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
         We are fortunate in Australia that our honey bees remain healthy, and this is due in part to our isolation—that is true.

        <p>
         That was not our remit, the member for Kennedy might like to know. But we, perhaps, can look at that in the future. It is also due to the vigilance of our biosecurity measures, which have proved both important and successful to date. However, the risk of invasive pests or diseases arriving in Australia has increased because of growing trade links with the rest of the world and increasing international travel.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are risks to the honey bee from invasive species such as the Asian honey bee, which has become established in northern Queensland, and a range of pest. But the biggest risk comes from the Varroa mite. The aptly named Verroa destructor species has spread to every beekeeping country in the world except Australia, and we must remain vigilant to keep it at bay. If the destructor mite does make it to Australia, it will be a serious threat not just to beekeeping and honey production but to horticultural and agricultural industries, as well. It would likely would likely wipe out entirely our feral honey bee population and make it much harder to safely operate managed hives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of the Varroa destructor mite making it to Australia is deemed as high, with three to four pest bees found at our borders each year. While our biosecurity controls are focused on our borders, there is an additional risk that the mite could arrive on bees that have been smuggled into Australia. There have been two cases prosecuted in Australia for smuggling of bees, so it is not unheard of. Australia does have in place a strong suite of biosecurity protections based on a risk-based framework, meaning that resources and efforts are concentrated at points where risks are considered to be the greatest. All vessels and cargo imported must be reported and profiled for risk. Vessels of concern may be inspected and sent for mandatory treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Bee Pest Surveillance Program is targeted at ports of entry, with sentinel hives, lures and traps. Information is shared between government and industry, and the public has a role to play, as well. Sentinel hives and catchboxes are placed at high-risk locations at ports and monitored for invasive species and bee pests. This collaborative approach is vitally important.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to see that the committee has accepted my recommendation that the government investigate the development of an easy-to-use smartphone app which may help members of the public to more easily contribute to the eradication program. The committee also recommends the government complete the analysis of pest bee risk ratings for ports where it is not complete, and that assessment should include airports and pre-embarkation inspections. Also, a detailed analysis must be undertaken of the smuggling of bees into Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This report is aptly named
         <i>
          Safe keeping
         </i>
         . This committee will keep a very close eye on the health of the Australian honey bee.
