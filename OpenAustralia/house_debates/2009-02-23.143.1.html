        , and we, as federal members of parliament, were invited to listen to their rehearsal and then meet with the orchestra members from our electorates. I was greatly impressed during the 20 minutes that I listened to the orchestra—the music was pure, clear and exhilarating. Although the conductor, 28-year-old

        , pulled the orchestra up on a few occasions, I recall it was the best orchestra that I have ever listened to.

        I am also proud to say that Cowan was very well represented, with three musicians as part of the orchestra. Sara Herriman of Kingsley was on violin, and I know that her parents, Bruce and Amanda, are very proud of the dedication Sarah has shown to get to this place in her art. I know that Sarah has also been greatly influenced by her teacher, Margaret Blades. In the percussion section Cowan was represented by Natasha French of

        . Natasha attributes her success to the commitment of her teacher,

        . I am sure that Tim, and Natasha’s parents, Allan and

        , are proud of what she has achieved and what she will do in the future. Also in the percussion section was Catherine Betts of Greenwood. Her parents are Wayne and Diana Betts and her sister is Candice. I know that they have always been out there supporting Catherine in her achievements.

        It is important to say that it is very difficult to get into this orchestra. It has taken these young musicians years of dedication and self-sacrifice to achieve the extraordinary skill required. They have done so with the support of teachers and family members. I do not know where their futures will take them but I am confident that if it is in music or elsewhere, the outstanding commitment shown so far will guarantee them success.
