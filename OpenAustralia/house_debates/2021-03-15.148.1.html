        In every regional community you will find several people who might be described as community leaders, people who go above and beyond what might be expected of them, people who work tirelessly in the interests of their local community. Singleton's Di Sneddon is one of those people, and I was pleased to learn last week that she'd become the Upper Hunter New South Wales Woman of the Year. It's not Di's first awardâ€”far from it! In fact, in 2013 she was named Singleton's Citizen of the Year. Di is involved in just about everything. Everywhere I go in support of a good cause, Di is there too. There are many examples, but her work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        , where she has been the recipient of a Humanitarian Partner Award, stands out. But Di is possibly best known for her many years at
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         Singleton Argus
        </i>
        , where she first worked after leaving high school in 1980. Yes, Di is a fully-fledged local! Di went on to become a long-serving editor of
        <i>
         The Singleton Argus
        </i>
        . There can be no doubt Di was not fully remunerated for the hours she dedicated to her role there. Both as a journalist and editor, Di used her position for the common good. She didn't just report on and oversee the news; she helped shape it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her work with the Red Cross and newspaper came together in 1999 when the government decided Singleton's army camp would become host to 500 displaced people from war-torn Kosovo. Di was quick to realise that the men, women and children being given safe haven would need the support of the local community and that it would be important to ensure the community had all the facts. Di knew that misinformation or even a dearth of information would fuel community suspicion of and opposition to the safe-haven arrangement. She fought for special access to the camp for her local newspaper to ensure all the facts were known in the community and to foster local sympathy and support for the refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Di's efforts met with spectacular success and history now records how warmly the Kosovo people were received in the local community and, indeed, how generous Singleton residents were toward them. They donated toys and other goods and volunteered to provide English lessons. Local sporting clubs organised coaching clinics for the new arrivals and local musicians provided entertainment. The responsive residents made us all proud. The pride of the Kosovo people brought the best out in all of us. Di Sneddon made sure the community response was the right response. Without her leadership it could have been a different one. Misinformation causes both suspicion and anger. Again showing great courage, Di recently became part of a new community newspaper venture where she continues to lead and shape community attitudes. Di Sneddon is a local legend and is deserving of every accolade and award she has received. Congratulations on the latest recognition, Di. I'm proud to count you as a friend.
