        The Centenary of Anzac 2014-18 is one of the most important commemorative periods in Australia's history. This year
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        marked 100 years since the Armistice of the

        . I was privileged to support community groups to commemorate this solemn anniversary through the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. The program allowed grants for community based projects and activities to commemorate the end of the First World War, to remember Australian service men and women from all conflicts and to reflect on a just and secure peace. I was pleased to bring together local

        Our community honours and remembers the great sacrifice made by all Australian service men and women throughout our country's history and in particular those from the Central Coast. We'll remember the solemn sacrifice that played such a formative role in shaping our nation's identity. On Remembrance Day I was with community members of the Toukley RSL Sub-branch and earlier with the Tuggerah Lakes Nashos. We heard from local teenager Mia Thomas, whose great-great-grandfather Captain Alfred Shout was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        enlisted in 1915 and saw combat at Gallipoli. He was promoted to lance corporal and, whilst serving in France in the 2nd Australian Pioneer Battalion, he was awarded the military medal for conspicuous bravery for assisting wounded troops under heavy fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the people of the Central Coast I would like to acknowledge and support the work done by community groups, the RSL sub-branches and the National Servicemen's Association in their care for all returned service men and women, who have given their all to Australia at home and abroad in all conflicts and peacekeeping operations. I conclude by thanking all the community groups, the RSL sub-branches and the National Servicemen's Association for their contribution to the commemorations on the Central Coast.
