        Affordable, accessible health care has been an important part of quality of life for Australians since it was introduced by

         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        and then reformed into Medicare by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        —two iconic Labor leaders. The Strengthening Medicare measures announced in last night's budget start the reform to make Medicare fit for purpose for today's Australia. We are investing a record $3.5 billion over five years to address the sharp decline we've seen in recent times in bulk-billing. We're tripling the bulk-billing incentive for children, pensioners and Commonwealth concession cardholders, including senior cardholders, and benefiting 74,000 people in my home electorate of Boothby. This includes telehealth and videoconference appointments. We're also delivering cheaper medicines for more than six million Australians who need ongoing regular medicine. Our changes to allow for 60-day dispensing will mean cheaper, more accessible medicines for more than 44,000 people in Boothby. This has already been introduced in countries such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , Canada, France, Germany and more, where it led to around a 20 per cent increase in medication compliance because people could afford to buy all of their medicines. I'd like to congratulate the Treasurer,

         There was a bit for people on welfare in last night's budget, but there was nothing for working families in last night's budget. Those families struggling with the costs of living, those families struggling with higher power prices, those families struggling with higher mortgage costs—there was nothing in the budget for them. The only thing that was in the budget for them was higher inflation and higher costs of living for longer under this Labor government. The other thing that was also in there, just to ensure that the cost-of-living crisis would continue, was a truckie tax. What arrives at someone's house without going on a truck first? That tax is going to stay. That cost is going to remain high. There go higher food costs as well!
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing that was very disappointing in last night's budget was the lack of infrastructure spending. One of the greatest disappointments, though obviously not important for any Labor MPs, was with the Stronger Communities Program. What a great program that is—$10,000 or $15,000 grants for sporting clubs, community organisations and groups in the community. We'll be telling everyone that the Labor MPs over there voted to get rid of that really important local community program. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is very important to local councils. Again, we'll be telling everyone that Labor abolished the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program too.

          Until the last 10 seconds, those opposite did nothing to lift the wages of working people. In this budget, we spend $11 billion to say thank you to the hardworking people who work in our aged care with the pay rise that they deserve.
