        . Parliament will not be sitting at the time, so, even though I am a little early, I would like now to send my best wishes to everyone celebrating Chinese New Year, the

         Year of the Rooster
        </a>
        . The rooster is the 10th sign in the Chinese zodiac and represents resourcefulness and confidence. Chinese New Year is celebrated around the world and throughout Australia. Celebrations include decorations such as flowers, red and gold symbols of good luck, and oranges or mandarins as a sign of luck and prosperity. In addition to decorations, people give each other and children a red envelope which contains money or a gift. Red symbolises happiness, luck, prosperity and success. It is a great time of the year, and the festivals, markets and activities are something enjoyed by the entire community, not only Australians with Chinese background.

        In recent years I have enjoyed walking along Beamish Street, Campsie, with lion dancers, while the drumbeat sounds a call to celebrate, and sharing fortune cookies in red envelopes with people of every background. Modern multicultural Australia should give us the opportunity to come together and celebrate every occasion with joy rather than avoid cultural or religious references out of fear. In this spirit, I take great pleasure in wishing every all the best for Chinese New Year, the Year of the Rooster.

        Tet festival, or Vietnamese Lunar New Year, is a wonderful time of year in the Vietnamese community. People return to their home towns, families reunite, friends wish each other well, and the community takes a moment to remember and pay respect to ancestors. Just as the Vietnamese community will use this holiday for reflection, they will also use it to turn a fresh leaf for the new year. Whether it is the kids wearing their new clothes, the adults settling debts and arguments, or the family cleansing the house of bad luck, it is a chance to start afresh. The sound and colour of Tet festival celebrations can be shared by all. I also understand that in Sydney during Tet festival there will be a Guinness world record attempt to gather the most people in one place wearing the Vietnamese non la, the signature conical hat.

        Modern multicultural Australia should give us this opportunity to celebrate and share every occasion with joy rather than avoid religious or cultural references out of fear. We are lucky to study, live and work alongside Vietnamese Australians, many of whom only came here a generation or two ago with the clothes on their backs but managed to contribute so much so quickly to Australia. As we approach the Year of the Rooster, there will be a chance to take a well-deserved break. In this spirit, I take immense pleasure in wishing everyone a happy
