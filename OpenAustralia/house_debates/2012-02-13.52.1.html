       <p>
        I rise to speak for the motorists of the electorate of Hughes, who last week were slugged overnight when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
         LPG
        </a>
        prices jumped 12c, or almost 20 per cent. Yesterday, we had an analysis released by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Automobile Association
        </a>
        showing motorists had been short changed by the so-called shopper docket discounts offered by the supermarket duopoly and that these discounts are nothing more than a big con. The analysis showed that motorists are paying more for petrol because of the duopoly, which has jacked up pump prices to cover a phoney fuel discount voucher. It also found that motorists are paying a higher price for fuel in the fuel cycle today compared with the fuel cycle of the 8c-a-litre discount before Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The newly appointed chairman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Retailers who overstate or misrepresent the value of savings offered to consumers during special sales or promotions risk financial penalties or court action by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The ACCC has set the dogs on many small businesses which have unintentionally misrepresented discounts. Where is the ACCC's $330,000-a-year petrol commissioner, who, since his appointment, has been an apologist for the supermarket duopoly? It is about time the ACCC woke upâ€”these so-called fuel discounts are a con. There is no free lunch. They are simply a misleading anticompetitive tool designed by the supermarket duopoly to destroy competition and jack up prices.
