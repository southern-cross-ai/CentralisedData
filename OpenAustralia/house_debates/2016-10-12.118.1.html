        As I was saying earlier, a free vote on marriage equality could be held in this House this week. It will make a world of difference to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
         LGBTI
        </a>
        Q people who would like to get married and will give young people the ability to imagine a world in which they can do so. We already know that this debate will have a negative effect on gay and lesbian young people—we have heard their stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a very useful case study in Ireland. Just a few days ago research was published by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        showing that the Irish referendum and the increase in homophobic rhetoric had a detrimental effect on young people. Some were forced out of their schools and churches, and communities were unnecessarily divided. In all those joyous images of the successful campaign in Ireland it is easy to forget the hurt that was caused. In fact, we know that the national suicide hotline right here in Australia is already preparing for an increase in calls, having added an entirely new category of calls to its computer system.

        groups have been clear. They have been clear and we have listened to them, unlike the conservatives. A federal election at some point, a plebiscite and a referendum on recognition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is the way that people are talking. I am seriously concerned that this government's planned plebiscite will sap the political will for the referendum campaign and see this historic opportunity missed. Other speakers, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have made that point. Referenda are difficult and I am concerned that this plebiscite, with an aggressive campaign, will see people disengage from our democratic process, putting at risk our chance to change the Constitution to recognise First Peoples. Changing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage Act
        </a>
        does not need a public vote. The Marriage Act was changed by the Howard government by an act of parliament, and that should be the case here as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have to be honest about a few things in this debate. We have to be honest that we have been here before. We have to be honest that on the eve of every single major debate about the rights of every minority group we see very ugly campaigns mounted, and we are seeing this one gather strength. In New South Wales I was the Minister for Family and Community Services. I helped lead Labor's efforts to see Clover Moore's bill to legalise same-sex adoption passed—we did it by about three votes. Much like this debate, it was hard-fought and difficult. Many people said some very hurtful things. But for all the doomsday predictions of those opposed to the legislation, and some of the abhorrent accusations made six years on, I can report to the House that this legislation has actually given homes to many children in foster care—loving homes, supportive homes of people in gay relationships. Parents continue to love their children all the same, but those in same-sex relationships got the recognition they deserved and the support they needed. In fact, for people in heterosexual relationships this legislation did nothing, but it meant the world to some in the LGBTI community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to reiterate a point that has already been made. I can see this campaign clearly. I can see those opposed to equal marriage link this to be safe schools programs, and in some communities it will become very ugly. But I join with my Labor Party colleagues in standing strong with the LGBTI community. I stand strong in looking at what is happening internationally. I stand strong with the majority of Australian people who believe this legislation should happen. I stand strong with many people who have been in gay relationships for their entire lives—30, 40, 50 or 60 years—and I pay respect to those relationships and recognise that they are as legitimate as any other relationship in this country. That legitimisation, the last part of the jigsaw puzzle that needs to be put in place for this wonderful community, is the capacity to be able to marry and demonstrate their love, just like the rest of the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        How can we as a nation stand tall when we still have this sort of discrimination? How can we as a nation stand tall when we are seeing a government simply putting off this inevitable thing in Australia where there is equal marriage for all—where a government that says they want a plebiscite and yet does not bind their members to the outcome of that plebiscite? We know within this government that there will be those who will run part of the 'no' campaign. But let's get marriage equality into legislation. If those opposite cannot think of something better to spend $200 million on, I suggest they go for a walk through their electorates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I implore the House, do not support this unnecessary plebiscite and write the fringe-dwelling bigots a cheque for millions and millions of dollars. I note yesterday the wonderful speech given by the member for Longman and the way in which she expressed her love for her son. And I express the love for my son, as well. We all do on this side of the House. Our deepest thanks go to the LGBTI community for the time, patience and goodwill they have shown this party in terms of explaining to us what they want. They have clearly said they do not want a plebiscite. If it means waiting another few years, that is what they want to do. They want their relationships respected and they want the same rights as everyone else in the Australian community when it comes to equal marriage.
