        , who died on 29 September, the former member for the electorate of Lowe. I thank

         Michael Easson
        </a>
        for allowing me to read his obituary of Michael Maher in this place, in his honour:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Michael John Bernard Maher, politician and solicitor, was greatly admired across the political spectrum as a diligent, local MP who saw the vocation of politics in pastoral terms, as serving the people. Thus the manifold representation of his constituents was no mere chore to be endured and given minimum attention so as to play in the great game of politics. For Maher, high politics was ancillary to the essential, noble tasks of representing the public. He was a model, modest member—but never to be under-estimated because of that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Maher was born on July 11, 1936 in Haberfield to a staunch

        , Labor voting family, the son of Denis (Clem) Maher and Marie O’Connor. He joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        at 15. After leaving school he joined the public service and studied part time. This was in the 1960s when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney University
        </a>
        ensured staff and resources were readily available to working students undertaking a first degree. He graduated in Law in 1965, along the way defeating Bronwyn Setright (now Bishop) in student elections. … He later completed an Arts degree and a Masters in History.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Michael was always interested in politics, with several relatives who were politicians, including cousin

         Ray Maher

        (1911-1966) who unsuccessfully stood for Drummoyne in the 1930s, and who was an MP for several other seats from 1959-1965, and uncle
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Jackson" rel="nofollow">

        (1895-1964) MP for Drummoyne from 1953-56.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After a close contest against aspiring Liberal John Howard in 1968,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Coady" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Coady
        </a>
        , the Labor State member for Drummoyne entertained retirement. But he wanted Maher to succeed him. He held on at the 1971 election and then, before the 1973 contest, aged 37, Maher stood and, despite a statewide swing against Labor, won by 378 votes; Maher subsequently achieved an astonishing two-thirds of the primary vote in several subsequent State elections, known as the Wranslides.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At his side was the Irish-born and educated Dr Margaret Bermingham, a gentle, sharply intelligent, good-humoured, common sense soul, lecturer in

        , whom he married in 1971. They were to have five children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an MP, bureaucrats and politicians were astonished at Maher’s relentless pursuit of cases on behalf of his constituents. Seeking consumer protection laws for people ripped off by dodgy insurance agents, supporting migrants settling in Australia, pursuing housing for impoverished pensioners, pouring his soul into winning small victories for people set upon by the system was an immensely time-consuming effort. Most days, even when Parliament wasn’t sitting, Maher would pop into his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Street
        </a>
        offices to get correspondence typed up by the Parliamentary pool. Transport Minister Peter Cox called him the Minister for Bus Stops as he was always pushing route changes and extra stops on the public transport that he himself assiduously utilised. He enjoyed the company of the many Italian, Maltese, Greek and other communities in his electorate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the former Prime Minister Billy McMahon retired from public life in 1982, a by-election loomed for his federal seat and Maher was persuaded to give up his now decidedly safe seat for the federal electorate of Lowe. Maher achieved a big 9% swing to capture this previously safe Liberal seat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After winning again in the 1983 and 1984 elections, a torrid campaign in 1987 saw Maher narrowly defeated.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Keating
        </a>
        lamented that a man of such talent had not been a Minister. But Maher was never to return to public life. Instead, as a solicitor, he served his clients with characteristic relentless dedication to solve their problems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In political life, Maher saw his greatest achievements in micro terms. Politics was local and personal. But he also played an immense role in co-drafting the Heritage Act in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and ensuring that Labor modernised; his preference vote secured the election of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Wran" rel="nofollow">
         Neville Wran
        </a>
        as NSW Labor Leader in 1973. … Maher had a streak of independence and voted with his conscience on many issues in internal and public debates. He got seriously involved in policy development; aboriginal affairs and civil liberties were passions. He had a Pope Francis-like insight into what was important between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_and_Church" rel="nofollow">
         State and Church
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For a long time, Maher was struck by Parkinson’s Disease which over a decade left him terribly debilitated; his wife Margaret was constantly devoted; she was his advocate and carer. Their love is an example to us all.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He passed away on September 29, 2013 in the care of St Mary’s Villa, Concord. He was buried with his first communion rosary beads, his

        , his Labor Party life membership certificate and his trademark hat, so often tipped on door knocks throughout the electorates he served. In Gaelic, the congregation asked … may his noble soul rest in God’s right hand. He is survived by Margaret, and children Mary, Iona, Fildema, Anthony and Brigid, their spouses and six grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        May he rest in peace and continue to be an inspiration to us all.

        <p>
         I thank the members who have allowed me to talk briefly, following the member for Greenway's emotional words, about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Maher" rel="nofollow">
          Michael Maher
         </a>
         . I want to concur completely with what she had to say about him. Michael Maher was my family's member of federal parliament, and he was a good man. In the spirit of bipartisanship, there are great people on both sides of this House, and he really was one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did not know Michael—I knew of him—but I had the honour of attending his funeral, and I came away from that funeral feeling that I did know him. I think that is testimony to the strength of his faith and his belief in his family. I listened to his four children give eulogies that day and I was moved to tears not knowing him.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remember him being called the 'minister for bus stops', which Michelle made reference to. He was just a great local member. He was there if you needed to talk to him. As I travelled through my electorate, doorknocking in my quest to come to this place, I was told time after a time stories of his days as the member for Lowe.
        </p>
        <p>
         I reiterate the words of Michelle and add my voice to the condolences to his wife, Margaret, and the children. It was touching to be there with them to celebrate the great life that it was. May he rest in peace.
