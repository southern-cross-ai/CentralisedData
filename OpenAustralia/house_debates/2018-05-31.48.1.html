        The Turnbull government has made a hobby out of cutting jobs in Canberra. First we had the member for New England's porkbarrelling, which was the relocation of the APVMA to Armidale. It was said at the time that this all-cost and no-benefit, blatant, shameless porkbarrelling was just the thin end of the wedge. Since then the budget has been released, and what do we hear about?

There are people with disability who describe their jobs as their contribution to the world. As one mother said in the article, her daughter's job with the department is the reason she gets out of the bed in the morning. The government has decided they are easy targets. It's an absolute disgrace. I'm begging, for the sake of my community: hands off Canberra, hands off Public Service job cuts and hands off cuts to—
