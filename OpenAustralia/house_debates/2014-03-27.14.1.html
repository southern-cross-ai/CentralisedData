       </p>
       <p>
        As an important overseas mission in Africa, the Nairobi High Commission is significant in representation terms, as well as acting as a hub for Australia's interest in East, West and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In 2004-05 a global review of physical security at Australia's overseas missions was undertaken, which identified a number of high-risk chanceries, including the current mission in Nairobi.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as providing appropriate physical security, this project will deliver a modern, functional chancery building to accommodate tenant agencies, as well as providing guardhouse, service building and recreational facilities all within a secure compound. The proposed new construction will ensure updated security measures and compliance with Australian standards, and work, health and safety requirements. The estimated cost of the proposal is $57.6 million and includes all construction costs, site preparation, infrastructure, management design fees, contingencies and escalation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Works Committee has reported back to the House and the Senate on this project and recommends that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the major works package is forecast to commence in early 2016, with practical completion and occupancy in late 2018. I commend the motion to the House.

         The Black Mountain
        </a>
        site has an area of 37.3 hectares. The current dispersed layout reflects a legacy of earlier autonomous divisional structures, which are spread across a number of different buildings with replicated activity clusters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent of the proposed consolidation project is to consolidate science, research and support facilities on the Black Mountain site. These new buildings will accommodate staff and functions which currently occupy buildings which have passed their effective design life and which do not meet current standards for health and safety. The buildings which are unsuitable for continued use will be demolished. The estimated cost of the project is $195.6 million plus

        , with the works to occur in two phases.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed, subject to the recommendation that CSIRO continue to consult with its staff with a view to implementing measures to address staff concerns where this is warranted and feasible. I am advised that CSIRO accepts and will implement that recommendation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in July 2014, with completion scheduled for March 2019. I commend the motion to the House.

        . CSIRO requires property to enable its specialised science capabilities. As such, CSIRO needs to ensure that all of its facilities are fit for purpose, support science, and provide facilities which attract leading researchers and scientists to CSIRO. This proposal includes the provision of a new building at North Clayton for science education and the Factories of the Future Innovation Centre. In addition, the new buildings will house the CSIRO science education centres currently located at Highett. The estimated cost of the proposal is $32 million plus GST and includes escalation costs, contingencies, all professional fees and authority charges.

        The Public Works Committee has reviewed the project and reported back to the House and Senate recommending that these works proceed.

         Reserve Bank of Australia
        </a>
        is the sole issuing authority for Australian banknotes. The key objective of the Reserve Bank in meeting this responsibility is to maintain public confidence in Australia's banknotes. The Reserve Bank has embarked on a program to upgrade the security of Australia's banknotes. The Next Generation Banknote project will progressively replace currently circulating banknotes over the next decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current storage, distribution and processing capacity of the Reserve Bank Sydney, Melbourne and Craigieburn sites is insufficient to enable the bank to store and issue the new series of banknotes and to accommodate banknote growth in the medium term. The Reserve Bank proposes to build a national banknote site on vacant land owned by the bank at Craigieburn in Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposal is $72 million, plus GST, and includes all construction costs, site preparation, infrastructure, management design fees, contingencies and escalation.

        The Public Works Committee has reviewed the project and reported back to the House and the Senate. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these projects proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, work is proposed to commence in early 2015 and to be fully operational in early 2017 to enable a transition to the Next Generation Banknote series and meet the banknote storage, distribution and processing operations for at least the next 25 years. With that, I commend the motion to the House.
