        . It is a day to pause and honour the police officers whose lives have been cut short while performing their duties, protecting the community and putting their lives on the line each day for the greater good. It is a day to acknowledge their sacrifice and express our gratitude to their commitment. It is also a time to acknowledge the courage and strength shown by the men and women currently serving, who continue to devote their lives. They are too often taken for granted.

        </a>
        is an important time to reflect on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         National Police Memorial
        </a>
        in Canberra, which pays tribute to Australian police officers who have lost their lives while on duty or as a result of their injuries. The memorial also recognises the unique nature of the police service and the dangers that officers face in their daily duties. As of September last year, the wall and honour roll at the Police Memorial contains the names of 757 fallen police officers. The earliest entry on the roll dates from 1803.
       </p>
       <p>
        While reflecting on the courageous police officers we have tragically lost, I would like to make mention of Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson, who was based at the Hawkesbury Local Area Command in the Macquarie electorate. Detective Inspector Anderson was tragically killed while on duty, responding to a neighbourhood dispute in Oakville in 2012. Bryson's name is the second most recent entry on the wall and honour roll. Detective Inspector Anderson was a loving father and husband, a brother, son, grandson and a great friend and valued colleague to many. Upon hearing the news of Bryson's untimely passing in 2012, I can still vividly recall the sadness and disbelief that spread through the Hawkesbury community, across NSW and throughout Australia. Bryson was a man who put himself on the line shift after shift to selflessly serve the community he loved, cared for and devoted himself to.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that we continue to acknowledge and respect all police officers who, despite the challenges they face, continue to look after the best interests of the community. It is also important to acknowledge the sacrifice that their families make. We need to keep at the forefront of our minds that every day there are police officers simply carrying out their job with the best of intentions when they put on their uniforms and head out into the community. It is an honour to be able to reflect on the positive impact Detective Inspector Anderson had on the Hawkesbury community, and my thoughts and prayers continue to remain with his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Police Remembrance Day signifies the acknowledgement of loss, it also represents a time to reflect on and celebrate the lives of our fallen officers and their achievements. Detective Inspector Anderson had a long career in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">

        before commencing as a duty officer at the Hawkesbury Local Area Command in 2010. He was also involved in the local sporting associations that his children were involved in on weekends.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the dedicated men and women in blue and plain clothes in the electorate of Macquarie, many of whom were colleagues of Bryson, who continue to serve and work for the greater good of the Hawkesbury and
