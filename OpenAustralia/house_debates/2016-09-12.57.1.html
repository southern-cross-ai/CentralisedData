        On 17 August, Parramatta lost one of its own.

        was an international, national and local sporting legend. In a sporting career spanning two codes and two continents, his skills were and still are revered in the rugby league and union communities. He was nicknamed '

        , because of his sheer presence and ability. It was a nickname that stuck and was embraced in Parramatta. From 1962 through to 1968 and then in a further season in 1971 he was of course a Parramatta Eel, and he was a major force in the building of a then fledgling team into a competitive side.

        once described the fullback, who played 130 games for the Eels, as a seventh forward. Ken, who delighted locals with his strength in defence and verve in attack, was known by fellow players simply as 'Bucket', because he never dropped the ball. Phil Russo, a former Parramatta councillor, reflected last on seeing his return to Parramatta in 1971, and said, 'His comeback was like a resurrection, and the aura at the ground was palpable.'

        The Mayor was inducted as one of the greatest 100 players in the first 100 years of rugby league. He will always be in the hearts and minds of the Parramatta community, every time they see his name on the eastern grandstand at Parramatta stadium. The Parramatta community's thoughts are with his family. His deeds will linger in our hearts.
