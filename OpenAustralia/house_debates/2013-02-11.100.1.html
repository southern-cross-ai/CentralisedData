       <p>
        On indulgence, I wish to inform the House of the passing last Thursday evening of Mr Nick Dimopoulos who was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        and Commissioner of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transport_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Transport Commission
        </a>
        . Mr Dimopoulos made a major contribution to the work of the commission since his appointment in 2006, and I greatly valued his advice. The commission plays a leading role in driving national transport regulatory reforms, and Nick's leadership and guidance will be missed by ministers and officials from across the Commonwealth, states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past three years, Nick and the commission have worked very hard to implement the historic national regulatory reforms, which will provide Australia for the first time with a seamless national transport regulatory system. Nick Dimopoulos was committed to improving Australian transport safety and productivity. Nick's professional career spanned industries such as mining, logistics, finance, infrastructure and transport. Prior to joining the

        he held senior positions in both the public and private sectors. He headed up the Committee for

        </a>
        of Australia and worked in the

        infrastructure projects in China. His dedication and professionalism will be sadly missed. Speaker, I passed my condolences on this morning to Nick's widow, Steph, and their children. My thoughts are with them and Nick's colleagues at this time.

        <p>
         On indulgence, I join in acknowledging and recognising the service of Nick Dimopoulos, particularly in his role as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Executive Officer
         </a>
         and Commissioner of the

          National Transport Commission
         </a>
         . He had a distinguished career in government and public policy but worked also in the private sector. His work in driving national transport regulatory reform was challenging and required great dedication and patience. The task has been in progress for a very long time and bit by bit some progress has been achieved. Certainly, Mr Dimopoulos's work in that regard needs to be recognised and acknowledged on this occasion. His contribution to public and private policy is acknowledged with gratitude and I join the minister in extending the condolences of the opposition to his widow and family.
