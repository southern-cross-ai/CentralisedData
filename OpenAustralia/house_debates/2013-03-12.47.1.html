        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. How will the government's infrastructure investment plans help commuters travelling from Sydney's west to the city and how will they help move freight more quickly into

         members with the Prime Minister last week when we announced our commitment to help build the M5 and M4 extensions. We want to work with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government to achieve real improvements to Sydney's motorways. The current New South Wales proposal has a number of weaknesses in it, and we are insisting that they be fixed. That is the way you do good infrastructure development: get your business plan in place first and then get your funding commitments made.
        </p>
        <p>
         The three commitments that we have made are these: (1) that the M4 has to take people into the city, (2) that the M5 has to take freight to the port and (3) that you cannot have new tolls on old roads.

           That is a common-sense position that people in

            Western Sydney
           </a>
           understand. That is why we have contributed $25 million, announced in last year's budget, to enable the business case to be developed: because it is very clear that we need to get the planning in the project right first time, in order to ensure there is proper use of taxpayers' funds.

           Premier O'Farrell has a bit more work to do. First he said the city connection would go to Camperdown. Next he said, in an op-ed in today's

            </a>
           </i>
           , that the city connection would go only as far as Petersham. Next week it might be Ashfield. One thing I do know is that Camperdown and Petersham are not in the city. I do know that taking a freight connection to the side of Sydney airport closest to

           does not get freight to the port.

           , Newtown, is not a thoroughfare; it is a roadblock. Unless we get this right the first time, it will simply fail.

             and the city. She quotes the Leader of the Opposition supporting our policy. And yet, last week when asked whether it was a condition, he was not sure: it was; it was not; it was; it was not. He needs to come clean to the people of Western Sydney. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot have Premier O'Farrell saying, 'We're going to build a road to Petersham with federal money,' and have this Leader of the Opposition pretending that this road is going to take people into the city. He indeed has described his own commitment, which he has made in these advertisements, as being an impossible condition for federal funds.
