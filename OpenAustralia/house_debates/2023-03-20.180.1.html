        was turned into a makeshift hospital where thousands of patients were treated. More than a 100 years later the building was used to combat COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a vaccine hub. The building served as a training base for the

        was internationally recognised. For about 100 years, the Dome Promenade and its 360-degree views were closed to the public. That is why I was thrilled to secure $20 million to conserve, restore and refurbish the building and the dome, which, as of late last year, are now open for tours and events.
