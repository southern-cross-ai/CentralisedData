        town of Macksville. In Macksville flags flew at half-mast, people shook their heads in disbelief, shops and offices went quiet, and the few people on the streets carried on their business with eyes downcast. The local paper, the

        In recent days I have spoken to people in Macksville. They were keen to share their memories of Phillip and their admiration for his achievements. Phillip Hughes was born there 26 years ago last Sunday to Greg and Virginia, hard-working banana farmers. Phillip was raised in a rural community with a strong agricultural heritage. He loved the land and he loved his sport. He was a country boy to a tee and was also a talented rugby league player, having played in the junior league with the famous rugby league international,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Inglis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it was cricket that was his passion. He played for the Macksville Ex-Services Cricket Club Juniors. His talents were recognised early in his career, being selected for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Grade" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at the age of only 12—an amazing achievement in itself. Phillip instituted night cricket in the backyard of the Macksville family home with his brother Jason. They played for hours under a spotlight until called into the house each evening. Young men from country areas have been a source of great talent over the years for Australian cricket. Phillip took the big step of moving to Sydney when he was 17 to pursue his dream. He worked hard, tirelessly, to wear baggy green cap No. 408, to be a test player for Australia. It was not easy but he achieved his goal—the childhood dream of so many Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is common to many successful young people from the Nambucca Valley that they retain a love for their home towns and return whenever possible. This was also true of Phillip. He always came home when his extensive commitments permitted. He would attend the presentation nights at the Macksville Ex-Services Junior Cricket Club whenever he could. Mayor Rhonda Hoban described to me how Phillip never tired of signing an endless stream of favourite bats and caps. She said he appeared to remember what it was like to dream of playing for Australia. As well as his passion for cricket, Phillip had a passion for the land and his Angus cattle. He was working on improving a property which he purchased for the development of an Angus stud. As with his commitment to junior cricket in the Nambucca, he also took pride in showing and leading his cattle in the local show.

        Yesterday I attended the service in honour of the life of Phillip Hughes along with the Prime Minister, Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Baird
        </a>
        , the sports minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Phillip's death is an event that has certainly united us in this House as it has united the nation in grief. The spirit of community runs deep in Macksville and it seemed the entire town and surrounding district turned out to show their respect. The local shops closed their doors and townspeople lined the streets for the funeral procession. Such was the esteem in which this young man was held that the service I would suggest was probably the largest event ever to occur in Macksville.
       </p>
       <p>
        We cannot walk in the shoes of parents Greg and Virginia and siblings Jason and Megan but we can as a nation show that we care. The Hughes family can be rightly proud of the contribution their son and brother has made to Australian sport and our nation, of the young cricketers he has inspired and of the respect with which he was held in his community. He will forever remain an inspiration to the people of the Nambucca Valley. Phillip Hughes we honour you—63 not out
