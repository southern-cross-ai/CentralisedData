        In 1987 I was elected to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessnock_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Cessnock City Council
        </a>
        , a great honour I should say. In Easter of 1988 what was then the latest section of the F3 freeway was open to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemans_Waterhole" rel="nofollow">
         Freemans Waterhole
        </a>
        , which was in my electorate. From that day the residents in the Cessnock local government area were subject to national highway traffic spilling onto their local streets as motorists and heavy-transport drivers sought to make their way from the F3 freeway to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         New England Highway
        </a>
        , and then further north largely, in the case of heavy transport, going on to Brisbane. I joined with a number of local people to fight for a major highway link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway, just north of Branxton, as a means of taking that pressure off local Cessnock roads, so alleviating the safety concerns of motorists and residents, alleviating the massive inconvenience that motorists were experiencing locally, addressing safety concerns and of course providing a much-needed bypass of Cessnock and Maitland—and a number of communities in between—which were suddenly suffering the consequences of this national highway traffic. Thankfully, the then Labor government agreed to build this road transport link. In fact, it put forward initially three or four options. I was very proud to be a person who put forward a submission advocating the adoption of the so-called option C, which later became known as the Kurri Corridor. In 1995 I was pleased to investigate the route of option C with the then transport minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Brereton" rel="nofollow">
         Laurie Brereton
        </a>
        , who reaffirmed on that occasion the Labor government’s commitment to this very important transport link.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alas, in 1996 the Howard government was elected and, sadly, the project came to a halt—a great disappointment for me and all those who live in the Hunter region. Surprisingly, the so-called Belford Bends Deviation, which will now form the northern extremity of the so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Expressway" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Expressway
        </a>
        , was also cancelled by the Howard government notwithstanding the fact that contracts for the project had actually been let. A big campaign by the local community forced the Howard government into reinstating the funding for the Belford Bends Deviation but we did not have such success with what was then called the Kurri Corridor but is now called the Hunter Expressway.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can appreciate my delight when, after a 10-year delay, the Rudd government announced this year that it would contribute some $1.65 billion towards the Hunter Expressway—great news for the Hunter community. We should have been driving on this road by now and we would have been driving on this road now if the Howard government had maintained the former Keating government’s commitment to the Hunter Expressway.

          I cannot believe the Leader of the National Party has intervened, because he of course was transport minister for most of that period. In fact I recall that one day he went to Singleton to announce the Muswellbrook bypass, such is his knowledge of the local transport needs of the residents of the Hunter region. I am obviously delighted that it took a Labor government to plan the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Expressway" rel="nofollow">
           Hunter Expressway
          </a>
          , and we had to wait for another Labor government to build the Hunter Expressway.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have talked about local benefits. I would like to ask the minister if he could expand on the benefits of the Hunter Expressway to the efficient movement of people and freight along the eastern seaboard from Melbourne to Cairns.

           I have got the reverse story to the member for Hunter’s story. I can proudly stand here and say that about a decade ago I began a furious fight to get the new bypass for Townsville underway, and the first section of that was the building of the Douglas arterial road. There was a furious fight with the state government in trying to get matching funding. Ultimately our community won that. It was a road of national importance, so it attracted fifty-fifty support from the state. We won that fight and we got that road opened and the community really appreciated the difference it made, because it had a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCR" rel="nofollow">
            BCR
           </a>
           of something like 13, and it cut travel time by up to 20 minutes between the two points.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2004 I saw the need to extend that road to connect to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Bruce Highway
           </a>
           in the northern beaches, and that was going to be the Townsville ring-road. We fought for that money and we got that money and construction commenced on the Townsville ring-road; that has now been completed. That created a bypass for heavy vehicles around the city of Townsville. It also created a very quick link from the northern beaches to the hospital, to the university and to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
            Lavarack Barracks
           </a>
           for the Army. That will see very significant development occurring in the northern beaches area of the city. We could see then, with the connection of the ring-road to the Douglas arterial, that the Douglas arterial would not cope and that it had to be extended to four lanes. We proceeded to fight to get the money for the four-laning. That was another $55 million. In the budget before last, the government announced that $55 million would be provided and that we could get on with the four-laning of the Douglas arterial. That has not really proceeded. It was reannounced in this year’s budget and a small amount of that $55 million was provided, probably for design work. But I am puzzled: we have known about this and Queensland Main Roads have known about this for some years and I am really surprised that the design work has not yet been done.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, all of us want these shovel-ready projects, particularly the stimulus projects. We all want them to be stimulating the economy. But, unfortunately, this is a case where we are unable to get on with the job. The minister and I will work together on this one because we both want the same outcome. We want to see this project started. I would like to ask the minister whether he would have a look at the status of this particular project. When does he expect the project to commence? How can we speed it up? How can we get it going? It is very important for Townsville that we get on with the four-laning of the Douglas arterial. I thank the minister.

            I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for some great initiatives in this year’s budget. I want to talk about a number of infrastructure projects in my electorate and then ask the minister a question. In particular, I would like to commend the minister on the budgeting for the rail extension to Seaford. I have talked about this a number of times, because this project is absolutely critical for the residents of Seaford and the southern suburbs of Adelaide.
           </p>
           <p>
            This project will be a 5.5-kilometre rail extension from Noarlunga with a bridge over the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkaparinga_River" rel="nofollow">
             Onkaparinga River
            </a>
            to Seaford. This bridge has been a sticking point for many years. This rail corridor has been in the pipeline for about 30 years, believe it or not, and there have been promises, promises and promises about this, from many governments. The sticking point has been the bridge over the Onkaparinga River, because it is a very long bridge. I am very pleased that this government has not only committed to building this bridge, which is 1.2 kilometres long—0.1 kilometres longer than the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
             Sydney Harbour Bridge
            </a>
            —but it is also going to commit to build a dual track-way to Seaford. This is really important.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are talking about stimulus. I have been informed that this project alone will create over 400 jobs in the next four years, which is incredibly important to local people. What is more important to local residents in my electorate is that there is a time frame for this, because previous governments said, ‘We know there’s a need, but we’ll do it later.’ There is a very clear time line here and it is ready to go. Construction will start in 2010 and be completed in 2013. This is really important.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to thank the minister for coming down to my electorate to meet with the Seaford District Residents Association. Ron and Harold—Harold could not be there; he was very disappointed, Minister, that he could not meet with you—have been advocates for this project for many, many years. They were very pleased to have the chance to spend time with the minister to talk with him about the project, but they were more impressed to see action on this project, which is really important.
           </p>
           <p>
            The previous member for Kingston wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper the other day, saying that he had asked for the rail and that he should get the credit for this. But unfortunately he asked and nothing was delivered to him. I was very concerned to hear that the Leader of the Opposition has said that all these projects are up for review. I tell you, the residents in my electorate do not want the Seaford rail extension reviewed again; they want action on it. This is an incredibly important part of the budget. This is something that is going to leave a legacy for tomorrow and really create jobs today.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, I was very pleased to see in the budget the improvements to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Harbor_Road" rel="nofollow">
             Victor Harbor Road
            </a>
            -Main South Road intersection, something that will be funded under the new nation-building plan. I had a briefing the other day about this project. This project will reduce waiting times at that intersection from eight minutes to 40 seconds. That is a huge improvement in terms of urban congestion and certainly has been welcomed by people. This is good not just for people in my electorate of Kingston but also for the many tourists who use the Victor Harbor Road-Main South Road intersection, who love the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleurieu_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
             Fleurieu Peninsula
            </a>
            , who love to go on holiday there, but are frustrated with the waiting times. I am very pleased that the expected completion date of this is 2010. Once again, this is local jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the brief time I have, I also commend the minister for working with local councils in my area. The extra funding that has been provided for them has been welcomed. It is going to mean solar panels on community centres, footpath improvements that are desperately needed by local residents in my electorate and a whole range of different garden and reserve improvements, including play equipment for the local kids in the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            My question to the minister is: could you tell us a little bit more about the infrastructure that is happening in

            <p>
             The government have been very strong in coming out and saying that they are investing record amounts of money on road and rail. This is of course just record spin. In reality, the Labor government will actually spend less on rail and road than the previous coalition government had committed prior to the last election and, what’s more, they are spreading the funding over six years instead of the five that had been committed to by the previous government. The minister is also very strong at criticising the former government about rorts and so I want to turn my initial attention to the choice of projects and how projects were chosen to be funded through this government’s program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the major items were in fact funded, we are told, as a result of investigations by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Infrastructure Australia
             </a>
             . However, the government will not make available any of the documentation, case studies or arguments that were put up which led to the choice of these particular projects. In fact, they have not even told us which projects were specifically chosen as the highest priorities by Infrastructure Australia. All we have are two lists: one called ‘Priority projects/actions ready to proceed’ and a second one called ‘Priority infrastructure pipeline projects with real potential’. However, the government have not indicated why particular projects were chosen and have refused to make available any of the working documents. How could anyone call this a fair and transparent process when in fact the government will not open up their documentation to any kind of scrutiny? One of the projects chosen was not on either list. I ask the minister: why was the O-Bahn track extension approved when it was not considered by Infrastructure Australia and was not recommended either as being close to ready or as one that should be given further consideration, especially since the

             n minister said it was news to him when the announcement was actually made?
            </p>
            <p>
             I refer also to the biggest single commitment, the $3.2 billion for the Regional Rail Express project in Melbourne—over three-quarters of the entire allocation. It is interesting to note that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Rod_Eddington" rel="nofollow">
              Sir Rod Eddington
             </a>
             completed a study on improving east-west transport connections across Melbourne and he recommended that this project proceed. Lo and behold, Sir Rod Eddington is also the chairman of Infrastructure Australia. So he has actually recommended a project he recommended the first time be given priority over all others. I ask the minister to answer whether Sir Rod Eddington stepped aside from the consideration of this project where he clearly had a keen interest so that there can be absolute public confidence that it was assessed fairly and did not have an unfair advantage because the chairman of Infrastructure Australia had an association with that project.
            </p>
            <p>
             While we are on the subject of choosing projects, I would like to turn to the new Nation Building Program off-network projects. This was the old regional strategic roads program that the government has worked hard to strike the word ‘regional’ from. In fact, when the Senate looked like messing it up today and re-including the word ‘regional’ in the program, the minister had to run to get the Greens to change their vote so that it could be recommitted. This is supposed to be the minister for regional development but he is trying to wipe the word ‘regional’ out of every government program. So we now have the Nation Building Program off-network projects. I would ask the minister what transparent processes were undertaken to choose the projects to be funded under this network because, of the $655.2 million in the proposed road and rail funding, $532.9 million is being shovelled into Labor held electorates. Most of the other projects—perhaps with the exception of only one—are in electorates that Labor was targeting at the last election. Indeed, most of these projects were announced by Labor candidates during the last election. I ask the minister: when were other projects given an opportunity to be considered for this funding network? Will there be a call for nominations for funding for these projects from people other than Labor Party candidates, or is this in fact just a giant rort to fund Labor Party election commitments? When you have 82 per cent of all the funding for what was a regional roads program now being spent in Labor seats, and most of it in city areas, it is quite clear that this government did not adopt proper transparent processes and that this has been a gigantic rort and abuse of taxpayer money.

              say from the very outset that I certainly welcome the $646 million investment in the three major public transport projects that were part of the Rudd government’s $22 billion investment in road, rail and ports around this country. Those three projects that went to

              </a>
              cover the three major corridors into the suburban parts of metropolitan Adelaide. Two of them in fact will have direct benefits for the people of Makin, whom I represent—those are, firstly, the $294 million Gawler rail line re-sleepering and electrification and, secondly, the $61 million towards the O-Bahn bus service that was just talked about by the member for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
               Wide Bay
              </a>
              . I will come to that in just a moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Gawler railway line is a project that will assist not only the people in Makin but also those people who are moving into the fastest-growing part of the metropolitan area of Adelaide. Already we have a railway line that is very heavily used. In respect to the people of Makin, it is used because, whilst it does not pass through the electorate of Makin, it passes very close to it. People from Makin in fact use the interchange both at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawson_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
               Mawson Lakes
              </a>
              and at Salisbury, where they can assess the rail service and within about 15 minutes get into the CBD of Adelaide. In fact that service is being used so much that there is now a need to expand the car park at Mawson Lakes because of all the people who go down and use it before getting on the train. So I know that is one service that is very much appreciated by the people whom I represent.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second matter is the one dealing with the O-Bahn bus service.

               Southern Expressway
              </a>
              in Adelaide, which goes through to the electorate of Kingston. Some years ago the Southern Expressway was built and initiated by the previous state Liberal government. It is a typical example of a road that was only ever half built. It goes in one direction for half of the time and then you reverse the order and you get the reverse direction for the other half of the day. The O-Bahn was the same. It was a bus carriageway that was built in about 1980 and initiated by the state Liberal government. Regrettably, the job was never finished. It stopped short of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_CBD" rel="nofollow">
               Adelaide CBD
              </a>
              by about two kilometres. It is that last two kilometres where you get the real traffic congestion and where people are delayed for 10 minutes at least, and usually longer, in getting to their workplace. So the commitment of $61 million towards the completion of that last two kilometres is going to be of huge benefit to those people. Something like 20,000 people or more a day use the O-Bahn bus service—in fact about 27,000 people a day use the O-Bahn bus service. We are talking about saving 10 minutes on the inward bound trip and 10 minutes on the outward bound trip at the very least. When you are a working mum or dad that extra 20 minutes or perhaps half an hour with your children makes a lot of difference.
             </p>
             <p>
              In respect to the criticism by the member for Wide Bay, I can say this: this was a project that I raised with my state government colleagues on several occasions, including with the minister’s office. It was not an election promise; it was one of those projects that I had taken up since being elected as the member for Makin on behalf of the people I represent. I certainly have no regrets about doing that whatsoever. It is interesting however that this project also services the people of the electorate of Sturt. I wonder whether the member for Sturt is also opposed to and concerned about the fact that we have committed funds to making this service even better. It will be interesting to hear his comments because I have heard other
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
               South Australian
              </a>
              federal members criticise this commitment. I really wonder whether the people they represent would be pleased. They would want to know exactly what their position on this issue is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can tell members of this chamber that on only Saturday I again discussed this particular project with the state member for Newland, Mr Tom Kenyon. We were talking about the benefits it will bring to those residents of the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. It is a project that is well and truly overdue. This should have been done almost 30 years ago when the project was first conceived. This project is one that I certainly welcome and one that will be welcomed by the people whom I represent.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last point I want to make very quickly is this: I notice that $1 million was committed to the widening of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_Road" rel="nofollow">
               Montague Road
              </a>
              at Clovercrest. Again, this is a project that is well and truly overdue. This should have been done 20 years ago. It is a project that will hopefully open up a bottleneck that exists at the junction of Montague Road and Kelly Road which during peak hour becomes a nightmare for all those people who use it. To the minister I say: thank you.

               The infrastructure spending in the budget should have been the government’s first stimulus package not the third, and for obvious reasons. When there is a financial crisis claimed to be the worst in 80 years, the way in which we spend every dollar is critical. We must get the most out of every dollar spent. We on this side of the House listened for 12 months or more before the last election to those opposite telling us they had a plan for infrastructure. We heard it ad nauseam. We heard that they had a deeply considered plan for infrastructure. Yet it took 18 months in government and seven months of the financial crisis before there was one decision. That decision took 2½ years and we were seven months into the financial crisis before we heard that they had a detailed, considered plan ready to put to the Australian people. They had already spent tens of billions of dollars on handouts before we saw one decision, and that was in this budget. Then, when we finally saw a decision, most of those projects had been under active consideration by the former government.

                 Yes, absolutely; that is right. Some were underway. These are decisions you have just taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What we needed in those critical times was to see spending on major infrastructure taking clear priority over reckless debt funded handouts, which preceded so much of the decision making and the spending. Even now there will only be $1.7 billion spent over the next 12 months on major infrastructure. And, in the following year, only $3.5 billion will be spent on major infrastructure. What a joke this is for a party that came to office, spruiked a plan for 12 months and then sat on their hands for another 18 months before they made any announcement whatsoever. Now they will only spend a bit over $5 billion in two years, having racked up a debt of $315 billion. I would like to know from the minister what sort of analysis has been undertaken of the job impact of the $1.7 billion that will be spent this year and the $3.5 billion that will be spent next year in regard to these major infrastructure projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The second issue I would like to raise is one previously raised by my honourable colleague. Last year we heard, again ad nauseam, that with these projects the government would, quite properly, place a huge priority on transparency. We heard criticisms of the former government, again ad nauseam, about a lack of transparency. This minister and the government opposite told us endlessly last year about transparency. They set up a process—
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Infrastructure Australia
                 </a>
                 —which we supported, and I think it was a solid process. This minister told us about transparency ad nauseam. Then we have $8½ billion of taxpayers’ money being spent. We get another $600 million of state taxpayers’ money. We have a black hole of another $60 billion to fund the projects that were announced in the budget. We had all of that money yet we have not seen one iota of detail of the cost-benefit analyses, or any of the assumptions that underlie that analysis, that were undertaken by Infrastructure Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It makes a mockery of what we heard for 12 months. This minister opposite lectured and lectured, ridiculed and lectured—we heard it ad nauseam—and he has not delivered one iota of detail on a cost-benefit analysis. The essence of assessing the work of any major project has to be what you will get back for the dollar. It is a question of how much return you will get. No-one has the ability to see whether politics has been played in all of this process. Why were some projects put ahead of other projects? Why were projects taken off the second list, where a lot of detail is still to be finished? Why was a project taken when it was not even included in Infrastructure Australia? We would like a sensible reason from the minister opposite as to why this government refuses to provide the fundamental details which will help the opposition, and more importantly the sector and the state governments and others, to make a proper assessment of whether this minister has played politics with major government funds.

                  There have been a number of questions raised. Firstly, the member for Hunter gave a historical analysis of the development of the

                   Hunter Expressway
                  </a>
                  —that it took a previous Labor government to have planning for the Hunter Expressway and it has taken another Labor government to get on with the business of building it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We are very pleased that, as one of the infrastructure priority-list projects, we are providing some $1.45 billion. There is $200 million being provided by the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                   New South Wales
                  </a>
                  government. This is an absolutely critical project. We actually have to get on with the business of this. There are still some properties to be purchased before construction can commence there. In spite of the rhetoric of the previous government, there had not been an appropriate allocation to allow this expressway to be built. It is a common theme that we hear from those opposite: they were always going to get around to it in their 13th year; they were always going to get around to it in their sixth or seventh or eight term. They actually did not do anything about it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I was asked by the member for Herbert about the Douglas Arterial duplication. I can inform him, through the House, that $55 million has been committed by the Rudd government for this project, which has been matched by the state government of Queensland. That construction will commence this year, in the third quarter. I thank him for his question.

                  We had the member for Kingston raise the Seaford to Noarlunga line. That was a very important project that we were very pleased to announce in the budget, and I was pleased to travel to her electorate the following week, with the Treasurer, for that announcement. That was the very day that the Leader of the Opposition drew into question the ongoing support for those projects, when he stated that all projects would have to be under review. He made that statement in Adelaide, and it was certainly one of great concern to the people of

                  … government will invest $22.3 billion in Australia’s land transport system from 2009–10 to 2013–14 …
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is the truth of what they budgeted: $22.3 billion. They run around and they say that there was all this money committed, but it was never in a budget. It was not in their first budget; it was not in their second, third, or fourth; it was not in any of the number of budgets that they committed—not one. They cannot produce a budget paper to show the funding that is there, because the budget papers show the reality, which is some $22 billion—certainly not $31 billion.

                  process. This is the most rigorous process that we have ever had for infrastructure development in this nation. It is also a process that is transparent. The methodology for going through each of these projects is on the Infrastructure Australia website. The fact is that, as part of the budget, we produced detailed analysis of each and every project, each and every process.

                  The member for Wide Bay raised the issue of the O-Bahn. The member for Makin quite rightly pointed out how important this project is to him. Let me explain it very clearly to the member for Wide Bay so he finally gets it. There are two projects that were funded in the budget that are not funded out of the Building Australia Fund. The Building Australia Fund is used to fund Infrastructure Australia projects, but the government have a range of other infrastructure initiatives, one of which we have said is the establishment of a major cities unit, a major cities program, with support for sustainability, productivity and liveability in our cities. That is what we said we would do with major cities.

                  There are two projects. One of them is the O-Bahn. The second is the Northbridge project in Perth,

                    They are very slow, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz. Those projects are not funded by the Building Australia Fund. Both of those projects are funded because they are good public transport projects in our cities that will improve the productivity, liveability and sustainability of those cities—Perth and Adelaide.

                    also raised the issue of off-network projects. I note that they pursued the amendment in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. They did not pursue it there. They say we are funding off-network projects in city areas, but they did it in regional areas. They used off-network projects to fund Campbell Parade,

                    and roads in the electorate of Bennelong. They used to fund whatever was politically—in an opportunistic way—suitable for their politics. It had nothing to do with regional funding. Their opportunism is simply extraordinary.

                    The problem with infrastructure spending is that it is long term. There aren’t that many projects that are literally shovel ready and so while infrastructure spending is a very important and legitimate part of a response to a downturn, you’ve got to make sure the infrastructure is infrastructure you would be spending money on anyway.

                    What is more, on Fran Kelly’s program, the shadow minister himself said, ‘That’s why I raised earlier the significance of looking at maintenance programs across the country.’ That is what he raised, because it was in the context of shovel-ready projects that were important.

                    What the government has done with its range of stimulus packages is, first, stimulated consumer demand and, second, brought forward infrastructure projects—14 roads projects, $711 million; the injection of $1.2 billion into the

                    <p>
                     I have a couple of questions. I will start with local government. Minister, local government was told on 28 November that there was immediate cash available. I quote the Prime Minister:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     By immediate, I mean immediate. Immediate means now. It’s ready to go now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yet the funding did not flow through until late February. Are you in a position to help with any cash-flow problems that may emerge in some councils because of that delay?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have a question in relation to the decision to pull forward a quarter of the quarterly financial assistance grants payments for 2009-10, which was an initiative that no-one asked for. In Senate estimates, not one of your officials could point to anyone in local government who asked for this quarterly pull forward of the 2009-10 financial assistance grants payments. Minister, can you point to someone who thought that that was a good idea? Again, will you be in a position to help with any cash-flow problems that councils approach you with? Was this instead really about getting $480 million out of the deficit for 2009-10 and pulling it into this year?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On the topic of treating people thoughtfully, what are you going to do, Minister—and I know that you like a little bit of rough and tumble in politics—about the way in which area consultative committees have been treated, which is an abomination? They deserved some respect and the courtesy of the thanks of a grateful nation for more than a dozen years of work, and all they get is being told through some bureaucratic letter that they are likely to have their funding cease. They are being asked whether they are going to die on their sword and whether they have any cash left that can be clawed back. They deserve better than that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     These were not political appointments. They were local people with insights into their regional economy and into their training infrastructure. If you are not prepared to send a thankyou letter, have the member for Brand send one; have somebody send a thankyou letter. I spoke about this issue in the parliament. I have had emails from right across the continent of Australia saying, ‘Thank goodness somebody in Canberra is saying thank you for that contribution.’ You should lift your game and do the right thing by the area consultative committees, Minister. You know that that is not the way to treat people who have given service to this country. It is downright disrespectful. It is an abomination. They deserved better. If you want to fit them up with some other arrangement, that is a decision of government, but there is no excuse for treating people so appallingly and with the disrespect that you have displayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On the topic of building the nation, is that just rhetoric that provides no explanation, Minister? That seems to be what it is. The

                     was a project that was not only shovel ready but which had people of your political persuasion out there with shovels begging you, Minister, to make some of the money available.

                     thought it was worth putting some money into; the former Howard government were committed to a substantial amount of funding to make sure that we in the south-east and southern areas of Melbourne were not fitted up again in another betrayal by a Labor state government saying: ‘We’d love to give you a toll free road, but we’ve got no money. If you want it, it’s going have to be tolled.’ We are the only community in greater Melbourne that pays to use the arterial ring road. Minister, what is the explanation for you ignoring the needs of our community and ignoring the advice from Infrastructure Australia and instead having projects like the O-Bahn fall out of the sky and so concuss the transport minister in
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You have belled the cat today. We have learnt that all of this hoopla about Infrastructure Australia is nonsense when it does not suit the Labor government. We have heard from the member for Brand that the Premier, in a little sweetheart deal, was behind the Northbridge project. The member for Makin has made it clear that it was a purely political process that led to us getting the O-Bahn. This is not openness about infrastructure expenditure. Where do you get off, with this pea-and-thimble trip, in saying that depending on where the money comes from the rigour that is needed to judge the projects changes? What kind of funny money talk is that? The same level of scrutiny should be applied to everything. The fact that the same level of scrutiny is not applied to everything should be condemned and it shows what a fraud this is and how you are misusing the good people of Infrastructure Australia in terms of the evaluation of projects.

                       I withdraw. I meant that the process is a fraud, Minister. My apologies if it came out as though I meant that you were a fraud. I know that you are very genuine—except when it comes to the

                       s, but that is a discussion for another day. The process is a fraud, and it has been shown to be a fraud by this pea-and-thimble explanation that, depending on what pot of money it comes from, a whole different set of evaluation criteria is applied. This is taxpayers’ money. They deserve scrutiny and accountability wherever that money comes from and however you want to brand it. Talking about branding things, what about broadband and the $43 billion? I offered your party a way forward to a proper analysis of this project in the Senate.

                         I say to the member for Dunkley: ask the mayors in the bushfire affected areas in Victoria, for example, whether they supported this measure. Ask them who supported this initiative. The member for Dunkley also raised the issue of the timing of local government funding. We held the

                         at the end of last year. It was not attended by the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Party, but we went ahead anyway and it was an extremely successful event. Mayors from all around the country attended and next week more than 400 mayors will gather here once again for the Australian Council of Local Government held in conjunction with ALGA as requested by local government.

                         We had a process whereby we dealt with the allocation of the $800 million, both the $250 million to each local government area and the $550 million for strategic projects, in a way that ensured that the funding was provided as soon as was possible, contingent on good processes including, after consultation with the Audit Office, ensuring that there was good value for taxpayer money. We had a process for the $250 million whereby each council had to have its application in and it had to meet the criteria. Every council in the country benefited from it, unlike the scam under the Regional Partnerships program, condemned by the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
                          National Audit Office
                         </a>
                         , whereby 10 coalition seats—every one of them coalition seats—got most of the money under that program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Under strategic partnerships we also had an appropriate process that ensured that we had outside bodies look at each application to make an assessment of whether it met the guidelines and to do a risk assessment. Under that you will note that 53 per cent of the funding for the $800 million went to Labor seats, 41 per cent, I think the figure was, went to coalition seats and six or thereabouts went to Independent seats. In fact the Labor Party got less than the proportion of seats that we hold in the parliament.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Can you imagine that happening under the former government? Under the former government the number of Regional Partnerships program funding, the number of community infrastructure funding for local government in my electorate, for example, was zero—not a cent in 12 years. Every single electorate in this country has benefited, and every single local government area has benefited as well. On the speed of projects we have delivered $800 million over 18 months. The previous government allocated about $70 million a year for

It sat there for four years, nothing happened under RP, something that was criticised by the National Audit Office in their analysis of RP. The parliamentary secretary can talk about

                         <p>
                          I rise to raise some issues that have been brought to us by the member for Dunkley, specifically those relating to Regional Development Australia,
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
                           RDA
                          </a>
                          . In his question he referred to correspondence from our department to former area consultative committee members. I am not aware of the detail of that correspondence, but I appreciate that you will have given an accurate reflection of its content. To the extent that the content of that letter does not reflect the government’s view that people who are part of area consultative committee networks performed to a very high standard, there are people there who worked very hard indeed in the interests of their communities. There are people there who saw the interests of their community and sought to serve. There are people on the area consultative committees who genuinely view the interests of their communities as being both worth while and the sort of thing on which they sought to represent their communities on area consultative committees as best they could. It is unfortunate that in so many ways people feel, as we transform to the new entity, Regional Development Australia, that their efforts have not been recognised and understood. We do understand that.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          What I would like to say, too, is that in the process of transitioning to RDA it is our intention—advised by people from regional Australia, advised by state governments, advised by local governments and advised by members of communities—that what they really would like is a one-stop shop, a single entity that they can deal with on regional development issues. It would mean that good, serious members of communities did not have to attend an area consultative committee meeting, their local council or shire meeting and then their additional meeting as part of a state development commission. So what we are doing here is bringing together two serious instruments, including the instrument which states have—in the case of Victoria, Regional Development Victoria, significantly supported by the Victorian government—with the intention of creating a good public policy framework around the delivery of regional development policies but, most importantly, to bring budget strength from the state government to match the insights of communities as part of RDA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Doing that does mean that difficult choices are to be made. We understand that. We recognise that. We are up for the difficult decisions—we always have been. But we are not up for accepting that the process of making this transformation is at all wrong, unfair or a misuse of government funding. The people in the area consultative committees have in fact over the course of the last two years been insulted by two things.

                             They have been insulted, first, by the abuse that was present in the way in which decisions were made about Regional Partnerships by the former government—and you know that. The member for Dunkley knows that. He has seen the three-volume report. He knows it runs to over 1,200 pages of critique of the way in which members of the community were taken for granted.

We understand the importance of doing that. We understand the importance of the service made by members of area consultative committees. We understand the value that they brought to the table and we understand, too, the disgraceful way in which that trust was taken by a government hell-bent on shovelling as much pork as it could into 10 seats—the devil take the hindmost.

Specifically, what consultation will be undertaken with industry in the formulation of amendments to the Navigation Act, when will the government’s response to the 14 recommendations made by the coastal shipping inquiry be finalised and when will it be made public?

                                   In terms of maritime security, Minister, I refer to the fact that the maritime security identification cards, or MSICs, overseen by the Office of Transport Security are causing a lot of concern in our water protection regime. There are many concerns, including about people with suspect criminal histories being allowed in sensitive maritime security zones. Some of these people have links with organised crime, especially bikie syndicates, and there is a lack of monitoring of personnel in maritime security zones. Questions in estimates revealed that the

                                   TS has confirmed that 42 people have received an MSIC on appeal.

                                   Minister, the questions are: can you advise what maritime security related offences the 42 MSIC applicants that failed their AusCheck security clearance but were granted an MSIC on appeal by your department committed, why did your department think it fit to give access to sensitive maritime security zones to applicants deemed to be unfit by AusCheck, what is the current status of the review of the maritime security identification cards, and when will it be finalised and made public?

                                    s. I would like to give him a history lesson. When the coalition were elected to government, early in the piece, they sacked some of the then regional economic development organisations by email or by fax. In 1997,

                                    was the minister responsible for regional development, and he axed the whole department. That is how important regional development was to the National Party and the coalition. So, when you make accusations, get your facts right—absolutely right. I have lived for a long time in a seat that the National Party held for nearly 100 years and did nothing for, delivered nothing to, but instead said one thing here and another thing back in the electorate.

                                    then talked about rorts and frauds. The only rorts and frauds that were committed were political rorts and frauds by the National Party, in a declining party, in the regional seats.

                                    He raised it. I am telling the truth. You go around there appointing your senators to run around and tell lies all around the electorate. You have no commitment to regional development, none whatsoever. It is all a rort.

                                    I commend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for the investment in national infrastructure, in nation building, in jobs and in my seat of Page, which did not have anything put into it for ages. I will start with the Alstonville bypass. The local community lobbied for the Alstonville bypass for 17 years. They were promised all sorts of things. Nobody ever delivered. This government and this minister are delivering $90 million. But the Leader of the National Party in

                                    did not get this right either. On radio the other day he was talking about how it might be at risk under the state budget. Not a cent of it is from the state; it is all federal dollars—$90 million. That just shows how out of touch and ill informed they are. Ninety million dollars put into the Alstonville bypass will make a huge difference to our local community, where about 20,000 cars daily go through Alstonville. They will be able to deviate around Alstonville and make a difference.

                                      I will talk about some other projects in the seat of Page. The Grafton regional saleyards upgrade is a small investment, $125,000, but it makes a massive difference to an industry, our beef industry, that brings in lots of dollars to our local regional economy. This was an election commitment delivered in the first budget, the budget of 2008-09. When it was put to the National Party during the election that they should fund it, they said no. Can you imagine the National Party saying no to funding an upgrade to the saleyards for the beef industry?

                                       I will respond just briefly to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. I agree with some comments that the minister made earlier about priority.

                                       and, as the minister would be aware, 50 per cent of freight going anywhere in Victoria, New South Wales and southern Queensland is actually in that Hunter-Moree corridor.

                                       One of the great things that the budget did deliver—and you mentioned it a moment ago, Minister—was part of the $1.2 billion in the December announcement. Part of that process was a $580 million upgrade of what is called the Murrurundi tunnel, or Ardglen tunnel, between the electorate of New England and the Hunter. That is probably the most significant piece of infrastructure in terms of speeding up freight—and, as I said, 50 per cent of the freight on the eastern seaboard, in a sense, is on that particular route. The question, Minister—and you may not be able to answer it here and now, but could you take it on board—is: when will that upgrade of the Murrurundi tunnel commence? When will that be starting? Could you give the answer to me on notice, Minister, because I think it is very significant, particularly given the rhetoric that the government has been using. There are two other brief issues. In conjunction with the member for Page, I would ask you to look at the Legume to Woodenbong road, a road of regional significance linking southern Queensland with the

                                            superclinic, the building of which will commence very soon. I think the member for Herbert was the witness for the signing of that contract, and it was good to have the support. It is going to be a benefit in the community.

                                            The member for Herbert raised with me an additional issue about a PET scanner for Townsville, and I am happy for my department to continue to have discussions and look at that. But we are talking about investments that were made in this budget, and this is not an announcement that was made in this budget. Of course, there will be an opportunity in the future to look at a way that it can be provided. I know that the member for Herbert is pleased about the very significant investments that have been made in his electorate, and we are certainly happy to continue to talk with him. I think he might have slightly verballed me when he thanked me for my support for the PET scanner, because a decision has not been made by the government. But we are happy to work with the member for Herbert, as we are with all members, if there are needs in particular communities. But they will get assessed according to the normal procedures and it is not a commitment from this budget, although there are some very significant budget commitments in the member for Herbert’s electorate.

My electorate has rapidly growing areas, such as the southern suburbs of Cairns, that need new health services to tackle many of the chronic illnesses we experience in this country.

                                             You can build infrastructure but you also have to provide the workforce to work in the new clinics. I would like the minister to outline and expand upon the Rudd government’s $134.4 million rural and remote workforce package. You spoke about that when you came to my electorate. I know there are benefits in terms of attracting and providing incentives for doctors to come to places like Cairns,

He has been one of the most tireless advocates for health needs within his community, which is a very diverse electorate. The member for Leichhardt’s seat is a good case study in where the government is prioritising its effort with the health budget. We are changing a system that the previous government had in place—the

                                              . This has fundamentally changed the sorts of incentives that we provide for doctors who go and work up in the cape. It has changed the incentives that are provided for doctors working in Cairns.

                                              There is a whole range of other initiatives, which I know the member for Leichhardt will be pleased about, that show our investments across the whole health system. The $130,000 that is going into Leichhardt for various programs spans Indigenous health and provides more money for the division of GPs, because the formula for what GPs had been paid previously was based on very old data. We have more money going into the Mums and Bubs program run by the Indigenous health service. I think that it will be really useful over the coming years to see how those investments play out in communities like the member for Leichhardt’s seat, because we are doing something the previous government were never prepared to do. They were either too lazy or it was too hard. They did not want to look at paying more for those communities that were truly remote. They were not prepared to update the demographic data. It has been a really hard job. We have consolidated more than 60 programs into five streams. That takes a lot of administrative work, but it means that we are now using a classification system that is consistent across a whole lot of other government programs. It means that doctors can easily find out what incentives are payable to them, and I think it will be of huge benefit not only to the Indigenous community but also to the whole community in Cairns.

This is a sign of what new investments, and reorientation, across the health system can deliver to local communities. I particularly want to thank the member for Leichhardt, who has been a tireless advocate in making sure I was aware of the range of issues facing his community and making sure that we are addressing those various needs.

You would know and understand that most of the industry was relying on that 1.75 per cent indexation on the 8.75 per cent they are currently getting as a way to plan for the future and put some money back into the industry. Minister, you would be aware that the

                                               In contrast to the aged-care industry, the Commonwealth committed to a new national healthcare agreement with a more generous indexation of around 7.3 per cent per annum for hospitals, and yet aged care got nothing; it missed out on the indexation. We do know that part of the aged-care pension increase was quarantined for those residents living in aged care, but, over a four-year projection, those aged-care providers are still going to be missing out. And I would like to know from the minister tonight how, in this country, aged-care providers are going to deliver the optimum care for senior Australians—around seven to eight per cent of them living in aged care?

                                               In another area of concern, you would have been aware of the recent ABC program about the Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme. Clearly, according to the

                                               they should know that those complaints are going to be undertaken, that they are going to be investigated, and that a report will come back to the complainants.

                                               I would like to know, Minister, who makes the decision on which complaints are investigated? Because, certainly, that ABC report that night indicated that someone in an office decides whether or not a complaint is taken forward and is investigated. I think families in this country and, indeed, residents need to be assured that the Complaints Investigation Scheme that is in place does in fact undertake the duty that it is required to. I would like to know, Minister, that the funding for that body is in place, the steps you are going to take to ensure that the investigation teams do undertake investigation of complaints made by senior Australians in this country, and, indeed, their families so that they can be assured of the care that they are getting.

                                               I would also like to ask the minister a question regarding the beds that have been handed back. These beds are worth dollars. We do know, over the past 12 months, there have been beds that have been handed back to the department. I would like some assurance tonight that those beds that are handed back to the department will again be up for subscription in the next ACAR round; that we are not actually losing those beds to the industry. We do know there is a shortage of aged-care beds and, if those beds that are being handed back are not actually coming back into the system, how are we going to make up for those shortfalls around the country?

                                               <p>
                                                I thank the shadow minister for the array of questions that she asked, and I will certainly address each of those in detail. Let me start off by saying that the Rudd government is absolutely committed to providing aged and community care for our elderly Australians. Certainly we saw record funding when it comes to the sector in the budget—we are looking at $44 billion over the next four years, which is an increase of $2.5 billion over the four-year period.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                In 2009-2010, the government will provide a total of $9.9 billion to support the aged-care needs of our older Australians—9.9 per cent more than in 2008-2009. That is, indeed, a huge increase. Also, the budget will deliver an additional $728 million over the next four years, which includes an additional $14.8 million to increase viability supplements that the government pays to eligible residential aged-care providers in regional, rural and remote areas. This is very important—it is part of our ongoing commitment to support our older Australians, especially through our record funding.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                The shadow minister asked specifically, in relation to the conditional adjustment payment. The Rudd government is committed to retaining the conditional adjustment payment at the current level of 8.75 per cent on top of the basic residential care subsidy. Additionally, over the next four years, aged-care providers will receive $2.3 billion through this payment. As I said, a total of $14.8 million is being allocated to increase viability supplements, particularly for those in rural and regional areas. This brings total government funding for the viability supplement to $72.3 million over the next four years. As a result of the pension increase, which we see in the budget, our aged-care homes will receive $713 million over the next four years.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                I will now speak about the impact of the pension rise on aged care. Firstly, pensioners in aged care will benefit from the increased pension and will have more money for their incidental expenses—a total of $76.76 per week, which is an increase of almost 15 per cent on what they currently receive. As I said, our 2,830 nursing homes will receive an additional $713 million over the next four years to contribute to their running costs. This is extremely important when it comes to not only making sure that we are addressing the needs of the ongoing costs that are incurred by the aged-care providers but also ensuring that some of that pension increase flows on to those pensioners in our aged-care homes.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                Aged-care residents who are in care on 19 September 2009 and who are self-funded retirees or part-pensioners who have not benefited significantly from the pension rise will have their existing fee rates grandfathered until they leave care. For those entering care after that date and who do not get the benefit of the pension increase, arrangements are being put in place to give them time to adjust their financial affairs; however, it is fair that eventually everyone on the same income level will pay the same fees. Over four years their fees will gradually increase until they are paying 84 per cent of the pension.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                To ensure that aged-care homes receive the same level of income for all new residents entering care from 20 September 2009, a new, compensating government-funded aged-care supplement will be introduced. So the new standard resident contribution and the government supplement will start from 20 September 2009 and, as I said, deliver $713 million over four years in additional payments to aged-care providers, including the supplement, at a total cost to the government of $25.3 million.

                                                  The shadow minister asked a whole variety of questions. I am outlining the major amounts of record spending in this budget and I am more than happy to go into extensive detail. We have covered some of the areas: firstly, there is the conditional adjustment payments; and, secondly, when it comes to the pensions, I certainly want to be able to provide that detail.

                                                  The next point that the shadow minister raised was the stimulus package. Aged-care providers can access some measures in the package, in particular some of the climate change initiatives. May I remind the member that these were initiatives that the opposition voted against, so I find it quite remarkable that they have brought them up.

We are making that extra investment and we have not heard anything from those opposite about a 50 per cent increase in public hospitals. We have said that by 30 June we will have a report from our Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. I am looking forward to having that report, and we expect there are going to be a range of recommendations. We have seen the interim report.

We actually set up the health reform commission to provide us with advice, ideas and recommendations about what we will do into the future. We will look at it as well as at the performance in our public hospitals. We know that the

The new investments that are coming online do not immediately show in some of the data, which has lag time, and I am sure that the shadow minister understands that. We will be making some further statements in the coming weeks on the process that will be followed for us to make that decision, and no amount of yelling and screaming by the shadow minister opposite takes away from the fact that we have invested a record amount in public hospitals—something that they never did—and are delivering benefits by working with our state and territory colleagues.

It also showed that there was one GP for every 1,609 people in the Ipswich and West Moreton area, and that is going to be worse because Ipswich’s population is the fastest-growing in Queensland; it grew by 4.1 per cent last year according to the ABS figures. So the problem is becoming more acute and people are asking me questions about training places for doctors. Also, when can we expect the Ipswich GP superclinic to be rolled out?

The consultation and tender process has been completed. I understand that very shortly an announcement will be made for the preferred tenderer, so I think a contract is only days away from being signed and we look forward to being able to make that announcement with you. I know there was extraordinary interest in this in the community in Ipswich, with a large number of bids. I think that is an indication that there is a very active GP community but one that is ready to expand and which sees this as an opportunity to be able to perhaps provide some better training facilities for new, young graduates. Something that is obviously part of our key strategy behind the GP superclinics is how we use them to attract new graduates to areas of need.

                                                                That goes to the other question that was particularly raised. We have removed the cap that was in place, instituted by the previous government, that did not allow more than 600 graduates to train as GPs each year. When we have this incredible shortage across the country we know that we need to change that. We have a new and increased number of graduates coming on line in the coming years, and we need to make sure that it is attractive for them to go into primary care plus into regions where there are shortages. We have made the investments, which means there will be a 35 per cent increase in those GP training places in the coming years. I think that is going to be something that the community will welcome. We know that people become anxious if they cannot access doctors’ services, and one of the key ways for us to ensure that they can is to make sure that we train more of them. I think increasingly being able to train more people in primary care settings is going to be a valuable part of what we do.

One hundred and forty-six million dollars is going to Queensland to invest in emergency departments across the state. This is something which is helping our communities by making sure that we have both the primary care services funded through our GP superclinics and other strategies as well as our hospital services well resourced. I am sure that will be something that the member will watch closely, having been an active advocate in arguing for the superclinics. I look forward to shortly being able to make those announcements in his electorate.

                                                                 </a>
                                                                 and one is to the Minister for Ageing. I will address the minister for health first. Minister, you may or may not be aware that in November this year there will be visiting scientists and oncologists from Europe, the United States of America and Asia holding a conference in relation to the use of high-dose radiation and radio wave therapy. You are aware of a lady called Jenny Barlow who has been very active in this area and have met previously with one of her staff. Since that meeting, Mrs Barlow has spent much time overseas talking in various countries where research is being done and has been done, some of it government backed, such as the United States and countries in Europe and Asia. My question is: given that these scientists will be in the country at that particular period of time, would you meet with these people to discuss the latest innovations in these particular technologies for the treatment of cancer?
                                                                </p>

                                                                 My other question is to the Minister for Ageing. It is very brief and probably only needs a brief answer. Could you elaborate on the government’s current policy in relation to young people with disabilities who are currently housed in nursing homes? I think there are something like 5,000 or 6,000 young people who are inappropriately housed in the sense that they are in aged-care facilities but are not aged, just disabled. Does the government have any plans to expedite some of those arrangements, particularly in relation to the coordinated work between the Commonwealth and the states?

He has been a very persistent advocate on behalf of Jenny Barlow, who—I think largely in memory of her husband’s treatment—has been a persistent advocate for this particular type of treatment in Australia. The member is right that my staff have met with her and I think the department also has met with her. In Australia there is not currently any evidence or recommendation that this is an effective treatment for cancer. However, we are open-minded about any new sort of research or evidence. I was not aware that some international experts were coming to deal with this particular issue. I am certainly happy to undertake to the member to get advice about who is coming and make sure that you and your constituent have the opportunity to talk to the right people. It may be that if this is under the auspices in any way of Cancer Australia it would actually be preferable to meet with some of those people, but my office is certainly happy to be kept up to date.
                                                                 </p>

It includes $600 million for cancer drugs. It is something that we are very focused on as a government and of course we have to keep abreast of new developments. If research shows us that we can do things differently we need to be able to respond to that. I do need to just sound a word of warning because we have been down this track before with your constituent: currently in Australia there does not appear to be any evidence that this is an effective intervention. But we certainly are open-minded to any new research or international evidence that would change our position on that.

This has been an issue that this government has acted upon since we came into government 18 months ago. It is an issue of concern particularly for the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and also for the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services. They have certainly been working very hard at finding other means of moving a lot of our young and disabled people out of nursing homes and into other community settings. It is an issue that I know both of them have raised at many federal and state forums that have been held. It is one that we will continue to work on because you are absolutely right. In terms of young and disabled people we are looking at initiatives to have them in community based settings, and in particular not being in our residential care facilities which predominantly cater for frail older Australians. That is something that we have got a very strong commitment to work towards and I commend the parliamentary secretary for disabilities and the minister for families and community services for their very strong commitment in this particular area.

I know that it extends from the cities to the outback. In my own electorate the towns of Cunnamulla, Quilpie and Charleville—and I know, in the seat of Flynn, the towns of Longreach, Blackall, Barcaldine and Winton—are towns that I am aware of where ophthalmologists come out from the city and conduct this surgery on a Medicare fee-only basis. Given that most of these people out there are not privately insured if this is cut—as you propose—from $600 to $300 in November this year, I really feel that these doctors will no longer come out into those rural communities. It is a very real issue and I ask you reconsider that decision. I would see this not only as being able to give people sight again but also as a preventative health care measure because if people lose their sight or progressively become more impaired with their vision it does lead to the possibility of falls and a more extensive cost to the overall health budget.

It is something that is not going to go away and I think this should be seen more in the light of preventative health care as much as it is giving people back their sight. There is almost nothing more valuable than your sight.

I do think it is worth my taking you through some of the data. We are certainly happy to talk, as we are continuing to, with Dr Bill Glasson and other ophthalmologists who are putting forward different proposals about how we might still be able to make a significant saving, which we think is appropriate when the technology has changed so significantly, but also make sure that we protect regional communities.

Most of those services, even in remote communities—probably the member for Solomon would be aware, although it is outside his electorate, of the arrangements at

You used the figures of $600 and $300. The figures that we use are the cost when the measure would be introduced, which is $830, being reduced to $409—but proportionally, obviously, the point is the same. For the vast majority of these services, another $1,700 is paid by private health insurance funds for the hospital costs on top of the

What we are trying to ensure is that, when we are being constantly asked, as we should be, by the community to invest in new technology, new medicines, new breakthroughs—and that costs money—we are able to reap some return when medical technologies give us the ability to do some of these procedures in a cheaper or quicker way.
                                                                    </p>

I understand why the ophthalmologists do not like that; it is their income. But, ultimately, as the health minister, I have to make decisions on the best use of taxpayers’ money, and that needs to be targeted towards to delivering the best health services to people. I am not going to be in a position where the government and the taxpayer keep being asked to put new drugs, new technologies and new procedures into the healthcare budget and are never able to reap any benefit for savings that should be able to be recouped by the taxpayer.

It is why we have provided more than $800,000 for additional ophthalmology services through the medical specialist outreach program. You would be aware, I am sure, in your electorate of Maranoa that there are ophthalmologists who visit your electorate as a result of that. We have just made a commitment to add another $58.3 million to improve access to eye and ear health for

                                                                    </p>

The taxpayer is still paying the extra amount for a procedure which is no longer as time consuming, although, in many cases, it can still be complex.
                                                                    </p>

I am also happy to work with the ophthalmologists who have suggested that looking at a complex item for those procedures that are more difficult than the standard cataract procedure might also be a better way to balance things. I am not ashamed of trying to protect the taxpayers’ interest because it will allow us to invest in new technologies and new medicines as they become available, and that is something we need to be able to get our medical community to understand we have to keep doing over time.

In particular, one of the significant-sized communities that benefits from using modern classification and demographic data for the rural programs is Darwin—that was previously excluded from the last government’s classification structure. So now, for the first time, there is recognition that recruiting doctors to the capital of the
                                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

That is obvious to anybody sitting here, but unfortunately that was not recognised in the system before. So there is a great new incentive—in particular, maybe, for young doctors, who might see it as an exciting challenge—to go off and work in the Northern Territory, where there is a shortage of doctors. Not only will there be even more generous incentives paid to those in the remoter communities of the Northern Territory, there will, for the first time, be significant incentives paid to those who are relocating to Darwin as well.
                                                                      </p>

One of the most exciting commitments is $27.8 million to build a Northern Territory medical school. This is the first time there has ever been a commitment to a medical school in the Northern Territory—and it will be the first. Of course, when we talk about the difficulty of getting doctors to communities, we know that one of the best ways is to actually provide training on site, in a community—to get people to settle their lives there, meet their partners, know that they can live there and enjoy the life and provide services to this fast-growing community of Darwin. That is going to be a very exciting opportunity. Instead of medical students—young people from the Northern Territory who want to be doctors—having to go off and complete their degrees in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney or Perth, they will be able to do a whole degree in the Northern Territory, and that will deliver very significant benefits long into the future.

Again, I do not think it is hard for people to understand how important this will be in the member for Solomon’s electorate, where so many people need to travel to Darwin—to travel quite long distances, often quite a significant distance away from their families and communities—to have services that can only be provided at the hospital. And building 50 extra units where families can stay to be near their loved ones who need hospital treatment is going to have a very significant impact on the difficulty or ease with which people can access hospital services. We know this is a big issue for our Indigenous communities. But in a vast territory like the Northern Territory I think it is going to be particularly significant.

It has made us very aware of the particular issues in his communities, and we have been able to deliver, through the budget, for him.

I ask again: please, Minister, could you state one criterion by which you will assess whether or not the government has successfully fixed public hospitals by June 2009? Could you, in your answer, please include even just one benchmark and the figure of that benchmark by which you will assess the success or otherwise of your election commitment to fix hospitals by mid-2009?

But I do think it is disappointing that we have a multibillion dollar budget before the chamber at the moment and the shadow minister cannot ask a single question about that budget—not one question. I presume that that is because he is going to support everything that we are doing—that he supports our investments and our strategic saving. Of course he is not going to argue against the sorts of investments that we have made in the electorates of the member for Solomon—

On many occasions, I have heard you say that nurses are the backbone of our health system. These changes our government brings reinforce the vital role both practice nurses and midwives can play in the health system. Can you please outline how the government will recognise the valuable role and skills that these professions bring to the health system and to the broader community?

                                                                             I thank the member for Page for her questions. The Minister for Ageing might want to address the more general question in terms of ageing. I thank her for her support for the infrastructure investments that are being made in the community. When you look at the whole health budget, we know that some of these relatively small grants can have a huge impact in smaller communities. I think that the reworking of the rural infrastructure grants—a change from the previous budget, but being delivered and enhanced now through this budget—has been a success story that we have seen results from quite quickly. I am pleased to hear that that is welcome and I am always interested in how our election commitments are being implemented and rolled out. I think Lismore will have a great integrated cancer service. The commitment in this budget to provide funding for 10 regional cancer services allows flexibility for existing services to apply to be enhanced and to be best practice regional services or for brand new services to be provided and set up, particularly in areas where there is a lot of unmet need.
                                                                            </p>

Some confidential consultations are going on at the moment with some specialists and stakeholders about the criteria in order to make sure that the process for the health and hospitals fund is clear. We need to make sure that areas of need are properly identified but that we can also back good services that are already up and running and want to be enhanced and developed further. I know, for example, that the member for Riverina has already put her hand up to say that Wagga would be a great place to enhance their services. Similarly, I hear what the member for Page is saying, but it will be a process whereby we ask the

It is important to recognise that very highly skilled midwives and nurse practitioners, who have masters degrees and, often, years and years of experience, have been prohibited from the full scope of their practice because of some of the funding arrangements provided by previous governments. We think this is an important step into providing women, in particular, with the choices that they deserve around birthing. We also know that we have a very strong birthing system in Australia and, by and large, a very safe system, and we need to make these changes carefully.
                                                                            </p>

It also ensures that we get the collaborative arrangements right so that midwives and nurses will have clear protocols for working with

I am very pleased to hear that it is being well-received in your electorate, and I look forward to working with those in the community to see this change brought about. I also look forward to continuing to work with the states and territories on a national maternity services plan, where we will be asking the states to make sure that options—for example, more extensive birthing centres rather than the traditional hospital settings—are expanded in a range of hospitals across the country. This is the start of a change which could be quite significant, but will take time—maybe decades. If we do not start now, though, we will not see that change—which will be a significant benefit to women, not just in Page but around the country.

                                                                              This government is very proud—as is the member for Page—with our record funding when it comes to aged care. $44 billion over the next four years shows our very strong commitment to making sure that we are providing services for our older Australians. Indeed, if we look at that $44 billion over the next four years we can see some of the increases. There is $713 million over four years, in terms of pension reform. There is also the increase in the viability supplement of $14.8 million, which will particularly assist those aged-care providers in regional, rural and remote areas. We are also committed to retaining the conditional adjustment payment at its current level of 8.75 per cent. This measure will see the aged-care providers receiving $2.3 billion. What we saw in this budget is this government’s continuous commitment to provide funding to the aged-care sector.
                                                                             </p>

                                                                              It also builds on the government’s many other commitments to aged care, particularly issues such as one of our election commitments: $300 million and zero-interest real loans to expand or build homes in areas of high need. We saw the first stage of that rolled out, which $150 million in zero-interest loans. It great to see around the country the number of homes that are underway. In fact, in the electorate of Longman the other day, I opened up the first home to be the beneficiary of the zero-interest loans, which was absolutely fantastic.
                                                                             </p>

                                                                              It also builds upon the government’s major election commitment, which was a commitment to transition-care places of $293 million over four years. Transition care is so vitally important in making sure that we can move people out of hospital settings and into more appropriate settings whilst they are recovering from their hospital stay. It has been great to see the number of people that have accessed this particular program around the country, and the success that that has had. I know from talking first hand to many people who have been through the transition-care program how it has really impacted on and affected their lives. It is great to see that there are thousands of people right across the nation that have used this program, which is also part of our ongoing commitment to making sure that older Australians are able to access all the care and services they need.
                                                                             </p>

In particular, the change to our continence aids payment scheme, which is really important to those people that receive and are part of this scheme. It gives them greater flexibility and access when it comes to accessing their continence aids.
                                                                             </p>
                                                                             <p>
                                                                              I would like to briefly touch on a couple of other budget measures because they are very important. The change to our continence aids payment scheme is really important to those people that are part of this scheme. It gives them greater flexibility when it comes to accessing their continence aids. This is really important. I had many people approach me with the concerns that they had over the previous system. We are giving people a lot more flexibility and choice when it comes to accessing all of the aids that they need.
                                                                             </p>
                                                                             <p>
                                                                              We also saw in the budget our ongoing commitment to palliative care, with $14.4 million over four years. What we have seen right throughout this budget—particularly when it comes to aged care—is this government’s ongoing commitment to providing services for our frail and our vulnerable older Australians right across the nation. We have 2,830 nursing homes with nearly 200,000 older Australians in them. I take this opportunity to commend the staff in those nursing homes right across the nation and the outstanding work that they do.

I cannot help it that, through tactics, you cannot make this a question to ask during question time. This is an opportunity to ask questions about the budget. The relevant issue relating to elective surgery, which was in fact in last year’s budget, is the $600 million investment. This is the first time a Commonwealth government ever put money into elective surgery, which delivered more than 40,000 extra procedures. The shadow minister is embarrassed by this because he never did anything. As the Assistant Treasurer, he never lifted a finger to put more money into health, and now he is here with a multibillion dollar health budget and he cannot ask a question about it.

Nor has he provided any justification for the significant taxpayer expenditure that will inevitably be incurred, and has already been incurred, in order to pursue this ego-driven ambition of the Prime Minister, no doubt as part of his job application for the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations.
                                                                                   </p>

He then argued that Australia could be more fully engaged with the United Nations, but he did not make clear how that would specifically assist Australia. At a press conference on 30 March the Prime Minister gave what is apparently his only attempt to justify this pursuit of a seat on the Security Council in these terms:
                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                   </p>

Turning to this year’s budget papers, the government said, in language little more understandable:
                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                   </p>

More specifically: what is the cost of the government’s pursuit of a seat on the Security Council? I do not just mean the direct cost of $11.2 million set out in the budget papers, but all of the costs, direct and indirect, that will be incurred between the budget and the year of the vote prior to 2013-14.

In other words, it is seeking to change long-held foreign policy positions in order to win this seat on the Security Council—indeed, compromise long-held foreign policy positions. So my question is also in relation to the $1.6 million in development aid to Thailand that has been diverted to ‘other priority areas’. I ask the parliamentary secretary: what are those ‘other priority areas’ to which the $1.6 million in aid to Thailand has been diverted? That is under part 2, expense measures. My first round of questions to the parliamentary secretary relates to the government’s justification; the cost—direct and indirect—in relation to the Security Council bid; and, specifically, the redirection of $1.6 million from Thailand.

So it is a stunningly timid proposition that somehow Australia alone amongst developed countries is not one that should seek to be elected—that we should shrink away from being part of the international effort about global peace and security and cower away in fear in case somebody asks us a hard question. No previous Australian government has ever had that view. I do not criticise the Howard government for not persisting with their view. They had their reasons at the time. I am not sure whether I would have done it or not at the time because I do not know all the facts that they would have had access to that we in opposition did not have access to. But they did not say that the Security Council was an inappropriate place for Australia to be or that there was no role for us or for our voice to be heard in the world.

We are committed to making a substantial contribution to global peace and security—a modest one. We are not the biggest country in the world, but we are not the smallest. We are about the 12th largest economy in the world. We are on the G20. We ought to be capable of discharging the reasonable obligations that all developed countries have and of making a useful contribution. But, more particularly, we ought be able, like other countries seek to do—and which is one of the primary purposes of diplomacy—to shape global responses to our interests; to influence international approaches in ways that serve Australia’s interests. That is why we have diplomats. That is why we have a foreign policy. It is about contributing to global peace and security and about trying to shape solutions in ways that serve our national interest and also that bring the interests of our region onto the international stage.

We intend it to be targeted and cost effective. The budget does not make any provision for the final two years. The funding for the final two years will be considered in the 2011-12 budget context. But we do not expect this to be a massive expenditure. We have committed $13.1 million from 2008-09 and we will outline what the final two years will cost in the 2011-12 budget context.

We do not actually have a bilateral program with Thailand, so I am not quite sure what the $1.6 million is. I am just checking. I am aware there is something in the budget paper. I will get back to the shadow minister in just a moment on that.

I would like to table a document in relation to Zimbabwe, in particular in relation to Australian government policy relating to Zimbabwe. I have a report written by Andrew Macpherson, who the parliamentary secretary has met before. He has done extensive aid, agriculture and food production work in various parts of the world, but particularly in Africa. I will seek leave in a moment to table the report that he has made to me.
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                          He has recently been in Zimbabwe. He has been a resident of Harare for something like 18 to 20 years. He is currently living in Armidale, frequently travelling back to parts of Africa. He still has a home in Zimbabwe with his wife, who has been involved in a lot of international education programs as well with African students coming to Australia. The issue that he raised, which I would like the minister and the parliamentary secretary to take on board, is the foreign policy initiatives in relation to Zimbabwe’s government of national unity. He met with some of the ministers of the current government and also with the Australian ambassador. There seems to be a view—and it is a view that I hold in a sense—to do with Australia, because of Mugabe and the games that have been played over the years and the way in which the Mugabe government has really thumbed its nose at the international community much to the detriment of the people who actually live in Zimbabwe. There is a feeling coming through particularly from the

There is a feeling coming through in this document that I have here that would suggest that if we leave Zimbabwe out in the cold that will in fact play into the hands of the Mugabe thugs into the future. So I will table this document for the minister and the parliamentary secretary to look at. I think it is a good account of someone who has lived in that country, knows the agricultural scene in that country and the way in which people relate and knows of the efforts that are going on in terms of the government of national unity to improve that country.

                                                                                          I thank the House. The other issue that I raise briefly is Australia’s foreign policy role in assisting agricultural production particularly in Africa. I know that, for example, Sudan, in these times when we are talking about food security, has the potential, because of its very extensive and magnificent dryland soils—and they are dry but Australia has dry soils as well—to produce six times the food that Australia produces. With the climate change debate, in particular the carbon footprint debate that is going to be going on, I think Australia will have to play a much greater role in assisting countries like Sudan—and I know there are political issues as to a place like Sudan—to come to grips with food production in their own countries rather than our having the transportation of food all over the world under some sort of artificial market in which many of the players cannot afford to pay for the food anyway—and with a carbon tax on top of that we do not know what that will all actually mean. So I would invite the parliamentary secretary to address those two issues.

As far as I can tell at the moment—and if there is any further information on this I will get it and send it to the shadow minister—this was an internal reprioritisation by ACIAR. There has certainly been no decision by me that required them to do it and I am not aware of any government directive or policy priority from us to ACIAR saying this is to be a reprioritisation. As far as I can tell, it was an internal reprioritisation by ACIAR. But if there is anything further I will check and I will let the shadow minister know.

I do not have enough time to respond in, probably, all the length they warrant. I agree with him on both points. The Australian government has cautiously started to move on this. The international community is generally looking at this question of how to move from the exclusively humanitarian assistance that we provided in the Mugabe period so that we could be confident no money was, or was in any way seen to be, supporting that regime to being more open with the new government, even though there is some risk because, as Tsvangirai himself has said, the new government is not actually working in every way that we would wish and the risk of

We are looking to find ways in which we can move beyond humanitarian assistance to support efforts by the inclusive government to restore basic services, particularly in an area that is one in which the Tsvangirai party ministers, the

It is a finely balanced argument to move forward sufficiently strongly to give encouragement and to show to the people of Zimbabwe that things are better and that there are benefits that flow—and some of that is evident on the ground in Zimbabwe, as I am advised—without running the risk that the money is supporting things that no Australian would want to see their taxpayer dollars go to. So you are right: the balance is shifting towards moving beyond the pure humanitarian, towards service delivery. We will proceed very carefully and cautiously, but we are moving in that direction. You are right. If you are reflecting your friend’s contribution, he is correct.
                                                                                          </p>

It is one of the major initiatives globally. Australia and most other donors have reduced their support for agriculture too far, and we are starting to reverse that progress. It is a very complex question, and there is a lot of detail in the budget papers, and if the member wants any more I will get it for him. To summarise it, if you look at the wonderful, generous Australian warm-hearted response when starving kids appear on television, what we are doing about agricultural production is trying to stop the kids starving in the first place. It is a program to say, ‘Let’s get the food grown and delivered in the region, in the countries concerned, so that people can be more successful.’ Australia has a particular role to play, firstly in research and, going back to the shadow minister’s question, in ACIAR. ACIAR has this specialist role not just in Africa, but around the world. It is of dual benefit, to developing countries’ farmers and to Australian farmers. That research is a doubly beneficial event. It also helps people because of the compatibility of our soils and climates. We have a unique capacity amongst donors to make a contribution, and we certainly intend to do so.

The point is that this government has not provided any rationale, any justification, for it. Excuse the cynicism, but no other government has otherwise gone against longstanding support for Israel in the way that this government did last year. The Rudd government voted in favour of two anti-Israel motions in the United Nations in 2008. It was very slow to withdraw its support for the

The fact that it left its decision to the day before the conference started so that no message could be sent to other nations—and indeed it did not even bother to tell the Australian Human Rights Commissioner that the government had decided to withdraw—leaves one very cynical about this government’s motives.

He will note that, in the budget papers, the government is providing $11.2 million over two years for the bid. Is further funding required beyond 2010-11? What funding will be required for 2011-12 and 2012-13? If further funding is required, why is it not included in the forward estimates?

Can that be taken into indirect costs, as well as the specific costs of the Governor-General’s trip to Africa, where she confirmed that it was part of her brief to specifically lobby African countries? Could we have those details as well?
                                                                                           </p>

There will of course always be many good reasons for directing aid to developing countries, but it would appear on the face of it that the Rudd government has been very cynical about the timing of its assistance. For example, under the banner of economic infrastructure, aid is $11.9 million in 2009-10, $22.3 million in 2010-11 and then there is a massive increase to $166.2 million in 2011-12 and up to $253.2 million in 2012-13. This huge increase occurs in the years of the United Nations Security Council vote and clearly the increase is timed to coincide with the Prime Minister’s bid for the Security Council seat. Quite frankly, if the countries need aid now, why is it not being provided now? Why is it being provided in four years time? Can the parliamentary secretary provide any other rational explanation for this back-end loading of this funding to coincide with the Security Council vote?
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>

There is a global financial crisis, as we are reminded on a daily basis by the Prime Minister. If overseas aid is required, surely it is required now. Why is the government back-ending this funding to these countries in 2011-12 in particular? I ask that the parliamentary secretary direct his answers to this back-end loading of development assistance and food security through regional development.

The first point is that international representatives of Australia see as part of their obligations pursuing the Australian government’s diplomatic objectives. That is a stunning revelation, that the Australian Ambassador to the Vatican regards as one of his tasks pursuing an Australian government diplomatic objective. What a surprise that must be to everybody! There would be people looking aghast and amazed. That is part of the responsibility of every international representative of every country and it is similarly the responsibility of our excellent ambassador to the Vatican. When the Governor-General travels, she delivers messages that are consistent with the policy of the Australian government. That has been the case ever since we have had governors-general. It is their appropriate role and will continue to be. Nothing will change, whomever is in government. That is a statement of the bleeding obvious.

Our overseas development budget overall is determined by two factors: one is the proportion of gross national income that we are committed to, which is increasing year by year; the other is our gross national income—that is, the budget is the multiplication of those two numbers. What percentage of

Because of the global financial crisis, the gross national income is not expected to increase very much for the next two years and so the aid budget will not increase very much. It is only because our percentage commitment is going up that it will increase at all.
                                                                                                  </p>

It would suit the government and me better if the increases were more steady. That is what we envisaged when we were elected and what we envisaged in last year’s budget, but the global economic crisis has meant that our gross national income has not increased as much as we anticipated. Therefore, the dollar value of our aid budget will not increase as much as we anticipated, so we will not be able to introduce the programs as quickly as we intended but, as the GNI percentage and GNI income goes up, our capacity to fund increases will be enhanced and that will be reflected in every part of the aid budget. You will see that same four-year profile everywhere. It is driven by arithmetic.

It was part of the reason for the ambassador taking up the position and for the Governor-General’s recent trip to Africa, where she visited a number of states—and we know there are about 53 votes in Africa. I would appreciate details of the costs and I am sure the government can attribute, particularly in the case of the Governor-General, how much of the trip was spent lobbying other countries.

There have been reports that about $500,000 has been spent on this further ego trip on the part of the Prime Minister. Would the parliamentary secretary provide me with how much money has been spent to date in relation to that—which would include Mr Richard Woolcott’s expenditure and whatever payment he has received. I specifically ask the parliamentary secretary: how many nations have given their unequivocal support to this venture? We do know that in the world of diplomacy people talk in the most polite language so as not to insult or offend but a number of officials have described this initiative as dead in the water. There has been considerable publicity about the very lukewarm, bordering on neutral, approach of virtually every country that has been contacted. So I would appreciate the government’s view on the number of nations and the names of those nations that have unequivocally supported this venture of the Prime Minister’s.

There is no increase in the funding and I was wondering whether this program was meeting its objectives. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could make some comment about the item of enhancing regional counterterrorism effectiveness, where there has been no increase at all in the funding.

With regard to the Prime Minister’s proposition concerning the Asia-Pacific community, there are no extra funds in this budget. Anything that is done will be met out of the existing resources of the department. There is not a specific allocation in this budget for that. I have not had a chance personally to discuss this with the special envoy, Mr Woolcott, but as I understand it the general view is that the proposal is proceeding about as well as we could expect and we remain positive about the prospects for that proposition. That is the situation as I understand it to date.

I do not have anything immediately before me; I will get that for her.

We have looked at the parameters of what is needed against the resources available and there is an envelope and a series of particular decisions that have been made about applications of it. There is of course some work underway but nothing that is at a level of finality that I, or the minister, am in a position to announce at this stage. But the money has been set aside to strengthen our engagement with some of those key countries. I look forward with some anticipation to the detail being made available. And I am looking forward with even more anticipation to the Minister for Trade arriving to deal with his particular issues!

The government is providing $3 million in 2009-10 to undertake a feasibility and planning study. Is the parliamentary secretary able to advise of the likely time frame of this feasibility study. What will be the basis for proceeding? What are the criteria for confirming that a new chancellery will proceed? And could you perhaps give us an indication as to the likely cost of such a construction, taking into account the particular circumstances, but also precedents where we have constructed new chancelleries from the outset.

That is the time frame but I cannot absolutely guarantee that it will be done in time for that because of the difficulties of working in Kabul. But that is the plan.

My question relates to the beef industry and exports, because that is a very big issue in my electorate. In my electorate we have a number of meatworks, including the biggest kangaroo meatworks at Wulkuraka. But there is beef production as well. There is a meatworks in the

It is part of the 121,000 workers who work in the beef industry in Australia. The continued production and distribution of beef exports is very important for my electorate of Blair. Thousands of families in my electorate rely upon contracts overseas, on our free trade agreements and on the multilateral agreements that we engage in with respect to South-East Asia. We export beef all across the world: to Muslim countries, to Europe, to Asia and to the Americas. It is always very important, Minister, that we ensure the free flow of trade. It is particularly important at this time of global financial crisis. Particularly with the global recession, the workers in my electorate of Blair very much want to know about the viability of the beef export industry.

Geographically, 95 per cent of my electorate is rural. They are very interested in this. Beef production is very important. The farms are mainly in south-east Queensland, but beef comes from all over Australia to Dinmore, where the workers slaughter the beasts and from there export them. Can you outline for me and for the benefit of my constituents the efforts that you are making and the efforts that the Cairns Group is making to secure outcomes so that we have a ready supply of export markets available?

In fact, there are significant reductions committed to if we can conclude the round. That is not to say that what that does is to give totally open opportunities in the European markets, for example. But we are keen to ensure that the flexibilities that remain for those countries in these negotiations do not result in further restrictions. To put it the other way, we are looking for flexibilities within the final settlement to increase quota access, for example.

The difficulty last year was in bridging the gap with the 20 per cent, and, quite frankly, the last six months have seen a stalling in progress at that level because of the US elections, the transition to the new government, the new US trade representative settling in, and the elections in India.

We have indicated that what we want, from an offensive point of view, is to secure improved market access and, obviously, we will pursue that in the context of the Korean free trade agreement. Korea is a very good example because, even though the US market has opened up, Australian market share is holding up really well. And that reflects the quality of the product.

There are two crucial aspects to us improving our trading position: (1) is opening up the markets, but (2) is having quality product and an efficiently produced product that can compete in those markets.

Will the federal government follow a similar path in relation to purchases? What plans does the government have to deal with New South Wales on this issue—or, for that matter, any other state that introduces these kinds of preference clauses?

I understand that the government is of the view that that will be sufficient to pay all the claims in full. The government had previously provided an extra $50 million for claims lodged in 2009-10 and, at additional estimates, the department advised that this was the amount the government estimated was needed to cover the changes which the government had made to the scheme for the grant year 2008-09. I guess this means that there will therefore be another $50 million shortfall for the payments made in 2009-10, assuming that there is the same level of activity in the grants scheme as has occurred in the past. So I ask: does the government propose to provide another backdated payment in the next budget to give the assurance to exporters that they will have their claims paid in full, and what will be the situation in the out years?

I have read newspaper reports; I have not seen the details. If, in fact, though, it is going to be an initiative that gives a price differential to Australian product of 20 per cent, we are opposed to that because that amounts to a tariff. We do not believe that government procurement mandated or price impacted is the correct way to go, and we will strongly resist it. Not only does it run the risk of being contrary to our trade obligations; it is clearly contrary to commitments that we, amongst G20 leaders, made at the G20 summit to resist the spread of protectionism in the context of the current global financial crisis.

I would have also thought that the 20 per cent price differential was an odd decision for the New South Wales government to be taking in the context of having to balance its budget, because clearly it is imposing an additional cost in there.

Too often people ignore the importance of trade being an ability to penetrate other markets and not just the export of product. We will wait and see what the full details are. I have written to the

What we have done in this budget is fund the shortfall that we inherited for this year, because this year is a reimbursement of costs incurred based on promises the previous government had made but never funded. When we came to office—and this goes to the second part of your question about the shortfall next year that was already covered in our last budget because we allocated $50 million for next year to reimburse the costs incurred this year based on the changes we made—we funded our proposals. We should not have to fund your failure. The fact still remains that in the context of this global financial crisis, where we understand the fundamental importance of securing market share because our exports have been holding up really well, we were not going to leave our exporters in the lurch. We secured in this budget an additional $50 million to cover your shortfall. So not only is this a hypocritical question but I think it highlights the fact that you as government paid lip service to the importance of exports but were never prepared to fund them. We will not let our exporters down; we will fund them.

I have already indicated to the industry that services export markets around the country that they are also going to have to come to grips with the thrust of the recommendations contained in the Mortimer review. We are going to put it on a solid footing going forward. We are going to do what you failed so miserably to do.

But, before you answer it, I would like to make some comments on the record about the protectionism issue and what you have commented on. When I looked at the figures—I got them from the then Northern Rivers Regional and Development Board, which has now merged with Regional Development Australia—I saw that about 19 per cent of jobs across my seat of Page were reliant somewhat on exports. Often people are quite surprised when they actually look at the figures and go through them region by region. That was just a basic rule-of-thumb measurement we did, but it showed that.
                                                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                                                       Last weekend, I visited Brookfarm, which is just a little bit outside my electorate. They are major exporters who, like a lot of people, started off small—one was a dentist, one was from the film industry. A lot of members here travel on Qantas; well, if you get muesli on those flights it comes from Brookfarm. Their product is really successful: macadamia muesli.
                                                                                                                      </p>

If we go down the protectionist path, we will close up access to the markets that we need. It is a two-way street. It is vital that the global financial crisis does not result in an increase in protectionism. We know that trade is part of the solution, not the problem. That was clearly demonstrated at the G20 leaders meeting.

So it is really important to have that access to export markets and not have protectionism. The report highlighted the danger of protectionism to Australian families and workers, and to producers.

I have spoken about it before in this place. It is something that is unfriendly and it takes them down the path of protectionism. There are some other signs of it but generally there is a commitment to combat it.

I know all of us say ‘shop locally’, ‘support our local producers’; we all do that. We have local producers markets. It is what we do to help. While some grow exclusively for the local market, a lot of those local producers grow not only for the local market but for the export market as well. There is a grower of orchids in Woodburn who exports them. You would not expect it—just small amounts of them, but he exports them. I have such producers right across the seat of Page.

It is a huge national event based on the beef industry. The Northern Co-operative Meat Company is also in Casino, which I know, Minister Crean, you have visited and I have visited many times with you. They employ over a thousand people and export to other markets. It is crucial that our efforts in support of our trade and investment priorities also attach themselves to this fight not to go down the protectionist path. So, Minister, my question is, simply: can you explain how the budget bolsters Australia’s diplomatic efforts in support of our trade and investment priorities, please?

That is one aspect of it. The second aspect of course is the EMDG, which I have just gone through—a commitment of $50 million to support reimbursement of costs associated with exporting opportunities. The third is the fact that we also funded in the budget an area of activity that I believe is going to be important in terms of export opportunities for the future, and that is clean energy and efficiency. The fourth area is the importance within the automotive industry package of our ability to integrate more effectively in terms of clean cars and clean technology and to position ourselves much better in the global supply chain.
                                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                                        Another area of activity that has increasingly been absorbed into Austrade’s activities is Invest Australia, the question of drawing investment to this country and in many senses understanding the importance of investment as the new form of trade—the two-way dimension of it.
                                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                                        So there is much in the budget that is being done to promote our export efforts. I am reminded by the honourable member’s reference to the importance of trade for jobs that the report that was put out by the Centre for International Economics shows that one in five jobs is trade related. It is important to understand that, of those roughly 2½ million jobs, 1.4 million are in export related activity and 1.1 million are in import related activity, in logistics, transport, retail. This is important to understand. When people talk of trade, we do not just mean exports. Our ability to take a cheaper component, convert it, value-add it and re-export the product is a significant factor in where Australia’s future lies, and all of those clean energy technologies are good cases in point in terms of that opportunity.
                                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                                        We understand the importance of trade not just to Australia’s economic future; we understand the importance of it in terms of job opportunities for Australians. That is why we have been prepared to make considerable commitment, in the last budget and in the previous budget, to lifting not just our export performance but our trade performance.
                                                                                                                       </p>

Can you give us some advice about the progress of those negotiations? I understand the last round of meetings was held from 24 to 26 February. Are you aware of progress in the GCC’s negotiations with other countries which might give us reason for concern about our car exports to that part of the world?

I ask the minister: what is the justification for recognising Vietnam’s market economy status? Were there any studies, reviews or detailed examinations which led you to the conclusion that this was indeed a genuine and open economy worthy of being granted such status? Will there be any antidumping cases lodged in relation to imports from Vietnam that could be affected by this change of status?

But, in any event, the commitment that we are seeking is that if they extend any entitlement in terms of preferential treatment then we would expect that to flow to us, and I have been very clear on that.

It is something in the order of $80 billion in two-way trade before this free trade agreement was struck. It has 600 million people and those countries, Vietnam and Indonesia included, are still growing. So these are opportunities for us to grab that market share, hence the need to invest in the Export Market Development Grants Scheme to help our companies get market share.

It is simple: because you got nothing in return. You negotiated a dud agreement. That is why, after having conceded the point about market economy status, the talks stalled. They got what they wanted and made no commitment to do anything else. Now you come and ask us if we are making progress. You have conceded the most significant point to them without getting a damn thing in return. There is a fundamental difference between our approaches; and not just to negotiations generally but to understanding the importance of getting a give and take concept—the fundamental concept of bargaining—which seemed to escape your previous government.

What we still have to break through with at the political level is the coordination mechanism within China itself. I believe the political will to conclude this agreement does exist. It is a political will that has been exchanged at the leadership level with our Prime Minister and their president and prime minister, as well as at the level of my engagement with the trade minister. I went to Beijing about six weeks ago and made it quite clear that we were not going to settle, in agriculture, for anything less than New Zealand and that they needed to understand that. Secondly, given the whole issue surrounding investment in this country, they needed to understand that investment was a two-way street and that we should also be developing a framework for facilitating investment flows between our two countries.

If we were to get the political signal, we would be there tomorrow to undertake the 14th round. This is the clear message that we have conveyed, and I am in regular contact with my counterpart in China. I am confident that we can conclude an agreement, but it is only going to happen if the political will is not only given but subsequently acted on.

It will have a very real effect on some industries that has to be acknowledged. For some industries, such as traders in the meat industry in particular, the effect will be much greater than it will be for others. I can mention one trader in Sydney with a turnover of some $50 million whose AQIS charges, counting the loss of the 40 per cent plus the increase in charges, look as if they will go from something like $60,000-odd to $600,000. I think you would agree that that is an enormous increase. This increase will affect everybody who has to export and use AQIS services, whether it be in horticulture, fisheries or any other commodity.

If so, where is that money coming from? If not, will he need to pass a new appropriation bill to provide that money? Has the minister threatened commodity groups that, unless he gets their agreement by the end of this week, he will take the deal off the table? Why is the minister unwilling, given that he has agreed to look at producing efficiencies within AQIS, to make the AQIS charges cheaper for exporters? Why is he unwilling to commence the efficiencies first and reduce the rebate as the efficiencies take place?

For parts of what he has raised, it will come as no surprise that I am not in a position to announce what has not yet been announced. Notwithstanding that, there are some issues in the public arena that he has referred to and I think it is important that I deal with those directly. The shadow minister referred to the government’s or my decision to end the 40 per cent export subsidy. The 40 per cent export subsidy was never established as a permanent system—never. When it was announced by the previous government it was always as an expiring program, and the expiry date ultimately for that program was the end of June this year. The decision that the government took was not whether or not to end the 40 per cent export subsidy; the decision was whether or not to keep to the program dates that had been put in place by the previous government. We made the decision, following the receipt of the Beale report, that we would keep those dates. Since that point there have been discussions with industry.

                                                                                                                              A great frustration that has existed all the way through on this is that, for $40 million a year each year over the past eight years or thereabouts, when you ask what reforms and what efficiencies we have to show for it, the answer is: not much at all.
                                                                                                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">

It is no surprise that that was my conclusion, given that when I became the minister Australia was in the middle of equine influenza, when the horse industry, which is certainly not the biggest agricultural industry, took a $1 billion hit. So I do understand, right at the coalface, exactly what it means to have inadequate biosecurity protections at the border. That was the basis of the original decision, and from the moment that decision was made we began talks with industry as to what we might be able to do to help drive efficiencies. Those discussions are continuing. I am hopeful that they will close very soon, but they have been continuing.

That would mean that the reform program that hopefully gets negotiated—though we are not there yet—would be in deeply serious jeopardy. The shadow minister also raised an issue of time lines, as to why I have been so determined to get all of this sorted out basically by deadlines that we are approaching in the course of this week. The reason for that is simple. I have no level of faith that the National Party would not move a disallowance as late as August or September next year. If they did so and if it were carried by the Senate we would be in the situation of having a massive hole in the quarantine budget and of not being able to perform the essential tasks of AQIS. For that reason I want to do everything that is possible, and hopefully it will be possible, to make sure that the new fees and charges are put on the table so that they are disallowable in the course of next week. I hope that we reached a landing point with industry that the opposition choose not to get in the way of. I hope that industry ends up happy enough with the reform project and that the opposition is willing to respect the views of industry. But, if they are not, I am not going to put Australia’s biosecurity at risk in a way that the opposition have been threatening.

Firstly, I want to thank you for the support you gave at the time of the floods in my area in Page in order to make sure that our farmers and small businesses got access to the $5,000 cash grants. My question is: how is the government supporting Australian farming families through the budget?

That is in the face of having received some of the best and some of the worst of what the weather and the climate have to offer.

There has been some mischief—I could use the word ‘mischief’, but I will not be so unkind—in the reporting and complaining about what has happened with forward appropriations on drought payments. I would like to take the opportunity that has been given to me by the member for Page to explain how it works. Essentially in this budget, with the exception of one change, it works the way it always has, which is that forward appropriations appear in the budget papers for EC payments to the extent that there are current declarations in place. Anything beyond that does not appear in the forward appropriations. That is the way the previous government handled EC, and that is the way we have continued to handle that in the way it is appropriated in the budget papers.
                                                                                                                               </p>

That is a change that was part of a

In terms of total dollar amounts for farmers, there is no change. There is no change in how that actually works. But there is a difference in the formalities of how that is recorded in the budget papers.
                                                                                                                               </p>

I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Riverina, whose farmers are probably doing it tougher than in almost any other part of the country. From the Riverina, through Sunraysia and down into the Riverland area, the irrigation drought has hit people in a way that previous droughts just have not. There have been particular difficulties there. But for much of the country, particularly the north of the country, there have been welcome rains. Some within the electorate of Page came all at once, in ways that were not necessarily so welcome. But areas like New England, and some areas throughout Queensland as well, are having some of the best seasons they have ever had. That means that, after the National Rural Advisory Council conducted their assessment, some areas have come out of EC. That means that those amounts do not appear in the forward appropriations anymore.
                                                                                                                               </p>

These are programs that get renewed from time to time. We have extended those for 12 months only. The reason we have extended them for 12 months only is that, in the hope that we can arrive with industry at a new drought policy, those programs are very likely to be replaced by a different suite of programs doing very similar work but possibly organised in a different fashion.

As part of that question, Minister, can the Nationals properly read the budget papers, have they embarrassed themselves by misreading the forward estimates and claiming $1 billion has been cut from the portfolio budget and should they go back and read the budget papers again and play a constructive role in discussing how to help cushion rural and regional Australia from the global recession? So I again ask you, Minister, could you please give to me and this House one billion reasons why the Nationals cannot add up?

I do not have the Treasury budget papers in front of me, but I will refer to the question that was asked of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s budget papers. The reason you have an unusual annotation that had not appeared in previous budget papers is that in the ordinary course those programs may well have been extended for a further four years. The reason for doing it for 12 months is purely in the context of a drought review which would, presuming we reach a landing place with industry, have a new suite of programs that would cover similar work.
                                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                                   In terms of the overall effort of making sure that we continue to provide the support in mental health, in EC payments and in financial counselling, there is no change for people in any of those, even though there are some different methods that appear in the budget papers. The level of support that was there last year and that was there the year before is there next year as well for people on EC.
                                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                                   Can I also add the guarantee—to repeat again here what I have said a number of times and has been stated as well by the Prime Minister—that as we look toward any future drought policy, and as we look towards trying to find a way of shifting from crisis management to risk management, the only way you can properly do that is by saying that those would be rules which would apply to the next drought, not to the current one. That is why, even under the proposals we are looking at for a potential new drought policy, we are not looking at and not canvassing any options which would change the rules from under people who are currently receiving EC assistance. Any changes are about trying to help people who are already off the EC prepare for the next drought. They are the sorts of principles that have guided everything within the drought reviews. That has been affirmed by me, affirmed by the Prime Minister and affirmed by all the agriculture ministers around Australia at ministerial council as well.

You have some of it in Treasury papers, some of it here. On the extra expenses that you have, there are a series of a expiring programs that do continue, although you will find that some of them appear in different parts of different budget papers.
                                                                                                                                    </p>

I have got used to the fact now that the day after any budget there will be a media release from whoever is the Leader of the Nationals and from whoever is the shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, saying, ‘This is a disaster for the bush.’ It will always be there. It will always be using the same set of arguments that could have been levelled at any of their previous budgets, based on accounting systems that are used. This budget is, indeed, no different.

There is no way in the world that anyone looking at it fairly could claim that there was a $1 billion cut. There were cuts and, at every point, I have been completely upfront about what those cuts were. Land and Water Australia was a real cut. It will be $13 million in the long term, and about half of that is because of the wind-up operations that we are currently involved with. There is a further cut of $3 million to the Rural Industries Research and

There is also a $3.4 million cut to the work of my own department. Those are real cuts and that does happen at a time when there is a collapse in government revenue across the forward estimates in the way that we have seen. But for those opposite to add that up and to claim that we are talking about a $1 billion cut is completely dishonest.

He is also welcome to say where the opposition would add $1 billion to the deficit for new spending programs that it would like to put in place.

If it goes that way then of course you will be right. So I guess you belittled us because we felt that you were knocking agriculture—despite the 22 per cent cut, which is pretty significant in itself. But you neglected to mention the fact that, at this point in time, Australia is the only country in the world that is proposing a scheme which would have anything like this effect on agriculture, whether or not it is actually included in the scheme. So, in effect, are you not saying that Australian agriculture is going to be affected by climate change—in other words, less rainfall, less moisture—and that, on top of that, you are going to add 22 per cent in cuts that are man-made when no other country in the world is doing that?

Modelling by definition is always going to have to involve particular assumptions. That is the nature of any modelling. It does not make the modelling worthless but it does limit the extent to which you can use the modelling as an accurate predictor of what will happen in the future. For both the RIRDC modelling and some of the ABARE modelling, I thought it was important to make it public as it has come to me, and I have made it public, including the documents that I tabled that I think you were making reference to in what you terribly referred to as a ‘dixer’ in question time that day.
                                                                                                                                          </p>

It is that there will be no behavioural change by farmers. The ABARE modelling that I have referred to about the impacts of climate change presumes that there will be no behavioural change from farmers. We know that is not true. In fairness, how do you model and take into account what the behavioural change will be? It is extraordinarily difficult to do so. I am not critical of the researchers for using those assumptions, but it is extraordinarily unlikely and would be completely inconsistent with what farmers in Australia have done throughout the generations. There will be adaptation. The RIRDC modelling includes that same assumption that there will be no behavioural change.
                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                           There is also a concept in some of that modelling as to whether you are looking at changes in input costs or changes at the processing level, and the most extreme projections—the ones that we have both referred to at different points, because I thought it was important to put it out there, and no doubt once I put it out there you found it helpful for a series of other arguments—presume that 100 per cent of the increase in input costs is borne by farmers and 100 per cent of the downstream costs are also borne by farmers. That presumes not only that there is no behavioural change on farms but also that there is no behavioural change at any point of the value chain. It then also presumes that every one of those charges gets passed back to farmers. That part of it is often true—to a large extent, prices do get passed back to farmers. But, as to the presumption there will be no behavioural change at any point along the value chain, I have to say I just do not believe that. It is completely inconsistent with everything that I have ever seen.

The answer is yes. The guarantee that was sought for people who are currently on EC remains there as a guarantee, unchanged.

There were a number of expiring programs that made up the billion dollar figure that the shadow minister was complaining about the day after the budget. One of those was the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. I have to say I have had no-one, including from the forestry sector, argue that that was anything other than a terminating program. Another related to the Murray-Darling Basin irrigation management grants, which we actually extended beyond their original termination dates. We kept extending those and I have had no-one argue that this is anything other than reasonable. Finally, a large part of that billion dollar figure was the termination of the Dairy Adjustment Levy. The Dairy Adjustment Levy was not just an expiring program; it was an expiring program for which we put special legislation through to deal with the wind-up earlier this year, and it went unanimously through the parliament. If the National Party want to argue that there are $1 billion of cuts to agriculture, all but $20 million of that are cuts that they supported.

This was as a result of a question without notice to you on Thursday, 14 May. In your response to that question, you indicated that the method was identical, but then this evening you indicated that there are some differences to the way we did it. On Thursday, 14 May, you made a statement with quite an impact about the Nationals and the people on this side, saying the way of doing forward estimates was identical—identical—but this evening you have made the statement, ‘Well, it does differ.’ What is the truth?

The thing that is absolutely identical about the way the forward estimates are dealt with is that the forward estimates only show current drought declarations—current EC declarations. That is absolutely identical. The thing that is different is that some of those payments appear in a different set of budget papers to where they used to appear. But the way in which those figures are calculated is absolutely identical.
                                                                                                                                               </p>

The comment the Prime Minister and I have consistently made with respect to any new drought policy is that we are talking about continuing the current system for current recipients for the duration of the current drought. Now, we all wish the current drought had expired well in advance of current EC declarations. The likelihood of that happening nationwide is at best remote. In all the discussions we have been having with industry we do so on the basis that there will continue to be a National Rural Advisory Council and that, for existing drought declared areas, it will continue to assess whether those declarations need to be extended or not. That is the basis on which we have been operating.
                                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                                That is why we have legislation before the House of Representatives right now which deals with allowing me to extend the terms of the current members of the National Rural Advisory Council. If we were ending drought declarations, I would not need to do that. The fact that that legislation is in the parliament at all should be taken as a very strong show of good faith that we are working on the basis that, for the current drought, the current system is in place. But we do not want to wait for the next drought, for areas that have already come out—wait for the crisis—before the government get involved. Now, these are difficult budgetary times to try and work through those issues, but the conversations we have been having with industry are on the basis that we want to try to find a way of working through those issues. But nothing should be read into the current expiry dates for drought declarations. The intention of the government remains that the National Rural Advisory Council would provide recommendations to me on any existing declarations as to whether or not they ought to be extended. So that is the basis of that.

I know he is very strongly engaged with them. I am reminded that, at the time of the last election, when he was campaigning, he had to deal with a scare campaign, not claiming that we would cut billions of dollars from agriculture but claiming that we would shut down the live export industry. That says something about what you can expect from National Party scare campaigns, given that we have now opened more markets than the previous government.

The agricultural sector and tourism industry in the North are obviously at risk from climate change. I am interested in the responses, particularly the reef rescue program. I notice the strong representation from the agricultural sector on our side of the House. We do have a couple of people from the National Party here this evening, but there is nobody from Queensland, which is very disappointing. It is supposedly the home of the National Party, but there is nobody from the National Party in Queensland here to ask questions of the minister fro agriculture. I think it is very important to get that on the record. Minister, I would appreciate your response on climate change—an issue I know the National Party is very passionate about.

Where will that land use change take place and how? What is the actual definition of marginal land that you were referring to when you stated: ‘Our advice has always been that we’d be looking at marginal land’? Could you tell us which maps you are using to define marginal land? In answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, you indicated that he did not know what he was talking about, yet your own indication seems to be that your definition of marginal land is not the same as ours.

With respect to the member for Leichhardt and the member for Lyons, can you please be a bit patient because I want to deal with that last question from the shadow minister first. Given that I have never in my life stood in the parliament and been asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition, I can only guess that the question to which he was referring was a question which was about the Leader of the Opposition rather than one being asked by him. But should the tactics committee of the opposition decide that it becomes the role of the Leader of the Opposition to ask questions of me, I will be happy to answer them. I do not seem to get too many from the shadow minister. So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a go, that would be tremendous.
                                                                                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                                                                     Certainly any of the projections and any of the concepts of land-use change go not only to examples such as those on some grazing land where along the boundaries of pastures there can be limited strategic tree plantings but also to changes in land use in terms of what can be done with the quality of permanent pasture. Some of these issues go to where we end up post Copenhagen as well in terms of the Australian negotiating strategy of being able to separate emissions which are caused by human intervention from emissions which are caused by natural causes. If we are successful in that, it becomes far easier to come up with efficient methods of being allowed to give farmers full credit for the carbon that they sequester in the soil. So there are a few questions that come off the back of that—but which are of themselves examples of land use and land-use change.
                                                                                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                                                                     I will give a really simple example of a farm that I visited in the electorate of Corangamite about two months ago when the member for Corangamite took me out there. They have done some limited farm forestry on that farm. They have reorganised their paddocks, put farm forestry down the boundaries and provided increased shading for their stock. In doing so they have taken up a reasonable percentage of their land but with no reduction in their stock numbers at all. If done strategically and if done the right way, there is significant potential to get the right match of being able to improve the carbon sequestration in the soil through limited farm forestry while simply making your pastures more productive than ever. It is better for the stock because the stock are then able to access shade in ways that they were not otherwise able to previously, and stock numbers do not necessarily have to decrease at all. That sort of thing on the margins of grazing land is something that can be done—where you marry an improvement in productivity of the land that remains as pasture with farm forestry strategically placed around those boundaries. Those sorts of outcomes are significant land-use changes but land-use changes that result in significant improvements in productivity.
                                                                                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                                                                     There is an alternative path, of course, and the alternative path is to rip out sugar cane from land and whack some trees onto it. That is not the government’s approach—although from time to time there have been some members of the opposition who appeared to have thought that having a scheme where everyone is a winner but there is just less to eat is a more favourable option than what our perspective would be. That sort of land-use change is not one that we, at any point, have contemplated. There is a great story to tell in response to the issues raised by the member for Leichhardt about Reef Rescue. Reef Rescue is now at a point where we are getting significant involvement—there is a figure in the many hundreds of farmers along the north coast of Queensland in the areas adjacent to and flowing onto the

Farmers and farm organisations, whether they be in cattle or in sugar cane in particular, have become very much involved in the Reef Rescue program under Caring for our Country. Once again they are doing the right thing by the environment and improving their productivity on the way through. It is those sorts of outcomes that we are trying to drive through Caring for our Country.
