       <p>
        I am so proud to rise today to discuss the people of Chisholm, who are dedicated and committed to our community. First, I would like to recognise dynamic volunteer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Taylor
        </a>
        , who is the chairperson of the Amaroo Neighbourhood Centre. Margaret is one of those Australians who passionately and genuinely cares for their community and action proactive and constructive initiatives. For example, Margaret did a fantastic job in setting up and coordinating a crime and safety community open forum, where members of the Chisholm community could voice their concerns about local safety and rising crime rates and then have experts provide expert advice. The forum was held in conjunction with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        , where the community audience heard the expert advice from Monash Crime Prevention Officer James Egan and Senior Sergeant Peter Arnold from the Mt Waverley Police Station.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also had the pleasure of meeting Graeme Hanson, director of Box Hill South
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        , and Judith Clancy, Gwenda Smythe and Brett Smart from Neighbourhood Watch. Their passionate and genuine work for the community always goes above and beyond. With Judith's amazing baking and organisational skills, I had the pleasure of attending a morning tea which was organised as part of the Biggest Morning Tea program, designed to raise funds for medical research. Such goodwill and good spirit is constantly at play in the heart of Chisholm morning, noon and night thanks to the wonderful people who care for our community and their fellow Australians.
