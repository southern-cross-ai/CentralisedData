        In June, we acknowledge Bowel Cancer Awareness Month. This annual initiative of Bowel Cancer Australia raises public awareness of a disease that claims the lives of approximately 80 Australians each week. In February, Bowel Cancer Australia ran an initiative titled, Prevent Bowel Cancer to raise awareness of Bowel Cancer and encourage more Australians to screen for the disease, with the tag line, 'Don't wait until it's too late.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Bowel Cancer is the second most common type of newly diagnosed cancer in Australia, affecting both men and women. It is Australia's second biggest cancer killer after lung cancer. Tragically, Australia has one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world. The lifetime risk of developing bowel cancer before the age of 75 is approximately one in 19 for men, and one in 28 for women. Whilst approximately 80 Australians die each week from bowel cancer, if diagnosed early it is one of the most curable types of cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eighty per cent of cases have no known hereditary genetic associations, yet for some families the tragedy of bowel cancer repeats through generations. My father-in-law Kevin was only 55 years old when he lost his battle; my sister Kerry was only 39 years old. Watching a loved one struggle to beat this disease is heart-breaking. Kerry was in her prime at 39 with a successful career and future aspirations. In Kerry's situation, the period of time from feeling unwell, diagnosis, surgery and chemo, until she lost her brave battle, was only three months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Young Central Coast resident Hollie Fielder was 24 when she was diagnosed with bowel and secondary liver cancer. At such a young age, Hollie never thought that for one minute she may have bowel cancer. After living with severe stomach cramps and bloating for two years, Hollie was diagnosed with bowel cancer and advised that she had a five per cent chance of survival. Hollie was given the all-clear in December 2012. I had the privilege of recently speaking with Hollie about her commitment to raising awareness of bowel cancer screening. Since her treatment, this inspirational young women has worked with Bowel Cancer Australia and is one of the faces of the 'You are never too young' campaign. Hollie was recently quoted in the
        <i>
         Central Coast Express Advocate
        </i>
        as saying, 'I'm trying to put bowel cancer on the radar as I feel that a lot of people get embarrassed about talking about it and consider it to be an older person's disease.' Hollie and I discussed the challenges of removing the perceived embarrassment element of the screening process, and we both agreed that open discussion of bowel cancer should be encouraged within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Bowel Cancer Australia, the majority of young Australians diagnosed with bowel cancer are seeking diagnosis too late. Bowel cancer rates doubled in young Australians aged 20 to 29 and have increased 35 per cent in 30- to 39-year-olds in the period 1990 to 2010. This disease does not discriminate and symptoms should not be ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bowel Cancer Awareness Month has a positive message: saving lives through early detection. While those who have a first degree relative who has been afflicted with bowel cancer are more likely to be aware of the importance of screening. But it is important to note that this accounts for approximately only 20 per cent of cases. Therefore it is important that more Australians be aware of the screening options available and, of course, the symptoms. Australians should also be aware that a number of things, including smoking, high alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, obesity and type
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        diabetes are increasingly recognised as independent risk factors for bowel cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Screening using a non-invasive test is available through the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, introduced in 2006, is helping to save lives every day. The program provides free screening for bowel cancer to eligible Australians, and plans to expand the program are currently underway. By 2020, all Australians aged between 50 and 74 years of age will be offered free screening every two years. This means that about four million Australians will be invited to screen each year, and more than 12,000 suspected or confirmed cancers will be detected each year. According to the Bowel Cancer Australia atlas, for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyong_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Wyong Shire
        </a>
        within the electorate of Dobell in the period 2011-12, of those eligible for screening, 30.6 per cent of males and 35 per cent of females participated. So the challenge is to increase the number of participants. Of screened participants, 7.1 per cent were positively detected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without the support of many individuals and organisations that raise funds and awareness, Bowel Cancer Awareness Month and the work of Bowel Cancer Australia would not be possible, and to you all: thank you on behalf of all Australians.

            <p>
             I would like to congratulate the member for Dobell on bringing this motion to the House. It is a motion that I think is very close to the hearts of many people. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may notice that the member for Dobell and I are both wearing bracelets that have been made just for bowel cancer month because the colours of red and green, the colours of the apple, are the colours that signify bowel cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bowel cancer is one of those diseases that hits people from all walks of life. The member for Dobell has shared her personal experiences with the House today. My father died of bowel cancer before he was 55 years of age. Also, previously I had an elected officer who worked in my office whose daughter, aged 33, succumbed to bowel cancer. So it is a disease that affects people of all ages. It is also a disease that is very silent in its early stages. In Australia the lifetime risk of developing bowel cancer before the age of 75 is around one in 19 for men and one in 28 for women. That is one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world. Eighty Australians die each week from bowel cancer. And it is one of the most curable types of cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last week I had a Biggest Morning Tea. Out of the 140 people in that room, there were a number who had had bowel cancer in the past. I would like to share the story of Shaun. Shaun had had the bowel cancer screening test; he had sent it away. He received a letter back saying, 'Go and see your doctor.' He saw his doctor and he had the cancer removed and it was all contained within the bowel. Consequently, he has not needed to undergo chemotherapy or ray treatment, and his doctor has deemed that he is completely cured.
            </p>
            <p>
             This demonstrates the importance of undergoing screening. Screening is the best way to ensure that you do not have bowel cancer. The screening test is free for people aged between 50 and 74. I strongly recommend that people undertake the test.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of us, as members of parliament, need to go back to our electorates and publicise the fact that bowel cancer is curable. It is one of the most curable cancers there is. There needs to be more awareness amongst people. People need to be checked regularly for screening and, for people who have a family history, they need to undergo a colonoscopy. My sister and I both have regular colonoscopies. On every occasion bar one, I have had polyps—and my sister had polyps too. It shows that they were removed100 per cent; no problems whatsoever. I am sure the member for Dobell needs to have a similar test to me, because it is only by screening and making sure that you do not have those polyps that you can ensure good bowel health.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many risk factors, and the member for Dobell mentioned them: family history, which I just concentrated on; being aged over 50 years of age—but, once again, do not discount the fact that you can develop bowel cancer prior to that age; any bowel diseases—if in the past, you have had close relatives with bowel diseases, 75 per cent of cancers though do not relate to family history. Just because no-one in your family has had bowel cancer, do not believe that you are free from developing it. Make sure that you lead a healthy lifestyle, look for symptoms such as bleeding and undertake screening when it becomes available to you.

             <p>
              I would also like to congratulate my good friend and colleague the member for Dobell for bringing this motion to the House.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fifteen years ago, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is relatively rare with rates of about 13.5 per 100,000 people per year. It requires a biopsy to diagnose and, often in its early stages, there are no symptoms. When symptoms do occur though, they often include conditions which are similar to the common cold.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, bowel cancer is a very different beast. It is more common and much more dangerous. The bowel cancer occurrence rates are higher and, unfortunately, survival rates are a lot lower. The flip side is that, compared to thyroid cancer or almost any other cancer, bowel cancer is so much easier to screen for. Leading a healthy lifestyle can go a long way towards preventing it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most people who develop bowel cancer have no family history of the disease and, as we have heard, the cancer can form without any symptoms. As I said earlier, I would like to thank the member for Dobell for bringing this motion to the House to provide me and others an opportunity to rise here today to raise the awareness of bowel cancer and to encourage people to get screened for it. As the member for Shortland has said: we want to encourage anyone over the age of 50 to take up the opportunity to have the free screening, because it is available. We know that prevention is better than the cure.
             </p>
             <p>
              Government research suggests that, if everyone between 50 and 74 were screened for bowel cancer every two years, 35,000 lives could be saved over the next 40 years. That is something that I think is worthwhile investing in. Our national road toll is around 1,000 people per year, and so think of all the effort that goes into reducing that number—the road upgrades and the redesigns; the cars; the public education campaigns; law enforcement registration; and compliance checks. We can nearly save as many lives by having everyone between the age of 50 and 74 give a few moments of their time to do a simple screen test in the privacy of their own home once every two years. So it is important for everyone, even outside this age group—and we have heard the other speakers say that—to know the signs and the symptoms.
             </p>
             <p>
              When we were talking about this motion in my office, one of the staff said that when he was in his early 20s his partner at the time had a serious health issue. She had abdominal bloating, she had bowel issues and she had fatigue. This dragged on for a few years. They did not know it at that time but all of those were signs of bowel cancer. Not many 21-year-olds know that these are the symptoms of bowel cancer. They went to the doctor and, unfortunately, she was diagnosed with bowel cancer.
             </p>
             <p>
              The message from that is that it is really important that everyone knows that if you have blood in your bowel movements, if you are feeling anaemic, if you have changes in your bowel activity, if you have abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, unexplained weight loss and unexplained fatigue, they are all symptoms of bowel cancer and you should make an appointment with your doctor. Do not be alarmed. Just make an appointment with your doctor, explain the symptoms and, if in doubt, ask about bowel cancer.
             </p>
             <p>
              The young woman that I just mentioned did have a tumour the size of a golf ball removed from her large intestine, and it was major surgery for a 21-year-old. The recovery period was quite intense. She had a follow-up course of chemotherapy and now, ten years later, she has the best health that she has ever had.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bowel cancer can be a killer. But with simple screening it can be diagnosed early and with early diagnosis 90 per cent of cancers can successfully be treated. I would like to publicly acknowledge the excellent work of

               I too would like to use this opportunity to thank the member for Dobell for bringing this motion to the attention of the House. It is a particularly important issue. I think that all of the speakers have mentioned that the level of awareness is relatively low across the Australian community. So I commend the member for bringing this motion before us.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an ambassador for ovarian cancer, I know that we have had challenges in raising awareness about the symptoms of ovarian cancer over the years since I was appointed ambassador. In some ways, like bowel cancer, the symptoms are invisible or they get associated with some other disease. One of the symptoms of ovarian cancer is abdominal bloating and abdominal pain, and that can be associated with so many other illnesses. So the fact that we are having this conversation in the House on this issue is particularly important and, again, I commend the member for bringing it to our attention because, for a cancer that claims nearly 4,000 lives every year, it is not a cancer that we hear enough about. I welcome this motion so that the parliament can recognise and raise awareness of the illness.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
                Bowel Cancer
               </a>
               Australia, bowel cancer is a malignant growth that develops most commonly in the lining of the large bowel. Most bowel cancers develop from tiny growths called polyps. Over time, some polyps can become cancerous, and cancer can narrow and block the bowel or cause bleeding. In more advanced cases, the cancer can spread beyond the bowel to other organs. As most bowel cancers start as polyps, all polyps should be removed to reduce the risk of developing the disease. Once removed from the bowel, the polyp can no longer develop into cancer. Even if a polyp develops into cancer, in its early stages it can be cured by surgery. In fact, when found early—and this is a really important message that we need to send and, again, this is why I commend the member for bringing it to our attention—90 per cent of bowel cancer cases can be successfully treated. That is a very profound and powerful figure. It is so important to catch this cancer in its early stages.
              </p>
              <p>
               In February this year, Bowel Cancer Australia ran a campaign to raise awareness of bowel cancer and encourage more Australians to screen for the disease with the tagline 'Don't wait until it's too late', particularly given those success rates if it is caught early. That is why the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program is so important, offering Australians turning 50, 55, 60 or 65 a free at home bowel cancer test and, from this year, people turning 70 or 74 will also be invited to screen. Other age groups will be added progressively so that, by 2020, all Australians aged 50 to 74 will be able to be screened every two years. The program has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades, which I hope will continue.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is important for those aged over 50 to undergo regular screening for bowel cancer. It is also important that people are aware of the risk factors and symptoms. The member for Solomon pointed out that a young woman aged 21 had all the symptoms. You are at higher risk of bowel cancer if you are over 50, have a significant family history of bowel cancer or polyps, have an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or colitis and have previously had polyps in the bowel. The symptoms include bleeding from the rectum or any sign of blood in a bowel motion; a recent and persistent change in bowel habit; unexplained tiredness, which is a symptom of anaemia; and abdominal pain. Importantly, people can lower their risk of developing bowel cancer by having a healthy diet, by exercising regularly and by reducing alcohol consumption.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australia has one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world. I really wonder why that is the case. Is it our diet? Is it our lifestyle? Around one in 23 Australians will develop bowel cancer during their lifetime. It is the second most common type of newly diagnosed cancer in Australia and affects men and women equally. It is Australia's second biggest cancer killer, with more than 15,000 Australians diagnosed each year. These are scary statistics. I encourage all Australians to be aware of the risks and symptoms and to undergo regular screening tests if they are over 50. Walking past my chemist the other day, I saw a sign about regular testing and I thought: I've got to go and do that. So this weekend is the time.

                I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate, and I commend the member for Dobell for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. Bowel cancer is a disease that kills more people than prostate cancer and breast cancer. It affects women and men almost equally and is second only to lung cancer among cancer killers in Australia. Every week, 77 Australians lose their lives to bowel cancer. Many Australians would be surprised by these figures. In my experience, bowel cancer is a disease that is not as widely understood by Australians as some other cancers. So it is appropriate that
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
                 Bowel Cancer
                </a>
                Australia has designated June as Bowel Cancer Awareness Month for 2015.
               </p>
               <p>
                The facts are confronting. One in 12 people will develop bowel cancer in their lifetime and 15,000 people are diagnosed each year. And bowel cancer does not just strike the elderly; 1,000 of these diagnoses are for people under the age of 50. However, there is some good news. Ninety per cent of bowel cancer cases can be treated successfully if found early. But herein lies the problem: bowel cancer is detected early in fewer than 40 per cent of all cases. So the solution is clear: we need to do more to raise awareness and to educate Australians about the symptoms of bowel cancer. According to Bowel Cancer Australia, the symptoms can include blood in the bowel movement, unexplained weight loss, persistent change in bowel habit, and severe abdominal pain. Bowel Cancer Australia recommends that people suffering from any of these symptoms should see their general practitioner.
               </p>
               <p>
                This month is all about awareness. Thankfully, experts do understand many of the risk factors that can explain the onset of bowel cancer. They can, therefore, recommend a range of simple, common-sense lifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer by up to 75 per cent. For instance, there is evidence that higher levels of physical activity protect against colon cancer. Bowel Cancer Australia recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, if not all, days—and 60 minutes per day is preferable. Maintenance of a healthy body weight is also important.
               </p>
               <p>
                In terms of diet, there is evidence that consumption of garlic, milk and calcium—not all together!—probably also protects against bowel cancer, as does a focus on high fibre foods, including wholegrain cereals, nuts, seeds and beans. Further evidence, albeit weaker, also suggests a link between the consumption of non-starchy vegetables, fruits or foods containing vitamin D and a reduced incidence of bowel cancer. Bowel Cancer Australia recommends consumption of at least five servings of non-starchy fruits and vegetables every day.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is also recommended that alcoholic drinks should be limited to no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women, with two alcohol-free days a week. And, as is the case with many other cancers, smoking is a risk factor for developing bowel cancer. Studies have shown that the smoking of 40 cigarettes a day increases the risk of bowel cancer by 38 per cent.
               </p>
               <p>
                Risk factors that we cannot avoid include family history. In around 25 per cent of all bowel cancer cases, there is a family history or hereditary contribution. It is therefore important for people with a family history of bowel cancer to pay particular attention to the symptoms and to make the lifestyle decisions necessary to minimise risk.
               </p>
               <p>
                Age is also a risk factor. Bowel cancer risk increases with age, so for people over 50, Bowel Cancer Australia recommends undertaking a screening every one to two years. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program offers free screening for people aged 50, 55, 60 and 65.
               </p>
               <p>
                As part of Bowel Cancer Awareness Month, this Wednesday 17 June is Red Apple Day. On Wednesday, Australians are encouraged to wear a green and red bowel cancer awareness ribbon and host apple themed fundraisers. For those who want to get involved, information is available at http://www.bowelcancerawarenessmonth.org/. There are details on the website to assist individuals, workplaces, patients, healthcare professionals and schools to all get involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                Bowel cancer is a disease that can be prevented in many cases and, if detected early, can be treated effectively. But the first step is awareness, and I commend Bowel Cancer Australia for all the work they are doing to make Australians more aware of the symptoms, risk factors, screenings and treatments available for bowel cancer. I commend the motion to the House.

                <p>
                 Thank you to the member for Dobell for bringing this motion to the House. I certainly also endorse the amendments by the member for Shortland. It is nice to see bipartisanship on this issue, as I am sure we would expect. Of course in this area of health, as in so many areas, partisanship does not help you. We all suffer these things to one degree or another. Our communities and our families all suffer from these things, and bowel cancer is certainly a very serious condition and, obviously, a very serious cancer which affects communities right around Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is the second most common cancer diagnosed in Australia in 2010, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer—14,860 new cases. In 2011, there were also almost 4000 deaths. This is a very serious cancer. One in 12 Australians are likely to develop it at some time over their lifetime. Men are slightly more likely to be diagnosed than women, but it does affect both sexes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 While no cancer is preventable, it is estimated that changes to diet and physical activity can reduce the incidence, and we heard some excellent contributions from the member for Ryan. It seems like a good diet and avoiding alcohol—or at least accepting it in moderation—are good for our health in so many areas. We know that age, health history and certain genetic factors do place people at risk of having bowel cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Fifteen thousand Australians are detected with bowel cancer every year, including more than 1,000 who are under 50 at the time of detection. Twenty five per cent of all bowel cancers are shown to be linked to previous diagnoses in the family.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is recommended that everyone above the age of 50 be screened every year for bowel cancer. If it is detected early—and this is critical—then 90 per cent of bowel cancers can be treated. The great tragedy at the moment is that fewer than 40 per cent of cases are actually detected early enough. The difficulty, with this widespread cancer, is that we are not having screenings early enough even though they are widely available. People do need to look for the signs: blood in the bowel movement, unexplained weight loss, persistent change in bowel habits and severe abdominal pain. And of course there are associated risk factors—alcohol consumption, dietary factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, family history and genetic susceptibility. Those things combined, obviously people need to see their general practitioner. A relationship with a general practitioner is a very important step to good overall health, and I would certainly encourage people to have that relationship so that they can raise what are sometimes embarrassing, or seemingly embarrassing, health related things with their general practitioner, things that do need to be raised.
                </p>

                 Screening Program was initiated by the Australian government in 2006 in partnership with state and territory governments. It helps detect bowel cancers early and reduce the number of Australians who die every year from this disease. So by 2020, the aim is to get all Australians aged 50 to 74 to be invited to screen once every two years. Patients will receive a screening invitation and a free screening test kit and other program information through the post around the time of their birthday. So they are sent this free, home-based screening kit, and once the bowel samples are collected, patients can send them off to a pathology laboratory in a reply paid envelope. Participation is voluntary but it is certainly recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In my own home state, bowel cancer is the second most common cancer. It is something that certainly affects an ageing population, which

                  South Australia
                 </a>
                 has. I certainly commend those who brought the motion and amended the motion to the House. It is very important that we do pay attention to cancers which are prevalent, and that we take every action both through encouraging people in their own health and through their relationship with a general practitioner to get it early, and that way it can get fixed earlier.
