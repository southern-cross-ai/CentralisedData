        I would like to express my condolences at the recent death of Mrs Heather Southcott AM, who was a former member of the

        in the seat of Mitcham. Heather was my great aunt. I thank the South Australian members of parliament who have spoken on the condolence motion in the

       <p>
        Heather was born in 1928 and was the daughter of a bank manager and a community-minded homemaker and was raised in the tradition of the Scots Free Church. Her father encouraged her to believe that she could do anything. She studied pharmacy at the

        and was one of only four women in her year. She met her husband Ron Southcott, my great uncle, when they both worked at the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital and married in 1952. At that time, the marriage bar required Heather to leave her job as a Commonwealth public servant. She returned to private work in pharmacy while raising two daughters, Jane and Anne Marie.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to speak a little about Heather's family. They were and are a high-achieving family with an enormous range of interests and a strong ethos of service. I often met people who had worked with one of them and was always happy to reflect on what they had done. Being a relative, it was an association which I have always been proud of and I had a high regard for the work that Heather and the rest of her family had done. Ron was described by paediatrician and toxicologist, Dr John Pearn, as among the greatest of the Australian doctor-naturalists who worked as an administrator with the Commonwealth Department of

        Heather was the first woman to lead a political party in Australia being the state leader and later the national leader of the Australian Democrats. She only spent six months in the South Australian parliament. She enjoyed the electorate work but she did not enjoy being a sole Democrat in the parliament, but she was able later to use the work and the experience for a variety of community organisations. She was very active in the community. My condolences to her family.
