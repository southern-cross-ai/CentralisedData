        Yesterday, I went to the Maroota Muster, the annual fundraiser for Maroota Public School. The event has raised a lot of money for Maroota over the years. It's a small but excellent school in my electorate. The first muster was held in 2004, but the event traces its origins back to 1981. From a small art-and-craft fete, the event has since grown to become a celebration of the rural communities in my electorate. As always, this muster was a great day for families in the community. David Camilleriran the chocolate wheel. Activities and attractions included: vintage machines and classic cars; woodchopping and woodturning; stalls run by the local

        and Men's Sheds; carnival rides; show bags; face planting; plant, fruit and vegie stores; and the ever-popular cake stall.
       </p>

        I want to acknowledge Deidre Dorbis, the principal of Maroota Public School. Parents and children there know what a fantastic principal she is, dedicated to the children's education and wellbeing. It was great to see recently retired teacher Pat Chivers there, continuing to lend a hand to support the school. Let me commend the Maroota Public School P&amp;C, who worked to ensure that this muster was again tremendous. In particular, I thank their president,

        ; Lisa Aylward; Kirsty Higson; Olivia Graham; Lucinda Harrex; Sharyn Davies; and Val Harper. They all did a great job. It's because of their hard work that Maroota Public School has been able to fund the refurbishment of its school hall and implement programs like a swim school, athletics coaching and after-hours school care. I want to wish Maroota Public School every success and congratulations on another fantastic muster for 2018.
