        I would like to congratulate two vibrant country communities on their successful agricultural shows that I visited on Friday and Saturday last week. Gresford held its 84th annual agricultural show and Gloucester had their 102nd agricultural show. On exhibit at both places, the ring events dominated with some magnificently prepared and trained horses and very skilful riders. We also had cattle exhibits, both beef and dairy; goats; and poultry—all with years of selective breeding in animal husbandry and pasture improvement on show. We also had dogs on show—but not only that; we also had art and photography, tapestry and quilting. We had fruit and vegetable growers whose produce was on display in a competitive sense. We had vignerons and grape growers with their produce and fruit of the vine for us to sample and buy. The timber industry had all its historical and current skills on show with chainsaw competitions at Gresford and wood chopping at Gloucester. We had Rotary supplying the barbie and

        I would like to congratulate the Gresford committee: president Tim Capp, vice presidents Mick Kealy and

        These agricultural shows are not just a celebration of rural life. They are very important. They reflect the skills, development and years of growth in rural industries. It is a platform for training and skills development for the future, for the next generation of farmers who will continue to produce the wealth of our nation. They drive the local and regional economies and also feed our nation and many millions across the Asian region and around the world, because 60 per cent of our agricultural produce is not consumed in this country; it is grown for another 60 or 70 million people around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all concerned. It was a wonderful celebration of years of work, personal effort and industry and it is the backbone of the regional economies.
