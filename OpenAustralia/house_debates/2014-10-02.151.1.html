       <p>
        Without doubt, small business is the engine room of the economy. For regions like the Nepean Valley, where two-thirds of our local community need to commute every day for work, building our local small businesses and family businesses is crucial to the success of our region. I come from a small business background and have seen firsthand the difficulty, sacrifice and commitment it takes to have a successful small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night in the great region of Lindsay there was one of the most exciting events of the small business calendar: the local small business awards. It was great to see 30 small businesses that were recognised for their achievements, for their excellence, for their commitment and for what they provide our local community. I would like to take the opportunity today to congratulate and formally recognise in this place some of those amazing recipients who received awards last night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Business of the Year went to

        and his team at Workin' Gear Penrith. This is a business that has traded for over 24 years. I have had to buy the odd pair of hiking boots or what have you from this business. It also sells a whole range of high-vis wear and KingGee wear for people who are out working in the region. It has a whole host of other heavy duty supplies. It was wonderful that it won the Business of the Year award last night.
