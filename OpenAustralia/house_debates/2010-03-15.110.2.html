        I present the

         Airport Development Ombudsman Bill 2010
        </a>
        . This bill is to give people a right to be heard over their concerns about developments on airport land. It is well recognised that people have a right to be heard about developments that are undertaken in their neighbourhood so that they can be satisfied their concerns will be addressed. This usually occurs through state and local planning authorities. The existing systems may not be perfect, but they are usually robust.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be no different when it comes to Commonwealth land at airports. I want to make sure that residents have a clear process for complaints about developments at airports. This can be achieved by the establishment of an Airport Development Ombudsman, an independent authority with the power to investigate residents’ concerns fairly and impartially. I have previously advised the House about the widespread community anger in my seat of Hasluck when the construction of a brickworks was approved by the Howard government at Perth airport. The brickworks, which would have failed to pass state and local planning processes at other residential sites, encountered no such impediment at Perth airport. The building of the brickworks commenced in late 2006 and is now established with operations underway. Many of the concerns and fears expressed by residents about the development at the time have come to pass.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of particular concern to residents were the safety, health and environmental impacts of this development. A local residents’ action group protested at the proposed development along with relevant local councils, the state government, and the former federal Liberal member for Hasluck. They were joined and supported by many community organisations such as the Nature Reserves Preservation Group and the Alliance for a Clean Environment, but to no avail. The development was a bad outcome for my constituents. It has thrown up ongoing issues which need to be addressed.

        These include, the movement of heavy trucks on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamunda_Road" rel="nofollow">

        , a busy road servicing several nearby residential suburbs including

        , and Kalamunda. These truck movements have had a significant impact on the state of the road and the ability of residents to use the road safely, especially the senior residents of the local lifestyle village. Many residents complain about the state of the ambient air quality in suburbs around the brickworks. Brickworks do generate toxic air emissions. There is no regular communication about this issue or to address these concerns.

        Local environmental groups complain about inappropriate land clearing at the site and around the airport. Perth airport has areas of high conservation value, including wetlands and Bush Forever land. My community believe they have no viable avenue to raise their concerns and receive feedback on airport developments. I want to congratulate the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">

        , on the national aviation policy white paper. The white paper strikes a balance between airports as essential infrastructure being allowed to function without impediment and minimising the negative impact upon the environment and local communities. Aviation is an industry of national strategic importance to Australia and the white paper commits the government to work with state, territory and local governments to achieve a more balanced airports planning framework which will provide communities with more input into airport planning, including formalised community aviation consultation groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        The white paper also commits the government to introducing an aircraft noise ombudsman within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        to independently review noise complaints handling procedures and to improve Airservices’ consultation arrangements. This is a pleasing development as there has been significant community concern regarding an increase in aircraft noise following the Western Australian Route Review Project in late 2008 that changed local aircraft routes. These measures, especially the establishment of an aircraft noise ombudsman, are commendable improvements and will go a long way to better integrating airports with the communities in which they are located. Unfortunately the proposed consultation mechanisms for airport development do not go far enough to repair the loss of face experienced by my community of Hasluck. Public confidence was severely undermined by the decision of the Howard government to approve the brickworks. The residents of Hasluck and residents near all airport land require the knowledge that there is an independent authority that will receive their complaints and deal with them fairly and impartially. We need an airport development ombudsman who can hold developers and airport operators to account for the impact that they have on neighbouring communities. I promised the electorate of Hasluck in the 2007 election that I would bring this matter to the parliament and I urge the parliament to support this bill.
