        One thing you can trust the Turnbull government on is to deliver for local communities. Gippsland's regional arts network has received a significant boost with confirmation the coalition government—the Turnbull government—will fund the West Gippsland Arts Centre redevelopment. The federal government will contribute $4 million to the $13.9 million West Gippsland Arts Centre project, which Baw Baw Shire Council expects will create 220 direct and indirect jobs during construction. The project will increase seating capacity in the main theatre from 460 to 760 seats, and includes upgrades to technical, performer, visitor and administration facilities. The arts centre will complement works already undertaken and underway at the new Latrobe Creative Precinct in Traralgon, the revamped Latrobe Regional Gallery in Morwell and the new Port of Sale Cultural Hub.

        I pay tribute to my colleague

        , who knows how the arts community works across Gippsland. This redevelopment means that visiting acts can come in and use four strategic spots where they can entertain. It is a really good outcome for a community, because Gippsland—unlike Bendigo and Ballarat—is a broad spread of communities. To be able to combine them in the way that has been done really shows that the thinking that has gone into this is very important.

        We are only putting $4 million into this and the community is putting in the rest, but I not only pay tribute to my colleague Darren Chester and the important strategic role he has played in delivering on behalf of the community but also want to thank

        and Leane Gooding. They are just two local people who really wanted this upgrade of the arts centre. They came to see me in genuine need and outlined why they needed this $4 million to complete the funding: to get this over the line and to make it happen. It is great when community people like John and Leane actually take the initiative, come to see their local member, explain their situation, and go through it in a way that supports the arts community. The arts community is not a hidden community—it is out there and it is strong and relevant—but it is great when people like Leane Gooding and John Parker come in and, with no pretence whatsoever, just lay it out and say: 'This is why we need the $4 million. How can you deliver it, Russell?' Well, with the help of Darren Chester, we have been able to deliver this for the community. It will be really good.

        in our own local community—I know how much benefit the people will get out of this minor funding. It is minor funding, but it is not minor for the community.
