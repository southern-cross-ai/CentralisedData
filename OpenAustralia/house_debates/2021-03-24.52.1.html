         I thank the member for Mallee for her question and acknowledge that we've had substantial and severe rain in parts of Victoria and indeed many, many parts of eastern Australia, across the country. It's been tragic to see some of the consequences of that rainfall. It wasn't that long ago that we were in the country's most substantial dry spell for a long, long time, and now we have flooding rains. And while it's positive to see clear skies over some parts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         today, the risk of existing and increasing floodwaters persists, and those rising waters unfortunately have not yet peaked.
        </p>
        <p>
         This reprieve from rain does not mitigate the risk which has been building over the past week. This being the case, I would again remind people, as the Prime Minister has consistently done, not to drive into those flooded roadways, not to go surfing and to follow the directions of local emergency personnel. I've heard Minister Littleproud say it—and it is just common sense—but we need to reiterate that you are not only placing your own life at risk when you do that; you're placing at risk the lives of those who may have to come to rescue you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Road closures are occurring across New South Wales. I would encourage people to check with local councils if they're going on a major trip, or even in a local situation. Significant areas of Australia remain flooded and 40,000 evacuation orders are in place. It's too early to know what damage has been done, but an assessment will take place. When those floodwaters recede, we will make sure that we will build back better.
        </p>

         One thing we can agree on is that our truckies have been magnificent. I thank them for restocking the supermarket shelves and for continuing the delivery of the vaccine rollout. I spoke to Saul Resnick, of

         , yesterday. I appreciate that Linfox too are playing their part. DHL has delivered nearly 600,000 doses of Pfizer and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">

         vaccines around Australia and travelled nearly three million kilometres in doing so. Our truckies have been magnificent. They will continue to step up and answer the challenge that has been placed on them during COVID and in this flood situation. They'll keep those wheels of transport rolling. I thank them again.
