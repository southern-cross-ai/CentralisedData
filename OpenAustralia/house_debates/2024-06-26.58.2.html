        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister spent the first 18 months distracted by touring the world and spending $450 million on the divisive Voice referendum instead of focusing on making economic decisions and putting budgets together to help Australian families—not hurt them. Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for the cost-of-living pain that Australian families are feeling today?

          I'll leave people to draw their own conclusions between the gap that was there of mere seconds of speaking about the importance of a relationship with our neighbours and with the world and that question. He asked me about what we are doing. What we're doing is dealing with cost-of-living pressures, cost-of-living pressures that he has voted against—every single one of them!
         </p>
         <p>
          Energy price relief: what did he do? He voted against it. The tax cuts for every Australian that will come in on Monday for all 13.6 million taxpayers, he not only said that they should be rolled back—and the opposition said they would reverse it—he said we should go to an election on it. That was how strongly he felt about it before he voted for it.
         </p>
         <p>
          He voted against cheaper medicines. You know, 60-day dispensing was going to have a devastating impact. Pharmacies were going to close. None of that happened either. He is against fee-free
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
           TAFE
          </a>
          . Now over 400,000 Australians have already enrolled in fee-free TAFE and made a difference there. Of course, we know that he has opposed wages keeping up with the cost of living. What they did—
