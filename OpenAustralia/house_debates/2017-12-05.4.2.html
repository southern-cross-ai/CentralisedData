         Because of the number of speeches we have on this issue I won't speak for long. I simply say that the opposition support the resolution. We remain willing for whatever additional hours are required to make sure that we can get through the debate on this bill in a reasonable time. I'm very conscious that, if—

           I think there was limited discretion that was available to the Speaker on that particular issue. I say, though, that, with the number of speakers who are on the list, I do believe we will need to do more than what is in this current resolution. I indicate to the government that the opposition is willing to work with any further additional hours. Anything that has an agreement that all speeches go for 10 minutes rather than 15—as long as it's all at 15, our members will use the time as well, but, if there's agreement to go to 10, we're very happy to facilitate that. I am concerned that, if we let the debate go too long, we'll end up with other members who want to move amendments feeling frustrated with the time available. There is goodwill across the chamber, and we want to make sure, particularly on a conscience vote issue, that no debate is gagged and everyone get the opportunity to make their speeches. In saying that, we support the resolution.

            On the debate itself, if I could just make a couple of remarks, as seems timely now: obviously, on a question like this there are strong views, and the House recognises that, despite anyone's views, it's a historic proposition before the House. We've seen members wearing badges, which I think is on the right side of the line. I notice the member for Leichhardt's got a tie, which he wore yesterday, which is completely within the standing orders. That's fine. I just want to say to members my preference is that we don't keep extending props on the subject. We do have rules on props, and they're well known. I do need to point that out. At the conclusion of a long debate, it is reasonable that more tolerance will be shown by the chair. I just want to make that point. It's probably easier if I make the point that way. To date, it's been perfectly proper. I commend the member for Leichhardt and those who have spoken so far. We like to be able to compare ourselves with the other place favourably.
