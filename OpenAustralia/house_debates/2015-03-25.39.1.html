        Earlier this month I joined over half a million Australians and rolled up my sleeves and took part in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I love getting involved in the Clean Up Australia Day initiative, and this year I joined
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_College" rel="nofollow">
         Immanuel College
        </a>
        students to help pick up roadside rubbish at

        Skate Park and along

         Tapleys Hill Road
        </a>
        . It was great to see school students out there taking pride in their surroundings. I then joined members of the Grange Baptist Church cleaning up Kirkcaldy Park. I had a great time with the parents and children in Grange. We even pulled an old bike out of the creek.

       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organisers of both sites, Jude Thorpe and Jill Hinton, and the large number of volunteers who took part for their commitment and enthusiasm. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts at West Beach of the

        </a>
        , which the member for Chifley,

        What Clean Up Australia Day really highlights is the need for each of us to look after our environment. This year Clean Up Australia Day celebrated its 25th anniversary. In that time volunteers have removed over 300,000 tonnes of rubbish from our parks, beaches, roads and green spacesâ€”a terrific achievement. On a larger scale, the federal government is improving the environment through the National Landcare Program and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">

        initiative. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        this includes $l million of funding to improve the health of the
