        In moving these amendments, the Australian government is responding to a recom­mendation of the House

         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. The committee has recommended replacing the functions of the designated authority in the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 with the responsible state minister. This amendment was sought by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        government to continue its role in the administration of offshore petroleum royalties from the

         North West Shelf
        </a>
        project area. I note that offshore petroleum royalties only apply to the North West Shelf project area off Western Australia. In accordance with revenue sharing arrangements in the offshore legis­lation, the Western Australian government receives approximately two-thirds of the revenue collected. The government amend­ments propose to continue the Western Australian government's direct role in the administration of offshore petroleum royal­ties from Commonwealth waters. These waters currently raise significant revenue, estimated to be around $900 million for Western Australia and $450 million for the Commonwealth in 2010-11. The government amendments will enable the continued use of specialist royalty expertise in the Western Australian department. This amendment does not adversely impact on the integrity of the other reforms and the package of bills to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator. I commend the amendments to the House.

         This bill excludes application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994. Under registration requirements in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the regulator has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a petroleum title, and the responsible Commonwealth minister has the ability to refuse to approve a dealing in relation to a greenhouse gas title. This ability to refuse approval and registration of an interest underpins the purpose of the regist­ration requirement, to enable the Australian government to ensure the suitability of the entities that potentially are able to exercise control over the exploitation of Australia’s offshore petroleum resources. Further to this, state and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         governments have advised the Commonwealth that they are electing to opt out of or exclude the operation of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 for their onshore mining schemes. Therefore, excluding application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 is important to ensure national consistency for the mining industry by minimising the regulatory burden and costs to the industry and its investors in complying with different registration requirements, to prevent skewing investment. I commend the bill to the House.

         <p>
          This is the fifth and final bill of a complex legislative instrument. Australian taxpayers should not have to bear the cost of regulating the offshore oil and gas activities. This bill will enable the recovery of the cost of regulation from industry, while minimising the regulatory burden on the industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to allow two types of cost recovery levies: an annual titles administ­ration levy for an eligible title in force, for each year of the term of the title, to recover the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA) costs; and an environment plan levy to recover the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) costs.
         </p>
         <p>
          In line with the Australian government's policy, NOPSEMA and NOPTA are to be funded on a full cost recovery basis with levies raised from the offshore petroleum industry. These fees will be reviewed regularly to ensure the fees reflect the cost of regulating the petroleum industry. The initial fees to recover the establishment and expansion costs for NOPTA and NOPSEMA have already undergone a cost recovery impact statement process. A further cost recovery impact statement will be undert­aken in the second half of 2011 covering NOPTA's and NOPSEMA's operating costs after 1 January 2012. These new levies will, on balance, be less than the fees levied under the current designated authority system and will reflect the true cost of offshore regulation. These reforms reduce the unnecessary compliance burden on industry of compliance and ensure the development of our offshore resources for the benefit of all Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also say, in seeking to bring this debate to conclusion, I appreciate the contribution to this debate by a range of members in the House and, importantly, the constructive engagement I have had with the opposition over an extended period in seeking to get to this point. The petroleum industry is very important to Australia's economic future. Gas is also regarded as a clean fuel in a transition to a lower emission economy; hence, the constructive development of this industry is essential to Australia's economic and environmental future. We therefore must work collectively together to maintain our social licence to operate in this industry. The experiences of the last 18 months to two years, both in the US with Macondo in the Gulf and in Australia with Montara, have sent a serious message to each and every one of us that we have to work to improve our performance when it comes to best practice in terms of the regulatory regime applicable in this industry. It is the intent of all members of the House to achieve that objective, and I am very lucky to have the support of the House with respect to that very objective.
         </p>
         <p>
          As is always the case with respect to the reports that I have had to consider and the preparation of the legislative instruments, I, and previously the member for Groom, as minister, rely on a very good Public Service team to do all the necessary hard work. I say to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, particularly the team responsible which is with us in the House today, thank you for a job well done. It is a huge effort, and the Australian community will be the beneficiary of your detailed commitment to consultation in the preparation of the bills which will soon come to conclusion in consideration of the House. I also say that I will continue to work with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          n government to try and reach a conclusion on what I think is an objective being pursued both by Minister Moore, in Western Australia, and me, in the Common­wealth, with the support of the member for Groom, the shadow minister, to ensure not only that, at the end of this debate, there is agreement but that we are all satisfied we have best practice when it comes to the regulation of the petroleum industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

          <p>
           by leave—I rise briefly to associate myself with the comments that the Minister for Resources and Energy has just made and to reinforce a few of those comments. Firstly, as to the terms of the social licence of the oil and gas industry to operate in Australia, that is a key issue in terms of this industry going forward. As the minister said, it has a critical, if not crucial, role to play in a low-emissions economy, but it has to do that within the community expectations and the environmental constraints that are placed on the industry and it has to do it in such a way that the industry has the absolute confidence of the community.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly, I would like to join the minister in thanking the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism for their role in this legislation. As the minister suggested, it is very complex legislation and there is a set of quite complex amendments to go with it. It has been crucially important, as has been emphasised by those on both sides of the House, that we get this legislation right. It underpins the legislative framework which will ensure the safety of not only those who work in this industry but also, and just as importantly, the environment which hosts this industry. I thank the department, which is, from my personal experience as a minister, the best department in Australia, and I say that without reservation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, I thank the minister for the time that he has spent in negotiating with Minister Moore in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           and I thank him for his commitment going forward that those negotiations will continue with the goal of reaching a conclusion. It is important that all parties in this debate do each have the opportunity to express their views. It has been very much a hallmark, starting with the inquiry after the Montara disaster, that all stakeholders in this debate have been able to participate, so I welcome the commitment of the minister going forward.

              <p>
               I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. Whilst this is a relatively dry bill—just updating some definitions within the framework of the free trade agreement that we have with our very good partner New Zealand—I think it is a reasonable time for us to think about the success of that free trade agreement. It was Australia's first free trade agreement. It was negotiated in the early 1980s and implemented in 1983, at a time when free trade was probably less fashionable than it is now. You will obviously still hear arguments for and against free trade now and those arguments have been ongoing literally for centuries within the political sphere. But this agreement has done a lot to advance the economic interests of Australia and the economic interests of our partner New Zealand. Although this is a relatively dry bill, it is important for us as a parliament to reflect on the success of that free trade agreement and about how it was a precursor for future free trade agreements that we negotiated with other partners.
              </p>
              <p>
               I always like to refer back to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith" rel="nofollow">
                Adam Smith
               </a>
               when we look at economic issues. Although he wrote many centuries ago, his insights into the way an economy works are still relevant today. On trade, he said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. ... If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.
              </p>
              <p>
               Essentially he was talking about the economic law of comparative advantage—though he would not have called it this at the time—which was developed slightly later by another British economist. But the words that Adam Smith wrote in his classic book
               <i>
                The Wealth of Nations
               </i>
               are still very relevant to us today, and a great reminder about how important free trade is and about how politicians constantly get people arguing with us about why free trade is not that important. The way those arguments are put to us varies greatly. In the old days, there were mercantile arguments between free traders and protectionists, about why it was in the national interest not to trade freely with other countries. Now these arguments come to us in different ways. They come to us in possibly more sophisticated ways. They come to us in ways in relation to industry policy or in the guise of fair trade, which is a term which I do not think is necessarily very well understood.

               I see the member for Brand at the table. I am sure his father-in-law would have agreed with what I am saying. If the Labor Party still had men of that calibre, I suspect they would not be having the political problems they are having today.

                 This bill really just updates some definitions and some other nomenclature issues within the closer economic relation­ship framework that we have with our brothers in New Zealand. Whilst this bill is rather technical in nature, it is timely that the parliament discusses it in the wake of the visit and the historic address to this parliament by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rt_Hon" rel="nofollow">

                 largest export market. Prime Minister Key made that point when he addressed the parliament. More than half of direct foreign investment in New Zealand, around $50 billion, comes from Australia. Last year, Australian exports to New Zealand totalled just over $8 billion, which is actually not far from the $9 billion that we exported to the United States. That gives you some idea about the vital importance of the economic relationship that we share with New Zealand.

                 contributing 70. Our two countries' forces are complementary in equipment and in culture. We work well together in East Timor and also in other battlefields and other conflicts around the world. We have a tremendous history together. The bond between our defence forces remains incredibly strong with a high degree of common purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This common purpose also forms the cornerstone of our trade and economic relationships in the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agree­ment, which came into effect on 1 January 1983 and is, as I have mentioned, one of Australia's most important economic treaties. The agreement is comprehensive and wide ranging and provides New Zealand and Australia with liberal access to each others goods, services and investment markets. As noted on the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
                  DFAT
                 </a>
                 website, the objectives of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement are to strengthen the broad relationship between Australia and New Zealand, to develop closer economic relations between member states through a mutually beneficial expansion of free trade between New Zealand and Australia, to eliminate barriers to trade between Australia and New Zealand in a gradual and progres­sive manner under an agreed timetable and within minimum disruption, and to develop trade between Australia and New Zealand under conditions of fair competition. The agreement reaffirms the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand. On 1 January 2007 the agreement rules of origin provision underwent significant change to allow both the change in tariff classification method and the regional value content method to be used to establish whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement both parties also agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. This review, which was commenced in late 2008 and completed in March of last year, resulted in amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and related product specific rules in annex G to the agreement. The modifications to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. That obviously came to pass as this agreement is approaching its 30th anniversary and over time the definitions that are used within international free trade agreements change, and this bill reflects those more modern terminologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to implement amend­ments to the rules of origin requirements under the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_New_Zealand_Closer_Economic_Relations_Trade_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
                  Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement
                 </a>
                 and amend definitions within the act. These requirements are outlined in article 3 and annex G of the agreement. The amendments to the Customs Act implements the amendments to article 3 of the agreement. Amendments to the Customs (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Regulations 2006 will implement the amendment at annex G of the agreement. As has been noted in this bill's explanatory memorandum, the bill will amend division 1E of part
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIII" rel="nofollow">
                  VIII
                 </a>
                 of the Customs Act to insert a new definition of 'aquaculture', to amend the definition of 'manufacture', to amend the definition of 'produce', to amend the provisions dealing with wholly obtained goods, to amend the provisions dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture, to insert a new section to provide that goods are not New Zealand originating goods merely because of the certain operations, and make consequential amendments to the verification powers in division 4D of part VI of the Customs Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The practical effects of this bill are relatively limited; it is not just a definitional bill. It is, as I said at the outset, a timely reminder to this parliament about the importance of the trade agreement we have with New Zealand. This is a pretty unique agreement in the world. It is underpinned by free movement of people between two countries. There are very few pairs of nations around the world that have such a close economic relationship as Australia and New Zealand. In fact, there are very few nations around the world that have such close political and defence ties. Indeed, New Zealand is actually mentioned as one of the possible constituent parts of the Common­wealth of Australia in our Constitution; my home state of

                 is not. This just shows you the way that history has developed between our two countries and about how important it is to both countries.

                  <p>
                   It is with great pleasure that I rise just weeks after this parliament was addressed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Prime Minister Key, to speak in favour of the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The ties that bind
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                    Australia and New Zealand
                   </a>
                   go back to the very origins of our two great nations. We are the closest neighbours and the very best of friends and allies, apart from on the rugby field. We share the Anzac heritage and conflicts both in our mutual past and through to today with our mutual commitment to eliminating terrorism in Afghanistan and bringing stability to that nation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However, our ties go beyond conflict. We share a mutual culture and many Australians have fallen so in love with New Zealand that they have made it their permanent home or at least a regular tourist destination. Who has not heard it said that there are more
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealander" rel="nofollow">
                    New Zealander
                   </a>
                   s living in Bondi than in Auckland? Even Prime Minister Key, who was here a few weeks ago, himself admitted that he has also lived in Australia. I think he was down in Bondi but he was in Sydney.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   My sister is married to a New Zealander. They have a debate going on amongst themselves. They have two children born in Chile. I think the eldest girl is going to be an Australian and the younger boy is going to be a New Zealander, so they will have these different nationalities, which is very interesting. The ties are very thick and close.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is because of this closeness that we have all been so deeply affected by the earthquakes in Christchurch where there is a need to demolish some 10,000 houses, where the elderly have been moved to other parts of the country and where schools are doubling up on students just to make sure that their education continues. We have heard that Christchurch's CBD has been shattered and may never recover and that so much has been destroyed and there is so much uncertainty that they are not sure whether to rebuild. I know that the spirit is very strong there and that they are keen to rebuild, but they have a big job ahead of them. I know that all the Australians are out gunning for them to succeed in that mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have heard that 181 people have lost their lives and that the cost to the New Zealand economy will be huge. It is estimated that there will be a loss to the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                    GDP
                   </a>
                   of some $15 billion. This is a hit to their economy of such epic proportions it will take time to recover. This recovery will very much involve Australia. We have already provided rescue and emergency teams, but we will also provide our assistance in economic terms as well. To this end I was very interested to hear Prime Minister Key talk about exactly how much economic investment flows between Australia and New Zealand. We would all be aware that he said some $50 billion of investment in New Zealand is from Australia. I was also interested to hear that exports to New Zealand total some $8 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Given our focus on China and Asia generally and the large investments made there, we at times can tend to forget the importance of New Zealand for the prosperity of our export trade. While the New Zealand trade may be small, the proximity of New Zealand, our shared culture and our trade agreements make it in many ways a more enticing offering for many businesses. Perhaps it is for this reason that Prime Minister Key noted that so many small and medium Australian businesses cut their teeth in the international market by first exporting and investing in New Zealand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This bill has been made possible by the close trade relationships that have developed between New Zealand and Australia over time. A cornerstone of this closeness in recent history could be said to be the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, signed in 1983, and known widely as the CER, a free trade agreement that is widely acknowledged as a model of the standards to which such agreements should aspire but which many, if not most, fail to achieve. This agreement is Australia's longest standing bilateral free trade agreement. It provides both Australia and New Zealand with liberal access to goods, services and investment markets. Many Australian jobs and busin­esses are underpinned by this agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The legislation before us today seeks to amend the provision of this agreement and its subsequent act to alter the rules of origin provisions. Rules of origin are those provisions—be they legislative, regulatory, administrative rulings—that are used to determine the country of origin of a good or service or investment. They are of import­ance in world trade, especially in a world that is characterised by the ever-growing globalisation of production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   These matters may appear technical or details of little interest, but the functioning of a bilateral trade agreement depends crucially on getting these details right. It is another reminder of the more workaday details that lie behind the big picture items that grab the headlines. It reminds us that the hard work of reform takes place on many levels and involves unglamorous hard work and careful attention to detail, very often performed by public servants in my own electorate who I know are here today to see their bill hopefully come to fruition. I am sure plenty of hours and midnight oil has been spent on this. I congratulate them on their work. There have been lots of public servants involved and lots of people committed to making a difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The current rules of origin for the free trade agreement entered into force on 1 January 2007. When negotiating these rules it was agreed by both Australia and New Zealand that there would be a review conducted after three years of the rules taking effect. This review began in 2008 by both Australian and New Zealand officials and was completed early last year. The review resulted in agreement to make amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G that deal with the definitions of particular industries and processes. These are the changes we make today. Specifically this bill inserts new definitions for aquaculture and amends the definitions for manufacture and produce. It also amends the provision dealing with wholly obtained goods and the provision dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture. In addition, it inserts a new section to provide that goods are not treated as having originated in New Zealand merely because of certain operations being performed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The government consulted Australian industry throughout the process of review. In addition, the Joint
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                    Standing Committee
                   </a>
                   on Treaties conducted three public hearings on the treaty changes before recommending that Australia take binding treaty action. The changes to the trade agreement will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia, which is very important. The amendments to article 3 will enter into force on the date when the Australian and New Zealand governments notify each other by an exchange of diplomatic notes that they have completed their respective domestic processes to bring the amendments into force.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The CER agreement is the standard by which bilateral free trade agreements are judged. For almost 30 years, it has played a significant part in the prosperity of Australia's export trade and our economy. The provisions before us today are good for the Australian economy, are good for the New Zealand economy and are an important part of the ongoing achievements of the government in support of the economic wellbeing of all Australians. These provisions are also good for the economic wellbeing of
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   , the economic wellbeing of people who need employment and Australian exports. I therefore commend this bill to the House.

                    I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901, a very, very old act. It is more than 100 years old. This act has been part of the laws of this nation since Federation, so today we are amending one of the original acts of parliament. The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to implement amendments to the rules of origin requirements under the

                    , which is a very important trade agreement between our two nations. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement came into effect on 1 January 1983 and it is fundamental to the Australia-New Zealand trade and economic relationship.

                    is a comprehensive and wide-ranging agreement that provides New Zealand and Australia with liberal access to each other's goods, services and investments markets.

                    The agreement reaffirms the close relationship between

                    . On 1 January 2007 the agreement's rules of origin provision underwent considerable change to permit both the change in tariff classification method and the regional value content method to be used to establish whether goods are of New Zealand origin. As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement, both parties also agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. This review, which commenced in late 2008 and was completed in March 2010, resulted in amendments to the text of article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G to the agreement. The modification to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist in the eligibility of duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia.

                    Although the coalition does not consider this bill to be controversial, it still has significant effects on many agricultural industries within the electorate of Maranoa. I particularly want to make sure that we capitalise on our competitive edge as a nation. They may be our cousins across the Tasman, but charity begins at home. Wool production, for instance, is the second most common enterprise on Australian farms. In the eastern states most wool is grown west of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range" rel="nofollow">
                     Great Dividing Range
                    </a>
                    and the total wool produced in Australia amounts to some 370,610 tonnes, with Queensland contribut­ing over 10,000 tonnes of wool annually. Australia is the world's dominant producer and exporter of wool, accounting for some 67 per cent of the world's wool exports from major producing countries.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Australian wool growers have recently enjoyed an increase in demand and also, related to that, an increase in price for their product, which I can assure you is long overdue. That is due to a lower supply and much higher demand coming out of China. The late autumn wool market defied the trend of cautious international buying by jumping some 56 per cent over the past year at a time when the Australian dollar surged 20 per cent. So it is even more remarkable that we have seen this price increase and increased interest from the international sector sustained against the backdrop of a higher Australian dollar.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I want to touch on the wool industry because Australia and New Zealand are significant producers of wool and there have been some tariff issues in the past. I think we have disadvantaged ourselves a little bit to the advantage of New Zealand when it came to some of the made-up products, particularly suit products, and have given New Zealand an edge over Australia when it came to using Australian made fabrics to produce suiting and other apparel. The wool industry is important to both our nations. In the international arena, we have worked cooperatively in the past but now, through Australian Wool Innovation, we are again seeing a cooperation which had perhaps been lost for many years. And it is important we include New Zealand as part of that cooperation.

                    </a>
                    launched an initiative aimed at increasing demand for British wool and wool from the Commonwealth, obviously including New Zealand. The wool project will see diverse groups from across the wool sector, including textile designers and the carpet and fashion industries, work together to improve public awareness of the benefits of this very sustainable product. Prince Charles has long been concerned about the low prices farmers have been receiving for their wool, so last year his Royal Highness brought the wool industry together, including New Zealand producers, fabric makers, carpet industries and textile designers, to see how they could work together globally to put wool onto a more sustainable economic footing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I was very pleased to see the Governor-General involved in this wool initiative, which includes not only Australian wool but New Zealand wool, through the Australian Wool Innovation launch at
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_House" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    in Sydney earlier this year. This initiative will see a world wool day later this year—in the first week of October, I think. I hope that this parliament takes up that opportunity—although we are sitting not that week but the following one—to participate in world wool day because wool is one of the great products of the world. It is sustainable and it is also a product that was very much instrumental in the early development and economic growth of this wonderful nation, Australia.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So I am looking forward to seeing how these amendments enable us to work with the New Zealand wool industry. I am of course interested in cooperation with many other New Zealand industries, but I am particularly interested to see how this will play out with our cousins in the wool industry, whether in textiles, apparel, nonapparel or design. I will be interested to see how we can—not only here in the Australian and New Zealand wool industry, from the producing and processing sectors right through, but also globally—push our advantages and the uniqueness of our wool fibres into other markets. I wanted to link the issue of wool into this bill because I think it is important that we work together in this industry. In the past, we worked together through what was called the International Wool Secretariat, but now we have Prince Charles's wool initiative pushing wool, through the Commonwealth countries, around the world. I think his initiative has certainly given things a great impetus.

                    </a>
                    , London and Europe, I saw the effect of this wool initiative. I saw how wool is being increas­ingly seen by consumers as a sustainable product. I think the initiative is going to continue to help our wool producers—as well as New Zealand wool producers—and that part of the wool industry which is beyond the farm gate. It will help us to promote wool from Australia and New Zealand and to promote our competitive advantages, particularly in processing. It will help us to promote that we are able to produce not just the raw product but the manufactured product and to export these products into other countries.

                    As I foreshadowed, I turn now to quarantine. It is important that we have this free trade between our two countries, but quarantine becomes a significant issue. The issue I refer to here is the proposal to import apples from New Zealand into Australia, although I know that a final decision is not due until next month. The only apple industry in Queensland is in my electorate of Maranoa, down on the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite_Belt" rel="nofollow">
                     Granite Belt
                    </a>
                    in Stanthorpe. If the decision under this agreement is to allow New Zealand apples into Australia, it will be the first time in 90 years we have seen apples imported from New Zealand into Australia. The restriction which has always kept New Zealand apples out of Australia has been a quarantine restriction. That is because New Zealand has a disease in apples called fire blight while Australia does not. If, through a breakdown in quarantine, we saw apples with fire blight brought into Australia and then saw fire blight accidentally ending up in our apple and pear orchards, we would decimate our industry. There are only two ways you can control a fire blight outbreak. One way is with very heavy herbicide use. The only other way is to destroy the tree totally—in other words, cut it down.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I know that the apple growers of my electorate, and pear growers across Australia, are very concerned about the protocol under this quarantine agreement. Unless something changes and New Zealand apples are not allowed to come in as a result of the decision to be made in August, the protocol means that New Zealand apple orchardists will themselves be clearing their apples for export into our markets here in Australia. The apple growers in my electorate of Maranoa, in the Granite Belt, and pear growers across Australia are very concerned at the protocol that is in place. We believe that this is terribly important, notwith­standing this free trade agreement, and that the risk remains too great. To orchardists in the apple and pear history, fire blight would be what foot-and-mouth disease is to the beef industry. We should take it just as seriously as we take foot-in-mouth, because one of the great advantages we have, and one of the great pleasures we enjoy in this country, is the fact we have clean, green food. It is one of the things we seem to take for granted. I think consumers across Australia are so lucky to have this clean, green, high-quality food at an affordable price. If we were to find under this free trade agreement that New Zealand apples were allowed into Australia and there was an accidental—and it would be accidental—outbreak of fire blight in our apple and pear industry, it would be directly related to the protocols, which I believe are too lax and run an unnecessary risk. I say to the Prime Minister and to the government: think again about allowing apples from New Zealand into Australia. The risk is too great. Fire blight would decimate our industry and the many family farmers who produce these wonderful products for us.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I say, 'Let's make sure we keep New Zealand apples with fire blight away.' Other than that, I support this bill. But, in the next month or so, we have to make sure that we continue our campaign to ensure that the government has listened to the industry and that it understands the risk of accidental entry, under quarantine rules as they are proposed, of apples from New Zealand into Australia. This could lead, as I said, to the decimation of our industry. Once again: an apple a day will keep the doctor away. Let us make sure that we keep New Zealand apples away while ever there is a threat of fire blight being brought into Australia.

                     I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. This bill contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to implement changes to article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agree­ment.

                     </a>
                     is the rules of origin, often referred to by its acronym ROO. In negotiating the current rules of origin, which came into force on 1 January 2007, it was agreed that a review should take place within three years of the rules taking effect. Australian and New Zealand officials commenced the review in late 2008 and completed it in March 2010. The amend­ments in the bill address some imperfections identified in that review. The amendments will result in a range of practical changes. For example, the changes made to ANZCERTA will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. It is expected that these benefits would be passed onto consumers. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the ANZCERTA and the free trade agreements that Australia has with other countries.

                    <p>
                     The ANZCERTA amendments were tabled in parliament in June last year, and I understand that the Joint

On 11 May 2011, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that Australia take binding treaty action. The government also consulted widely with the Australian indus­try throughout the process. Specifically, the bill will amend division 1E of part
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIII" rel="nofollow">

                    <p>
                     These amendments make sensible changes to definitions under the Customs Act, and I support them. They also highlight issues of concern that have arisen in recent years as a result of trade agreements between Australia and other countries, particularly with New Zealand. There is growing concern amongst Australian primary producers that Australian primary production is being increasingly placed at risk because of imported products which can either originate in a country of concern or come into Australia via a country like New Zealand, which Australia would generally feel secure in trading with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A current example is the concern of Australian potato growers that the import­ation of New Zealand potatoes could place at risk the Australian potato-growing industry because of the zebra chip disease that has been detected in New Zealand grown potatoes. The zebra chip disease was first detected in
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" rel="nofollow">
                      Central America
                     </a>
                     in the 1990s. It then made its way to New Zealand, where it was first detected in 2008. If the Australian potato industry were infected with the zebra chip disease, the livelihoods of over 2,000 Australian potato-growing families would be placed at risk because there is currently no known effective control procedure for this disease. I have to date presented petitions to this House signed by around 648 growers who are concerned about this matter. Their concern relates to the fact that they understand that there is a push to have potatoes imported from New Zealand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The member for Maranoa touched on another matter that I also wish to speak on, and that is the issue of apple growers in this country and their concerns about the importation of apples from New Zealand. In particular, they are concerned that the disease fire blight has been detected in New Zealand apples and, not surprisingly, they do not want to risk that disease being brought into Australia. Australia lost its appeal to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
                      World Trade Organisation
                     </a>
                     on this matter. I must say that I commend the minister for having appealed it in the first place. But, unfortunately, we lost the appeal. I underst­and that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, has now ordered that an import risk analysis be carried out prior to any approval of apple imports into Australia from New Zealand.

                     </a>
                     we also have an important apple industry—particularly in the

                     </a>
                     , which adjoins my electorate of Makin. I know that the apple growers there are concerned about the importation of New Zealand apples into this country. I have spoken with them on several occasions and in fact was able to organise a meeting between them and the previous agriculture minister,
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
                      Tony Burke
                     </a>
                     , to discuss their concerns. They have argued quite strongly that if we are going to allow in apples from New Zealand then at the very least we need to ensure we have the necessary safeguards in place and that those safeguards are well policed. They too are very concerned about the disease fire blight coming into this country, and I understand that one of the very reasons Australia is able to export much of its fruit and vegetable produce is that it is seen as a country that is relatively free of many of the diseases that other countries unfortunately have. If we were to in any way infect our own products, that would no longer be the case and I have no doubt that it would affect the export of Australian produce to overseas countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In that respect, I understand that over the past year Australia has imported vegetables worth $555 million which is in fact $306 million more than the export value of Australian vegetables over the same period. So we have already reached a situation where we are importing more vegetables than we are exporting. Australian growers, faced with the increased value of the Australian dollar and generally higher production overheads, are already at a disadvantage when competing with overseas growers. The one advantage that they have, and which they value, is the quality of the produce grown here. Jeopardising that quality by importing products from countries where disease has been detected is a risk that they simply do not need. Even with Aust­ralia's strict biosecurity system, prevention of disease entering Australia can never be 100 per cent guaranteed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It is of additional concern that product originally exported to New Zealand by another country may find its way into Australia. Not all countries grow produce in accordance with Australian and New Zeal­and standards, particularly with respect to the type of chemicals used in production. They may in fact use chemicals that have been banned in Australia. The sooner we have clear country of origin labelling in place in Australia, the sooner Australian consumers will be able to make an informed choice about the products they purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Australia has a very close working relationship with New Zealand. We share food standard regulations under the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                      Food Standards Australia New Zealand
                     </a>
                     process. Both countries, however, enter into their own trade agreements with other countries, which in turn may create a pathway for non-New Zealand product which Australia has conc­erns with entering Australia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We clearly need to be vigilant in our customs and, in particular, biosecurity processes. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agree­ment attempts to define the nature of the trade between the two countries and in turn provide certainty for producers and exporters. The amendments in this bill make clearer definitions in the agreement. I commend the bill to the House.

                      New Zealand is our close neighbour, earnest rival and great friend. The rivalry we have in cricket, rugby and netball is legendary and it is mostly friendly and conducted in a manner befitting such noble sports. But it is not just in sport that Australia has close ties with our trans-Tasman neighbour. About half a million

                      s live in Australia and 65,000 Australians live in New Zealand. Twenty-three per cent, or $7.2 billion worth, of New Zealand exports end up in Australia. In return, 18 per cent of New Zealand imports originate here. On top of that, there is $6 billion worth of two-way trade in services.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The population of New Zealand is around 4.4 million, or around one-fifth of Austral­ia's, which of course means that Australia's market is a much larger and more encour­aging market for New Zealand. We both have similar histories of reliance on agriculture and, even though Australia has moved further away from this agricultural economic dominance, both nations are key exporters of agricultural products, including food. In this agricultural trade our two nations could be described as natural rivals, producing many similar products. So how do we differentiate our product in Australia, not just compared to New Zealand product but compared to product from around the world? More importantly at this point, how do we ensure that New Zealand produce is exactly that and not rebadged imports?

                     <p>
                      The Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill before the House purports to set out the rules for determining whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods and therefore eligible for a preferential rate of customs duty under the Customs Tariff Act 1995. However, in the vague laws of international trade such rules always seem open to interpretation and, in spite of the intent in this bill, indeed this seems to be the case in this bill.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is no greater acknowledgement of the lack of equity and vagaries in trade policy than the failure of the world to deliver, particularly in agriculture, through the DOHA Round of world trade talks. We really do need to ensure that this bill and any others actually enhance real trade in an open, honest and transparent manner. The Aust­ralian community needs to be assured that goods from other countries are not entering Australia branded as a product of New Zealand thanks to a brief stopover, but the bill really does not guarantee that.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Subdivision G of the act:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">

                      , which:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It goes further, in identifying that goods are not New Zealand-originating goods under this division merely because of the following operations:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      (a) operations to preserve goods in good condition for the purposes of transport or storage;
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      (b) disassembly of goods;
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      (c) affixing of marks, labels or other similar distinguishing signs on goods or their packaging;
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      (d) packaging, changes to packaging, the breaking up or assembly of packages or presenting goods for transport or sale;
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      (e) quality control inspections;

                     <p class="italic">
                      (f) any combination of operations referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e).

                     <p>
                      This suggests that goods that have been repackaged in New Zealand cannot simply be badged as a product of New Zealand and sent at reduced duty to Australia, but it does not really address partially manufactured or processed products made from foreign ingredients. The bill seeks to omit the statement:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Subdivision B provides that goods are New Zealand originating goods if they are wholly obtained in New Zealand or in New Zealand and Australia.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In turn it inserts:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      Subdivision B provides that goods are New Zealand originating goods if they are wholly obtained or produced in New Zealand or in New Zealand and Australia.

                     <p>
                      The government and the minister need to explain the exact impact of that change. I note that when the minister introduced this bill to the parliament on 16 June he explained the process by which these changes were developed but did not explain what outcomes would come about as a result of the amendments. That is something that we as parliamentarians and growers in Australia need to be aware of. The minister's speech of about four full paragraphs did not contain that sort of detail. The minister said in that speech that changes:

                     <p class="italic">

                     <p>
                      But I ask the minister to explain how the proposed changes will prevent foreign goods entering Australia through New Zealand in that so-called 'grey marketplace'.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I know that much has been said about this grey marketplace and there is quite a bit of information out there about what has gone on. I saw a

                      feature in which they investigated and tracked raw products to factories where they were processed, repackaged and exported. These products were branded with, as they said in this article, the trusty 'made in New Zealand' label. It stated that in the last year—this was 2010—officially 45 per cent was coming from New Zealand, 16 per cent from China and 12 per cent from Canada. China has more than doubled the amount of food it is sending into Australia, but that does not include food it is sending which is processed in New Zealand and then gets sent here. We hear constantly about Australian growers being unable to compete, and it comes as a result of some of this.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I need to know from the minister whether the entry of such goods will be made easier or more difficult with the proposed changes and why. We need explanations that will work in practical terms and we need to know whether any proposed reduction in administration will result in a reduction in accountability. We cannot afford to lower our standards. The other issue relating to this is food labelling. I have raised the accuracy of food labelling in this place on numerous occasions. Products coming through New Zealand to Australia must be adequately and properly labelled. As we hear frequently in this place, the quality of Australian products should not be put at risk.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is no doubt that the clean, disease-free status of Australian food and produce is absolutely paramount. That is why so many Australians are outraged at the continual undermining of our biosecurity. The govern­ment is not acting on this. The 2009 budget slashed $35.8 million from quarantine and biosecurity and we have seen $58 million slashed from the customs budget. Fewer cargo consignments are inspected and fewer vessels boarded on arrival. In 2011 another $32 million was cut from the operation of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">

                      , Fisheries and Forestry, reducing the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The latest example, which we heard today in this chamber, is the recommendation by
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                      to abandon adequate protocols to prevent the incursion of serious diseases like fire blight with the importation of New Zealand apples. This comes on the back of the Prime Minister visiting the New Zealand parliament and making an ann­ouncement that we would accept their apples. This was said without the completion of an import risk analysis. So Biosecurity Australia, in my view, has had to try to cut its cloth to fit the Prime Minister's statement. But this is an abandonment of the quarantine principles that have made Australia amongst the cleanest producers of high-quality food in the world. We know that the Beale quarantine and biosecurity review, commis­sioned by Labor, called for many millions more to be spent on

                      </a>
                      and quarantine to provide real protection for our border. But the government has failed to act and has actually stripped funding.

                     <p>
                      In relation to the apple imports, 75 per cent of
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                       Western Australia
                      </a>
                      's apples and pears are produced in my electorate. So the potential for harm to those growers and to our industry in Western Australia is signific­ant. We know that the biosecurity measures and protocols that we expect, and that are part of what we do on farm in Australia, will be less than those required in the United States. That is what will be applied to the importation of apples from New Zealand. We know that our growers are very concerned about the potential for fire blight, european canker and leaf-curling midge. It only takes that little piece of trash to come in with those apples. When we look at what is being asked of inspectors in
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
                       New Zealanders
                      </a>
                      , it could come down to as few as one apple in a million being inspected, and those apples could come from a diversity of properties.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We know that fire blight in New Zealand is not a declarable or reportable disease. So how are we going to know which orchards are affected and whether any of those apples will be coming into Australia? We know that the disease can manifest itself in the calyx, so the inspections are particularly important to maintaining our biosecurity. Unfortunate­ly, when you go to New Zealand and see how the industry runs you see that Australia's biosecurity will be in the hands of a backpacker having a great day, every day, picking and packing apples in New Zealand to be sent to Australia. I do not think that is an appropriate place for our biosecurity to rest. I think this is a very serious issue for us in Australia.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The other question that I would ask is: who is going to pay the compensation to a grower who has to get rid of their crop and pull out their trees to deal with fire blight? Who is going to be responsible for that when that comes as a result of fire blight introduced through the importation of New Zealand apples? You can understand the concerns of industry on this issue. We have enjoyed some of the most rigorous bio­security standards, but unfortunately we are now seeing that Biosecurity Australia is being asked—or instructed, I would think—to provide an import risk analysis that reflects the statement the Prime Minister made in the New Zealand parliament. That is simply not good enough. Australia produces some of the best quality food in the world—

                        would agree with this—that we can go and buy some of the best quality food in the world in our country. We seem to think that it will be there forever, but it will not be if our biosecurity is put at risk as it is being put at risk now. We take it for granted when we go to buy our fruit and vegetables at the local fruit and vegetable market, or wherever we go, that they are going to be of the quality and standard that we expect and demand and enjoy. I have great faith in our growers, but I am very concerned about the organic growers, because they cannot use strept­omycin. How does an organic grower deal with fire blight in that instance? This has the potential to do a lot of harm and it also affects a whole range of other genera. We know that well. It could well affect the cotoneaster group. There are a whole lot of ornamental pear trees as well, in a whole lot of gardens right around this nation, that could be affected by this.

                        should be applying the utmost rigour to this and not be trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. The debate on this bill covers quite a bit of ground, but it hits on the importance of biosecurity and the types of products coming to Australia, where they emanate from, how they are grown, how they are produced and whether they meet the standards that we in Australia comply with and that give us the opportunity be the producers of some of the best food in the world. This is very important in consideration of this bill, and I put those concerns on the table.

                         On 16 February this year the Prime Minister addressed the New Zealand parliament and, in an act of treachery to Australian apple-growing families, agreed to give carte blanche to allow New Zealand apples into our country. This was, in every sense, a betrayal of the worst kind—an

                         or anything else offered as some sort of feeble excuse. It is incomprehensible that our Prime Minister, as unpopular as she is in this country, would go across the Tasman to try to win a few friends over there in this way.

                         It was an executive decision to do this because in December last year the Australian and New Zealand governments agreed that a review of the situation would be completed on 17 August 2011, still many weeks from now. Despite this, our Prime Minister jumped the gun by several months and, in doing so—in wrongly doing so—opened the floodgates to New Zealand apples, placing our own apple industry in harm's way, risking fire blight and a flooded market. She did the same with live cattle exports, making an executive decision to ban the whole live trade to Indonesia, despite there being abattoirs which comply with Australian killing standards. It makes you wonder what the Prime Minister has against regional Australia.

                         On 1 June Apple and Pear Australia Ltd, APAL, which has been fighting the good fight against this Labor government's ineptitude and this Prime Minister's arro­gance, released a summary of a Centre for International Economics report commis­sioned by Horticulture Australia Ltd. The very first paragraph of the summary spells out the trouble we now face:

                         The Australian apple industry is likely to endure significant structural changes resulting from the introduction of apple imports, starting January 2011, with wholesale prices expected to be about 20 per cent lower and farm income about 30 per cent lower. Imported apples will be sold in Australia as a result of changes made by

                         The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig, attended the announcement of the report, which was made by APAL chairman Darral Ashton, of Batlow, a town in my Riverina electorate which faces a bleak outlook thanks to our Prime Minister's sell-out. I met Mr Ashton and an APAL delegation about 20 minutes ago in my office. They are very worried about Labor's attitude towards agriculture, and they have every reason to be concerned.

                         I hope the minister listened on 1 June. Moreover, I hope he takes some action to do something to help save what has been and could and should continue to be a great Australian industry, a great Australian trad­ition. I hope that, unlike with the cattle trade, Senator Ludwig does not cave in to orders from above, from a Prime Minister who puts everything into the delay basket, hoping that it gets lost in the 24-hour media cycle on which her government runs, hoping the next latte-sipping, union-grovelling, leftie focus group moves on to some other issue to appease the city dwellers or the rabid Greens to whom this Labor government is so beholden.

                         Can we afford to allow this to happen to Australian apple growers, Aussie farmers? This is the first time in 90 years that apples are being imported into Australia. It is the biggest challenge the apple industry has had to face since England joined the

                         New Zealand initially applied to export apples to Australia in December 1995. Since that time, APAL and citrus fruit growers have done their utmost to ensure that, if New Zealand apples are brought into Australia, exotic pests and diseases present in New Zealand do not also arrive on our shores and end up in our orchards and, as the member for Forrest quite rightly pointed out, in our ornamental gardens as well.

                         On 1 January 2007, the agreement's rules of origin provision underwent considerable change to permit both the 'change in tariff classification' method and the 'regional value content' method to be used to establish whether goods are New Zealand-originating goods.

                         As part of the 2007 amendments to the agreement, both parties have agreed to perform a review of the new rules of origin within three years of these new rules taking effect. However, in the same year New Zealand lodged a dispute with the World Trade Organisation on the basis that Australian measures were inconsistent with Australia's international obligations under the

                         This is a very serious subject, but I will take that interjection from the shadow minister—sorry, not shadow. He will be a shadow in the next parliament—trust me! These practices include application of the integ­rated fruit production system, or an equivalent, to manage pests and diseases in the orchards; testing to ensure that only mature fruit is exported to Australia; maintenance of sanitary conditions in dump tank water; high-pressure water washing and brushing of fruit in the packing house; and a minimum 600-fruit sample from each lot of fruit packed be inspected and found free of quarantine pests for Australia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         However, all horticultural industries in virtually all countries have standard practices designed to minimise the risk and spread of diseases. But the efficacy of those practices depends on many factors which are not always in the control of the orchardist or industry personnel. The standard practices, like any other code of practice, are open to potential flaws such as human interpretation and application of the standard practices, which invariably differ from grower to grower and from region to region. Without a significant level of auditing, there is no way of judging compliance with the standard orchard practices and, in New Zealand, there appears to be no single organisation which manages and audits the process across all export orchards to ensure accuracy and consistency and to deal with noncompliance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Pest pressure, both on-farm and from neighbouring properties, choice and efficacy of application of control agents, and orchard canopy and design are also standard practices which can be open to issue and noncompliance. While in New Zealand it is mandatory to comply with standard orchard practices if fruit is to be exported, it is not mandatory to have all aspects of the program conducted in the expected manner. Whilst the modifications to the agreement will lessen the administrative burden on business and will assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets, the amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia.

                        <p>
                         Certain industries will indeed suffer from a decrease in prices and the importation of pest and diseases. This is just another blow to Australian farmers, who must feel that under this government they cannot take a trick. Foreign apples should never have been allowed into our country in the first place. Our apple industry is free of fire blight and is self-sustaining. All this has done is undermine and potentially cripple what was a vibrant Australian industry, which meant so much to the economic prosperity of Batlow and Tumut and many other regional areas as well. We have already seen what pests and diseases such as the asian bee and greening disease can do to countries with horticulture such as citrus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Today, the shadow minister for agric­ulture and food security has circulated a private member's bill to safeguard against fire blight in the face of the Gillard government issuing permits to import apples from New Zealand. Australia's robust, science based quarantine protections must not be compromised. Our pest and disease-free status has been hard won and the government's bid to rubber-stamp New Zealand apples into Australia, without the same checks and balances that are applied to other countries, sets a very dangerous precedent.

                         inspectors on the ground in China, undertaking rigorous checks, we are expected to simply accept that practices across the Tasman in New Zealand adequately manage endemic fire blight risk in that country, despite not having a single inspector to check that the right thing is being done. Apples are apples, and the same scientific standards should be applied to apples, regardless of where they are imported from.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The coalition is so worried about the lax attitude to quarantine and biosecurity in Australia that we have put forward the Quarantine Legislation Amendment (Apples) Bill 2011, a bill which makes a permit to import apples a disallowable instrument. This bill puts the government and Biosecurity Australia on notice that, if they ignore the science and put trade before quarantine, this parliament can disallow permits and direct them to ensure that adequate protections against foreign pests and diseases are in place. Biosecurity Australia needs to clearly justify the risk factors and why Australia is allowing lower standards for New Zealand than those required to import apples from China. There is a very real risk of fire blight entering Australia and, of the 49 countries which have contracted fire blight, not one has eradicated it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Fire blight is not a notifiable disease. There has, apparently, been no serious fire blight outbreak reported in New Zealand since 1998. But how would anyone know whether one has occurred? Indeed, when Biosecurity Australia inspectors visited New Zealand in March and inspected six orchards and five packing houses they found fire blight. The reckless pursuit by the government to import New Zealand apples without adequately managing the risk of fire blight will be a death sentence for our country's apple producers. This decision to make the permit to import apples a disallowable instrument is not a decision the coalition has taken lightly, but such is the lax attitude towards biosecurity by this govern­ment that we were left with no other choice. We have a duty to proactively protect Australia's shores from pests and diseases. After all, mangoes from Queensland are placed under very strict quarantine measures by New Zealand for fear of fruit fly, yet we are not supposed to have similar tight rules to guard against fire blight from New Zealand apples. The federal government has wiped its hands of agriculture. It constantly proves this with its laxity in biosecurity laws, suspension of live exports and failure to gain an understanding of the way of rural life through listening to the people who know best. One of those people is Hannah Cathels, part of the third generation of her family to grow and sell Australian apples. She wrote to me recently, and her correspondence is worth listening to. Her uncle Ian Cathels operates three orchards in Batlow,
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                          New South Wales
                         </a>
                         , and her father, Rob, operates five divisions in the Sydney markets, where she works. The futures of her siblings and cousins, also part of that third generation, will be dramatically impacted should pests and diseases from New Zealand enter their orchards. Hannah says that this business producing and selling Australian apples has allowed her grand­father, father and uncle to provide for their family for the past 60 years, and she fears that without proper protocols in place for New Zealand apple imports she, her siblings and her cousins will not be able to do the same for their families in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In Batlow, her grandfather bought his first apple orchard and now has three orchards and a large packing shed, packing for over 20 local growers. Hannah wonders what will happen to those people if the New Zealand apples come in and flood our markets. They employ 250-plus staff in New South Wales. Consider the 250-plus staff and their families also without an income if the New Zealand apples bring pests and diseases, which will, as she says, 'decimate' her industry—what she really means is 'devastate'. It is not going to divide it by 10; it is going to completely cripple the industry. 'It is extremely hard for me to understand,' she writes, 'how Biosecur­ity Australia and the Australian government can expect us to believe or even accept that New Zealand apple growers will honestly attempt to control the entry of their pests and diseases into our country if there is no auditing process and when they stand to receive significant financial benefits through the import of their apples into our country.' The Prime Minister should heed the words of Hannah, wise beyond her 22 years, and do everything she can to protect and preserve Australia's apple industry—not simply sell it up the river in yet another cheap political stunt.

                         <p>
                          I too wish to stand to make a contribution to the debate on the Customs Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2011. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901, which addresses the rules of origin requirements under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, which came into force in 1983. The requirements are outlined in article 3 and annex G to the agreement. There are a number of specific amendments to division 1E of part
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIII" rel="nofollow">
                           VIII
                          </a>
                          of the Customs Act which insert new definitions of, for example, 'aquaculture', 'manufacture' and 'produce' as well as amend provisions for wholly obtained goods. Although aquacult­ure was included in the agreement from 2007, there was no specific definition of what was meant by the term. While 'manufacture' was defined, a number of exclusions, such as restoration or renovation processes, have now been included.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The bill also amends the provision dealing with eligibility based on the last process of manufacture. It is of course very important that we sort this issue out. The modifications to the agreement are expected to lessen the administrative burden on businesses and assist the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. It is interesting, I have to say, that we very often quote that something we do is to lessen the administrative burden, but in fact each time we say that it would seem there is an incremental increase in the number of public servants we have in this country, both state and federal.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in the agreement and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. A review was commenced in late 2008 and completed in March 2010, resulting in amendments to the text of article 3, on rules of origin, and the related product-specific rules in annex G to the agreement. In particular, the rules for determining whether the goods originate in New Zealand have been clarified. New Zealand-originating goods are eligible for a preferred rate of customs duty. In most cases this is a free rate. And there are now defined non-qualifying operations listed which will exclude items from the preferential treatment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So this is a very important bill, and the coalition is supportive of making sure all of those definitions are refined and the smooth operation of the closer economic relationship occurs. But there are very serious concerns about our interactions now and the trade between the two countries,
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          . One of these is very close to my interests, for example the announcement the other day that the Heinz tomato sauce factory at Girgarre is closing and will go to New Zealand. It will go there and work out of a factory it already owns, but it is going to produce tomato sauce and tomato ketchup in New Zealand, despite that country not growing the tomatoes which are required for their manufacture. So it is going to be interesting to see just how the country-of-origin labelling will work. Wherever the tomato paste is imported from into New Zealand for their tomato sauce manufacture in the future—whether it comes from China, South Africa, Chile or wherever the cheapest going rate for the commodity is for the year—it will be very important that our country-of-origin information on those labels reflects absolutely and accurately all of the realities about that Big Red Tomato Sauce bottle sitting on the barbecue. Clearly, there are all sorts of interesting ways that one could understand a marketing advantage, if there is in fact a label which simply says 'Product of New Zealand'.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We also have a major concern in Australia right now about how our closer economic relationship is working and how, despite us having this extraordinarily close relationship with New Zealand, both countries still must be guardians of their quarantine status. In the case of Australia we are an island nation—as is New Zealand—but our quarantine services have managed to guard us from so many diseases which sadly, indeed tragically for New Zealand, has not been their experience. For example, New Zealand almost a century ago had the dreaded apple fire blight come into their country—probably from plant stock from the United States. The disease is one of the serious problems for pome fruit, and it also affects rosaceae species—and in Australia that includes a number of native species besides your good old-fashioned rose bush growing in your garden. Plants like cotoneaster are also vulnerable to fire blight. We had an extraordinary situation in Australia some 12 or 13 years ago, so we know what it feels like to have an incursion of fire blight, in Victoria at least. We know the costs to the industry. We know the damage it does to the reputation of apple and pear producers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I stress the word 'pear' because unfortunately fire blight does not simply affect apples. We know that you can have an apple industry with fire blight—obviously New Zealand is an example of this. Fire blight affects the apple orchards of lots of countries around the world, and those countries continue to have a viable industry. But you do not have viable pear industries where you have fire blight. With apples, you can just keep chainsawing off the dead and dying limbs that have been affected by the bacteria, but when it comes to pears the tree is killed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In my electorate of Murray we grow 80 per cent of Australia's pears. We also grow a substantial proportion of the apples of the nation. The pears are vital for our fruit manufacturing. They are the equivalent of the building block of much of our manufactured food product, whether it is baby foods, sauces or preserved fruits. If we have our pear trees, our pear orchards, wiped out by this disease, there are serious implications for fruit and food manufacturing in the 23 food factories in my electorate. We employ thousands of people, not just directly as they move a product from farm to factory but also in transporting that product to the markets around Australia and indeed to the rest of the world.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Pears are vital to the continuing viability of Australia's food manufacturing. Pears are killed by the apple fire blight disease. It is not just a case of getting out the chainsaw and regularly cutting your trees where the fire blight affects them. It is not a case either of saturating the trees with streptomycin sprays, which is what New Zealand does. In Australia we are very fussy about the chemicals that we put on our plants and that we might inoculate our animals with and we do not want to have to use streptomycin, currently a prohibited substance in our orchards on our food products. But that is what the

                          s are forced to do to try and keep their disease in check.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Also, it is not just a case of our orchards being vulnerable. We have a Mediterranean climate in northern Victoria—and in places like Harcourt, in the seat of Bendigo, where of course those apple orchardists are absolutely beside themselves about the decision of this government to allow imports of fresh apples to Australia. We also have a huge threat to crop pollination through the demise of our bee industry. The apiculture industry is at risk from fire blight. Any outbreak would potentially devastate the livelihood of the hundreds of commercial beekeepers in Australia. Worse than that, it would wipe out our capacity to naturally pollinate our commercial and non-commercial species throughout Australia.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Honey bees are the major vector for fire blight bacteria spores. Just as pollen grains adhere to the bees' bodies, so too do the fire blight bacterial spores. They are spread from flower to flower, from orchard to orchard and from bee to bee. There is a fire blight contingency plan in Australia. It was developed prior to the 1997 scare, which I have referred to. The fire blight contingency plan for Australia calls for the destruction of all beehives in a declared fire blight quarantine area.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Honey bees, as I am sure most of us in this chamber know, are the efficient pollinators of food crops for Australia. Currently there are over 40,000 managed beehives engaged in contract pollination across Victoria. That includes crops of apples, pears, almonds, cherries, kiwifruit and a whole range of small seeds and nuts. The almond industry in particular is totally dependent on bee pollination. We had a major disaster recently with beehive popul­ations being killed by the floods, and we are already suffering the consequences of that as we wait for those hives to be rebuilt. Imagine the disaster: fire blight in Australia equals the destruction of beehives in the pome fruit areas.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The apiculture industry is extraordinarily exercised and concerned about this problem. Streptomycin—which is, as I have said, an accepted form of antibiotic control for fire blight in New Zealand—also poses a major risk to the apiculture, or beekeeping, industry. This antibiotic control, if it were to be allowed into Australia, would be a major problem for the bee industry. This antibiotic has been banned in Australia for the treatment of bee diseases for many years. Streptomycin does not break down. If sprayed on fruit blossoms it would be collected by honey bees in the nectar secreted by the plant and become a chemical contaminant in the honey. In addition to the negative impact of fire blight on beekeepers' livelihoods, which is one thing, this contaminant would also damage the clean image of Australia's honey in both domestic and export markets.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Fire blight is not just a problem for the pome fruit industry of Australia, particularly pears but, of course, also apples. It is a problem because fresh fruit imports from New Zealand also carry other pest species. They were well understood and explained in the W

                          investigations, plus the appeals which the Australian government brought when we lost the case initially for trying to ban fresh apple imports from New Zealand. Those other pest species, if they got out of control, would affect not just the pome fruit industry but also cereals and other horticultural crops—a serious problem for us.

                          , the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, in charge of the process—apparently—of oversighting merely the domestic protocols that are to be put into force in New Zealand. Whatever the orchards have to do to sell their boxes of apples from Auckland to Wellington, apparently those same rules and procedures will be okay when the product is sent across to Australia. We find this a complete abrogation of the responsibility of a country. Never before has the Australian government allowed the domestic protocols existing in a country to be used as the export protocol equivalency.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We just wonder: was it to do with that speech the Prime Minister made and got the standing ovation for in the parliament of New Zealand a few months ago? Is that why this government has capitulated and allowed the local primary producers of apples in New Zealand to simply stick the fruit in a box, with a bit of trash if it happens to be there, plonk it on a truck and then into a container to send it across the sea with the fresh apple and accompanying bacterial spores ready for release into the Australian environment? It is a shocking dilemma for Australian primary producers. I have recommendations from the Turnbull Brothers Orchards, particularly Chris Turnbull. His recommendations are about the quarantine practices that would replace the domestic protocols which this government has said it does not really care about or is not fussed about—'They will do.' He says there must be more inspections of New Zealand orchards, increasing inspect­ions from one to three between flowering and harvesting to ensure there are no outbreaks of fire blight or european canker in the months before
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                           Biosecurity Australia
                          </a>
                          's proposed single inspection. Blocks where there are symptoms of fire blight or evidence of fire blight being removed should be excluded from export to Australia. Blocks where there has been an outbreak of fire blight should be excluded from the Australian market for two years. Packing lines should be fully disinfected by steam cleaning before being used to pack fruit for Australia. He recommends more rigorous inspections for potentially bacteria-carrying plant trash, an increase in the rate of inspections from 600 apples to 600 cartons, and scientific investigation to determine the actual risks of fire blight and european canker in areas of New Zealand where Biosecurity Australia currently guesses the risk.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Turnbull Brothers have been established since 1892 with orchards in the

                          </a>
                          . They know their business. They are committed to intergenerational growing of fruit which is healthy with a clean green image and where the orchard can be sustained year after year because it is healthy and does not require the use of currently condemned chemicals. So we have here Mr Chris Turnbull proposing other measures.

                          Today in this parliament we have had the Quarantine Legislation Amendment (Apples) Bill put forward by the shadow agriculture minister calling for a disallowable instrument in a desperate move to try and get this government to see reason, not to expose our country to a disease which is incurable, has never been cured in any country where it has taken hold. We have fresh apple imports from China. It is not the issue of fresh apple imports that is the problem; it is the importation of fruit which is a known carrier of an incurable disease and a bacteria which will feel very at home once it is able to get loose into our Australian Mediterranean climate.

                           said there were 1,200 reasons why New Zealand would not become part of the Australian Federation but that he wished the colonies that were entering Federation all the best. Those 1,200 reasons, of course, were the 1,200 miles across the Tasman—across the ditch, as people say. I think that everyone would agree, though, that continental Australia and New Zealand can boast one of the best relationships in an international sense.

Unfortunately that has not yet been achieved, but I believe that the closer economic relationship ought to be advanced substan­tially so that we are able to attain something like a joint market across the Tasman. While I understand the concerns of the member for Murray in relation to the products from her electorate, I think it is vital to recognise that Australasia is in fact an entity and if there is a problem on one side of the Tasman then those on the other side of the Tasman should join in attempting to solve it.

We had a reference from the then minister, the member for Berowra, to look at harmonisation of laws within Australia and between Australia and New Zealand. Our committee made a whole series of recomm­endations, some of which were accepted by the government and some of which were not, which could have led to levels of greater integration, from possibly becoming one country through to a confederation through to sharing a telecommunications market and maybe having a common currency through to a whole range of issues. There are many levels of integration short of New Zealand becoming part of Australia.

                           I support this bill. I think it is a very positive step. Australia and New Zealand share so many things, including a love of freedom and honour for our countries—a fact borne out by the Anzac legend. We exchange students, we exchange tourists, we share a love of sports like rugby union, cricket and even rugby league and we share some legal frameworks and business relations. We even joke about each other, and if there is one thing that is an indicator of friendship and respect it is being able to share a good-hearted joke at each other's expense.

                           and a number of other people. There was discussion in relation to the way forward. I do not believe that New Zealand should be forced into a relationship with Australia which reduces New Zealand to a state. There are many levels of integration short of that, which I think is something we want to achieve. When one looks at what the

                           has been able to attain, given the history of Europe, particularly in the 20th century, surely it should be so much easier for the Australian states and New Zealand to be able to come to some suitable accommodation. It really is not a matter at issue in this parliament that we need a closer relationship with New Zealand. This bill is a very positive step forward, though I believe it is simply an incremental step forward and that there is very much a greater distance to travel. We are similar people with similar values and we get on very well together. Put differently, we are the same people, some of whom happen to carry a New Zealand passport and others of whom carry an Australian passport. When one looks at the natural tragedies we have had on this side of the Tasman and the support we got from New Zealand, and similarly with the earthquakes in New Zealand and the support that came from this side of the Tasman, the suggestion that we are two separate count­ries, while legally accurate, is one which does not, in the mind, I think, convince many people. Most Australians would consider

                           s to be kith and kin, and the relationship between Australia and New Zealand is not really an international relationship; it is a domestic regional relationship and one that we ought to encourage.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This bill modifies the Customs Act 1901 to bring in changes to the rules of origin provisions, which are outlined in the key trade agreement between our two nations, the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. The changes afforded by this bill today result from a review and amendments to the trade agreement in 2007, when it was agreed that a further review would be conducted three years later, in 2010. These changes are mostly technical in nature, inserting and amending definitions and making clarific­ations. The changes will improve the efficient running of the agreement.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The need for such modifications is a positive symptom of a document that is getting good use. The agreement is nearing 30 years old and needs to be tweaked from time to time. To be honest, it is probably regrettable that Australia and New Zealand have not moved further. Thirty years ago this was a land-breaking agreement, but many other countries have been able to come to other agreements and they have bypassed us because we simply have not been prepared to grasp the nettle and move forward as we should.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The changes in this bill include inserting definitions for the terms 'aquaculture', 'manufacture' and 'produce' as well as amending the provisions dealing with 'wholly obtained goods' and also amending the provisions that deal with eligibility of the last process of manufacture. For example, the previous version of the agreement included aquaculture as an eligible activity but it did not include an actual definition of aquaculture, so that is an anomaly which the provisions of this bill will address. Further, this bill modifies the definition of 'manufacture' to also include activities that may not have previously come under the banner of manufacturing, such as restoration or renovation processes. The definition for 'produce' is modified to remove the refer­ences to 'disassemble', substituting it with the terms 'restore or renovate'. This is relevant in that, under the definition of 'produce', goods needed to be entirely produced in New Zealand from materials sourced in New Zealand or Australia. However, in previous versions of the agreement, items that were disassembled and/or reassembled in New Zealand could slip through and inadvertently be labelled as 'Made in New Zealand', which was inaccurate. This has sensibly been changed—a change that will bring integrity to the agreement with respect to making New Zealand and Australian goods.

                          <p>
                           While I support this bill, I think the necessity for this bill indicates that we still have a long way to go. The fact that we are talking about this bill indicates that, as two nations, we have failed the challenge of bringing our economies together. We have failed the challenge of putting aside the fact that there might be 1,200 miles between the former British colony in Australia and the former British colony in New Zealand. The fact that we are in a sense wasting so much bureaucratic time on talking about these matters, as though we are perpetually going to be two separate countries, I think is eminently regrettable.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           It is incumbent on governments on both sides of the Tasman to accept a challenge that was made by former Prime Minister Rudd in talking about an ever-closer relationship between New Zealand and the Australian states. We share a history, we share geography, we share destiny and we share values. While this bill is worthy of support, much more has to be done.

The changes facilitate trade by providing importers and exporters of both countries with greater clarity and certainty about the rules of origin.

                            is Australia’s longest standing bilateral free trade agreement, having been in force since 1983. Article 3 of ANZCERTA deals with rules of origin, which determine the eligib­ility of goods for preferential tariff treatment under the agreement. Such rules prevent the benefits of trade agreement tariff commit­ments extending to goods produced or manufactured in countries other than those who are party to the agreement. The current ANZCERTA rules of origin entered into force on 1 January 2007. In negotiating these rules both countries agreed to include in ANZCERTA a provision requiring the review of rules of origin within three years of the new rules taking effect. Australian and New Zealand officials commenced the review in late 2008 and completed it in March 2010, resulting in agreement to make amendments to the text of ANZCERTA article 3, rules of origin, and the related product specific rules in annex G.

                            The changes to ANZCERTA will reduce the administrative burden on business and will facilitate the eligibility for duty-free entry of goods into both markets. The amendments will also provide greater consistency between the rules of origin in ANZCERTA and those in other free trade agreements entered into by Australia. This bill is the legislative vehicle for domestic implementation of the ANZCERTA article 3 changes.

If enacted, this bill will amend the National Health and Hospitals and Network Act by changing its title to the National Health Reform Act 2011. Still to come is further legislation that will establish a third statutory authority, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority.

                             All of this legislation arises out of the convoluted so-called health reform engin­eered by former Prime Minister
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
                              Kevin Rudd
                             </a>
                             —I am very pleased to have him in the chamber listening to this speech today—and Minister Roxon at the height of their reform frenzy last year preceding Mr Rudd's most undignified demise at the hands of the current Prime Minister. Both Mr Rudd and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, promised at the time that these changes would not lead to further bureauc­racy in the health sector—clearly yet another hollow promise from this Labor government, for here the parliament is being asked to grow the bureaucracy with the first of two new authorities and the attendant boards, secretariats and associated staff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             When the initial bill was introduced last year the coalition called for the government to provide all the provisions to establish all of these bodies at the one time so that the House, the stakeholders and the community could see the full intent of the government and, crucially, see exactly the interaction between these bodies. As is usual for this health minister, what we have is a piecemeal approach of bill after bill and amendment after amendment with all the attendant risks for poor outcomes as this minister tries to get it right. That is what we see here today—page after page of amendments to the legislation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I will come to those amendments later. They are a humiliating rebuttal of this government and this minister—the minister for health is having to stand in this House and introduce amendments which clearly say she cannot be trusted to run the nation's health system, and the states will ensure that she does not get the opportunity to step in and override their authority. First, though, it is worth recounting very quickly the history relating to this bill, the authority it creates and the warnings and concerns that have been sounded loudly. It is an outstanding example of the ineptitude of this govern­ment. When the minister introduced the initial bill, the National Health and Hospitals Network Bill, in September last year, as with virtually anything this government attempts to do with health it was described as historic and delivering on the government's health reform agenda. Of course the so-called health reform agenda was somewhat different back then. These were the Rudd-Roxon reforms and, as the minister told the House, they were all about a hospitals network that would be funded nationally and run locally. At that time now Prime Minister

                               We all know that standing by commitments and promises to the Australian people is not a high priority for this Prime Minister or indeed her government. Her actions in health are every bit as egregious as the reversal of her promise that no government she led would introduce a carbon tax—a tax the Australian people do not want but one she steadfastly insists upon inflicting on them by mid next year.

It remains to be seen whether Ms Gillard's efforts will survive longer than her predeces­sor's, for all she has at the moment is an agreement to reach an agreement and she is still negotiating with the states to get a final deal. We will see the final outcome at the next COAG meeting, whenever that might be, but, as the amendments now before the House make clear, the states are not accepting Labor's so-called reforms. We know that in the last 24 hours the planned COAG meeting has been delayed because they cannot get agreement—

                                 From its humble beginnings, the Mudgeeraba Show has now grown into a two-day weekend event, labelled as the 'little Ekka' with more than 15,000 Gold Coasters turning up on the first day this year, giving a welcome boost the local economy. The event hosts horse events, handicrafts, horticultural exhibits, cooking and preserves, a pet parade, wood chopping, ring events and a showgirl pageant, to name but a few. The show would not be a success without the force of the community supporting it. The volunteers and the public ensure the event continues. I look forward to attending it next year and I encourage everyone to join me.

                                   I rise to make a statement about the deadly hendra virus. I know that the minister at the table, the member for Griffith, would be well familiar with the hendra virus in Queensland. The hendra virus is spread from fruit bats or flying foxes, via their secretions, to horses and then to humans. It is a deadly virus that has already taken the lives of four Queenslanders in recent years. There is a recent outbreak in northern

                                   and in the southern parts of Queensland.

                                  <p>
                                   I hope the Prime Minister and the government are listening, because what we need to do is provide some $250,000 for protective clothing for the veterinarians and their staff who have to go to the suspected outbreaks and deal with those horses. Right now there are some 17 Queenslanders who are basically sitting on death row, wondering whether they have contracted this deadly disease. I am sure all of us in this place hope that they get a negative result from the tests that are currently being carried out. We also need to make sure that these kits are available in the vehicles of these veterinarians for use by them and their staff when they go to the suspected outbreaks.

                                   The other thing we need to do is fast track the vaccine that is being developed by the

                                   as quickly as possible because that is another way of breaking the cycle between bats, horses and humans, and it will ultimately save lives. We need to make sure that this is done quickly and I call on the government to act on this deadly disease.

                                     Austin Cove Baptist College was opened on 2 February 2011 and immediately the school community was tested with the unfortunate passing of Lauren Ames, a 13-year-old student, in a tragic car accident. Also, early on the morning on 4 May 2011, an explosion ripped through a tent in a Mandurah caravan park, in which a family was temporarily staying while the father dealt with financial issues. Tragically, all three family members perished. The youngest victim, 13-year-old Georgie Spies, was a student at Austin Cove Baptist College. Soon afterwards, a popular parent of a student passed away.

                                     Austin Cove's Principal, Orlando dos Santos, is a fantastic leader of the school. After the fallout from the tragedies became clear, students and staff were obviously having a difficult time processing the heartbreaking events. So Mr dos Santos applied to the National School Chaplaincy Program—a marvellous program started by the Howard government. On 13 May 2011, I wrote to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the Hon.

                                     , seeking his urgent intervention because the school needed support. After seven weeks of hounding Minister Garrett's office, I finally got an answer:

                                     Whilst I am sympathetic to the needs expressed by Mr dos Santos, the pressures on the Budget are significant and there is no latitude—

                                     basically, the answer was no. This is a very unfortunate, substandard, lazy, dismissive and indifferent response. It is indicative of the minister's own abilities and is symptomatic of a federal government which has completely lost touch with the Australian community.

                                      It is with great pleasure I rise today to congratulate my constituent Jeeven Nadanakumar for winning the inaugural national My First Speech Competition for Young Australians. The competition gave young Australians the opportunity to outline in three minutes their vision for their communities as if giving their first speech to parliament—and the members for Moreton, Richmond and I are very afraid. In his entry, Jeeven—who is in the chamber today with his family; welcome—outlined a strong vision for the future of Canberra and the country. He articulated values close to my heart and to many in this chamber. He talked about the virtues of Canberra and the value of small business and multiculturalism. He spoke about the need for every Australian to get quality education and health care. He also spoke of his passion for the environment and the need for a sustainable Australia. In just three minutes, he eloquently articulated his vision—one which I suspect many in this House, including me, would struggle with.
                                     </p>

                                      It is quite clear from his entry and his extracurricular activities that Jeeven is an individual who will never be content to sit by and let others do what must be done. He will always act for the benefit of his community. Congratulations, Jeeven. You should be proud of your achievements. I hope you continue with your passionate advocacy for your community. Also, congratulations to the teachers at

                                       Today in Australia's north, farmers will start shooting cattle. Tonight in Indonesia, children will go to bed hungry. It is a national disgrace that this government will not resume the live cattle export trade to those abattoirs which comply with Australian killing standards. Waiting to board ships there are Australian cattle which could be sent to Australian-owned feedlots in Indon­esia and killed according to international animal welfare standards. However, the issue has been put into the Labor government's ever-growing delay basket. The Labor government says they want to trace these animals and that that is the important issue. Well, they will be able to trace them all the way to the pits where these dead animals will be dumped. Meanwhile, people go hungry.

                                       Labor's refusal to do anything positive about this issue beggars belief and will cost this country jobs and millions of dollars. This has caused a diplomatic debacle which will have long-term repercussions. Labor's way is to turn it into a welfare issue by offering a $30 million compensation pack­age. What is needed is the immediate resumption of trade to those abattoirs which comply with Australian standards—that is, killing by stunning. Last week, I attended the Tumbarumba branch of the

Many other local beef producers have also told me they cannot understand why the Gillard government will not listen to reason. Rest assured, I will continue to lobby for the immediate resumption of the trade to abattoirs which comply with our animal welfare standards.

In a period of 12 years they have raised $2 million from their efforts and each year they contribute $250,000 between Camden and Campbelltown hospitals. Also, they created the children's gardens at Campbelltown Hospital, updated the training of medical employees and raised money towards community health centres. Under the leadership of Bruce Hanrahan they have managed, with the support of Bottlemart, Macarthur Travel, various clubs in the region, Woolworths and the

                                        One of the cultures of the Campbelltown region which I have not previously witnessed is an attitude that money raised within the region should stay there. The Macarthur area is very separate and endeavours there should go to local purposes, thereby engendering far more local support. The latest venture is to build a charity house which will later be auctioned. This project has had help from Fairmont Homes and Dart West Develop­ments, who are basically doing things at cost. There is also significant support from some volunteers in the region.

                                                  He can start by apologising to everybody that he told about a 6.5c a litre increase in the price of petrol—wholly untrue and something that the Leader of the Opposition has been around the country trying to raise fear about. As I am around the country talking to Australian workers and Australian families about the facts on carbon pricing, I hope the Leader of the Opposition is out telling them the facts about his 'subsidy for polluters' plan and, most particularly, the entry on page 14 that records his plan to penalise businesses, to put penalties on them. I hope he is out and about telling Australian workers whether it is their business that he is going to put a penalty on. I hope he is out and about telling Australian families about the cost impacts which will flow through to them because of those penalties and I hope he tells those families that he is not proposing to give them any assistance at all, that what he wants to do is take $720 off them and give it to big polluters. I hope he is out and about with those facts.

                                                  I will be out and about talking to people about the truth about carbon pricing; about the science and the need to act; about the imposition of a price on the biggest polluters in this country, on big businesses; about the way that will enable them to innovate and cut carbon pollution; about the jobs that our clean energy future will promise this country; about the tax cuts and increases in pensions and payments for Australian families; about the measures to protect Australian jobs and the measures to tackle climate change. I will certainly be very proud to be out and about talking about those facts.

                                                        Order! I declare a general warning and I am very serious about it. The first question from the Leader of the Opposition was met with great noise from my right and, equally, the response from the Prime Minister was met with great noise from my left. I have a sense that members in this chamber are really ignoring how we are perceived from outside. I do not need people's assistance about naming people; you are now all under a warning. I will simply respond to the Leader of the House's point of order by saying, yes, there is a limit to my tolerance about argument in questions but there was such uproar that, whilst I had a feeling where the question was going, I did not hear it. But I say to the Leader of the Opposition that there is a limit even to the licence that is given to leaders of parties.

I will be out and about talking about the challenge that climate change poses to the future of our nation. I accept the science. I will be out and about talking to Australians about the most efficient way of tackling carbon pollution. I accept the expert advice of economists. I will be talking to them—

I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is very lucky. I want to operate a chamber that can work and I am not sure that, if I were to take the appropriate action against him, we would have the chamber. My tolerance is at its complete limit. That was not a point of order, and I think that these types of actions should be quietened down. The Prime Minister has the call; she will be heard in silence.

                                                               I understand that Australian families have legitimate concerns about job security. There is nothing more important to people than having the benefits of work. Consequently, I will be explaining to them how the carbon pricing package will protect Australian jobs today and ensure that our nation is prosperous and has the benefits of a clean-energy future.
                                                              </p>

                                                               I will of course be speaking to Australians about any issue they want to raise with me. I suspect that they will want to raise issues with me about what was said during the election campaign, and I will be happy to answer their questions. I will be happy to explain to them that the carbon tax is temporary and that the emissions trading scheme is permanent. I will be happy to explain to them that I always wanted to achieve an emissions trading scheme for this nation, and we will. I will be happy to explain to them that we have got there via a different route than the one I foresaw at the election campaign, but we will seize that clean-energy future.
                                                              </p>

                                                               I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition was a member of the Howard cabinet that authorised an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition has been in favour of an emissions trading scheme and in favour of a carbon tax. I will be explaining to them that he is now opposed to a carbon tax and he is now opposed to an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that that is not leadership. Leadership is about saying to the country that we have to chart the best course for the future. Leadership is about saying to the country that there are difficult things we need to do in order to do the right thing by our environment and by our economy for the future.
                                                              </p>

                                                               I will be saying to the country that, as a nation, as a people we are up to doing this together. The time to do it is now. Our economy is strong, and while our economy is strong is the right time to be addressing a major reform. Nothing hard gets easier because you leave it in the too-hard basket, so I will be explaining to them that, as Prime Minister, I intend to lead this nation through this difficult reform. It will strengthen us for the future and we will get it done.

We on this side of the House have understood for a long time the dangers of ignoring climate change in terms of our environment and our economy. We have understood the need to tackle climate change in the most cost-efficient way possible. We also understand that, if you put a price on carbon pollution, you have to assist households and you have to support jobs. We are putting a price on carbon pollution, to be paid by up to 1,000 of our largest polluters.

That is why we are seeing such strong support from the business community for a price on carbon pollution. Overnight, 55 companies have come out in support of putting a price on carbon pollution—companies such as

That is why on this side of the House we understand that we must make this transition to a clean energy future. As we make that transition we do have to provide support to households. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts, increased payments and pension increases. Of course we will provide additional assistance to those on the lowest incomes.

Of course that money will go directly to the biggest polluters in the country.

You certainly cannot say that you care about cost-of-living pressures when you are going to slug households $720. Of course we all know that the Leader of the Opposition has no respect for economists and those on his backbench have no respect for his economics as well because we have a new underground econ­omic policy group, which has been formed by the member for Higgins, because they are so aghast at the lack of any alternative economic policy from the opposition benches.

I think it is very important that there is a shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change. Where that shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change leads us is that we live in a world where, as a result of human activity and the way we live today—the industr­ialised high-energy way we live today—we generate more carbon pollution than at any other time in human history. What that means is that there is a level of damage already done which we cannot unthink or undo. There is a level of damage that lies in front of us and we can make a difference to that—that is, we can act to cut carbon pollution. Rather than saying, as a nation, that we are prepared to just allow whatever the future gives us in terms of levels of carbon pollution with all of the danger that that would create for our nation, we can act to reduce those levels of carbon pollution. I believe in doing that. I believe as a nation which is amongst the 20 biggest polluters in our world, we should be acting to cut carbon pollution.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      I am a little bit surprised about this question because I would have to say that, unless there has been a big change in opposition policy, I thought members of the opposition said that they supported cutting carbon pollution too. Maybe I am wrong about that. I know, of course, that climate change scepticism has swept through the Liberal Party and claimed the Leader of the Opposition, so now maybe they reject the need to do anything about carbon pollution and simply deny its existence.

They reject the science out of hand and they reject the existence of carbon pollution out of hand. But we, on this side of the parliament, accept the science. We believe we should act to reduce carbon pollution. We accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by pricing carbon. Then, of course, because we want as a Labor government to look after those in our community who need the most assistance, we will ensure that the money polluters pay funds tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households.
                                                                         </p>

He needs to make a comparison between tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households versus the plan of the Leader of the Opposition to charge households an extra $720 per year in tax, something that would impact on people's cost of living.

I do not know how many businesses in his electorate would get which size penalty. He may have to ask the Leader of the Opposition about that and how many of them it would drive out of business. I cannot help him with that; it is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, the penalty put on businesses would flow through presumably to the prices that they charge and into cost of living pressures. He may ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about that as well because the Leader of the Opposition wants to make a charge of $720 per family. He has this plan for penalties, rising cost-of-living pressures and he is planning no assistance. In fact he is planning to take back the tax cuts and pension increases that this government will provide.

That is very important for Australia because that is about jobs, exports and revenue. That importantly is related to our capacity to invest in a nation in fundamental government services such as education, health and child care.

I firstly refer to the latest ABARES data estimates. They show a 24 per cent increase in export earnings from energy commodities in 2010-11 to $71 billion in 2011. They then suggest a further 25 per cent increase in 2011-12 to $89 billion; interestingly driven by thermal coal, up 31 per cent to $18.3 billion; and metallurgical coal up 31 per cent to $31.9 billion. I understand economic figures bore the Leader of the Opposition, because they actually tell the real story.
                                                                                </p>

                                                                                 In terms of future expansion of the industry, it even looks brighter—a forecast increase in exploration expenditure on coal of 12 per cent. We are, and we will continue to be, the world's largest exporter of coal and so we should be. Prices are high and there is significant investment in Australia. It is our responsibility to grab these economic opportunities whilst they are there for Australia to grab.
                                                                                </p>
                                                                                <p>
                                                                                 Just think about this: metallurgical coal prices have seen recent historic highs at $330 a tonne, thermal coal prices reached a record $131 a tonne, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk down the future of the coal industry in Australia that is not only economically significant to the nation at large but very significant to the economic opportunities in a range of key regions in many states and territories of Australia. I compare those prices to 10 years ago: in terms of coking coal, $50 a tonne—a sixth of what they are today; and thermal coal worth around $7 billion—a third of their predicted value today. You can see why this industry is important to Australia. Predictions are that these prices will continue and, more importantly, the pipeline of investment shows a huge potential expansion not only in the coal industry historically, in Australia, in areas such as the Hunter and the

                                                                                </p>

It is about our resource and energy sectors driving our future and they will continue to expand. Just think about the expansion of jobs. The expansion of this industry is creating new jobs. The mining industry took on an extra 35,200 workers in the year to May of this year. From our point of view, the government understands the importance of the coal industry. It also accepts that it has a very bright future. This is about jobs, exports and revenues, and it is about our capacity as a nation to look after the broader Australian community and to invest in services such as health, education and child care. We do not find economics boring—the Leader of the Opposition might—because this is fundam­ental to our economy. Start talking about the coal industry's bright future from the Leader of the Opposition's point of view rather than talking down investment and jobs in Aust­ralia.

He is one of a number of members on all sides of the House, people of all political persuasions, who have personally raised with me concerns about the live cattle trade. Many people representing electorates that are home to numbers of producers want to know, understandably and somewhat anxiously, when the trade will be resumed. We are working hard and progress is being made to achieve our goal of having the trade resumed in circumstances where we can track and trace where Australian cattle are going and the conditions under which they are slaughtered in the abattoirs that they go to in Indonesia. Progress is being made. We do need to continue to work hard on this. As progress is being made there are some more things to do, but I can certainly say to the member for New England that we are not letting a day go by, an hour go by, so that this trade is not suspended for longer than it needs to be. I understand the pressure that is putting on the shoulders of people in the live cattle industry. We are of course working with people in the live cattle industry to meet their needs and concerns at this time. There is a $5 million animal welfare package and a $30 million industry support fund. I know that some owners and growers have been distressed. There was, for example, a gentleman in

The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry ensured that he was contacted by the Cattle Council and by Centrelink so he could take full advantage of the support packages that are available to him. We will continue to work with the cattle industry, making those support packages available as we continue to work hard to resume this trade. I want to resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed.

Last week the government announced reforms, indeed 29 improvements, to strengthen the antidumping regime in this country. Those improvements will see greater resources and more expertise dedicated to investigating cases of dumping which may affect Australian businesses and Australian jobs. We will extend 'material injury' to ensure the remedy is commensurate with damage endured by local businesses, we will enable businesses to access measures more rapidly, we will speed up the process, we will allow greater transparency and we will prevent companies from circumventing duties by disaggregating or aggregating imported goods.

These long overdue reforms are needed because those opposite neglected this area of reform while they were in government. For more than a decade these reforms were required, but the previous government did nothing. They did not listen to industry and they did not listen to workers in this country in order to provide that support. Instead, the Leader of the Opposition decided to set up a task force in opposition—he should have been supporting industry and workers in government—led by the member for Indi, of all people, to go around the country to promise everything but deliver nothing.

I am very proud to say that today I introduced into the parliament the world's first legislation for the plain packaging of tobacco products. This legislation means that all tobacco products sold in Australia will, in the future, have no industry logos, no brand imagery, no colours and no promotional text. They will just be in a drab, dark brown pack with health warnings that will cover 75 per cent of the front of the pack and 90 per cent of the back of the pack. Those who manufacture, sell or distribute tobacco products could face fines of over a million dollars if they breach this legislation. I am pleased to say that at last the Leader of the Opposition—although he has been dragged kicking and screa­ming—has indicated that the Liberal Party will support this measure, which I hope will be followed through on. However, I did notice last night in the House that the member for Mitchell put on the record his opposition to these measures. He outed himself as one of the supporters of tobacco in the Liberal Party room. He said that plain packaging was 'an example of ill thought-out proposals put forward by government committees' and that this was 'a ridiculous form of nanny state legislative response to ordinary, everyday problems'.

I have indicated that the complication for any occupant of the chair is to allow debate either way. You know that I have perhaps been easier than I should have been about debate within the questions. When you look at the standing orders—and this is my reading of them—if debate is directly relevant, it is allowable. On this occasion, I would say to the minister that she should relate her material in a directly relevant manner in her response. I would not want to be a member of the commentariat who indicated that I did not think it was relevant to mention the member for Mitchell in a question that talked about glamour, but I think we do know that there has to be a confinement in the response to its direct relevance.

What the member for Mitchell said was that he did not think this sort of legislation was a decent response to 'ordinary, everyday problems'. The reason I quote this is that I take issue with the inference that it is ordinary, everyday Australians who are the ones who are not being harmed; in fact, 15,000 Australians each and every year who still die from tobacco related illnesses. If that number was distributed, the member for Mitchell, like every member in this House, would see on average 100 people die every year in his electorate because of tobacco related illnesses. I think that is an everyday problem that ordinary Australians do face and it is why we are taking action on plain packaging.

And we know why they are reluctant converts, because they are receiving thousands and thousands of dollars in donations all the time and they are embarrassed about it. The member for Goldstein, the member for Indi, the member for Sturt are all receiving thousands of dollars in donations still, and that is why they are so reluctant to support this legislation.

One would have noticed that many people either in the chamber or in the galleries—I do not know what is going out on the air—probably did not hear the conclusion of the answer because I allowed, even though there was a general warning, a response that, having been here for 25 years, I understood the answer would get. I indicate that the question about whether the minister had concluded was to ascertain whether it had to be brought to a conclusion by the chair. You can scratch it on a barrel that I sat a minister down; I do not really mind. I am again indicating that, whilst it might be considered by some to be over the top and it might be considered debate over and above what one would expect in response, once debate is allowed in the responses this is what is going to happen.

I think that the problem we have not got our heads around is that if you want to have question and answer, have a question and have an answer; do not have debate entwined in it and do not have things being done to get 10-second grabs for other purposes. The member for Forrest has the call, and I expect that the whole chamber will take note, as has been described, of the circumstances that we find ourselves in.

One of the biggest costs in his small business is electricity, because he refrigerates thousands of litres of milk every day. Does the Treasurer expect him to absorb the cost of the carbon tax, or will this cost simply be passed on to the consumer through higher prices for milk?

We have made it very clear that all of the detail for pricing carbon will be provided on Sunday. We have made it very clear that we will be putting a price on carbon pollution on up to 100—sorry, up to 1,000—

I simply say, on behalf of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that when you were speaking earlier on the point of order that I made, the minister for health interjected and you told her to be quiet but did not remove her from the chamber under 94(a). Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been removed under 94 (a). I simply ask if you think that is fair.

Of course, it is not a tax on households; it is a charge that will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest polluters in the economy for every tonne of pollution that they produce.

Nine out of 10 households will get some combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Pensioners will benefit from an increase in the pension. Many self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that we will provide to other pensioners, part pensioners and carers. At least three million households will also get a 20 per cent buffer over and above the average price impacts of the carbon price to give them that bit of extra cash. Families, tradespeople and of course small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a fuel price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. These are very important commitments to accompany the introduction of the carbon price in our economy.

I cringe when I hear a question that finishes with: 'How has it been received and what is the government's response?' but I do have an expectation that ministers will try to relate their material directly to that aspect of the question without just going into debate willy-nilly. The minister has the call and he should recognise that point.

I will listen carefully, very carefully, to the way in which the minister relates his material directly, because that is the new standing order. Under the previous standing order, ministers from both sides of politics perfected ways of making a smidgen of relevance, but this has to be directly relevant. Therefore the preamble of the question is very important. The minister.

It is usual that one would take on face value that the member is quoting what he has been informed by the person he has named. This is a question that I have heard in its manifestation over a number of proposals put before this parliament by both sides and I indicate that I will allow the question. I am sure the Treasurer will now respond in a directly relevant manner.

Will the Minister inform the House about the consensus in the scientific community over the threat of dangerous climate change? How has this been received, and what is the government doing to address the issue?

The fact is that climate change is real and we know this because our scientific community, particularly climate scientists, have a consensus about it. An open letter from the scientific community in June of this year said:

The fact is that science underpins the quality of life that we have in Australia. In 2011-12 the Commonwealth will invest an estimated $9.4 billion in science, research and innovation through programs across the Australian government—some 43 per cent higher than the high-water mark, so called, of the Howard government. There are 55,000 researchers working in Australia's univer­sities and tens of thousands of researchers working in

He should relate his answer to the question. Obviously under the new paradigm that you have imposed today—perhaps the government did not get the memo—they cannot just go back to the old attacking the opposition answers that they have been engaged in since the election. Clearly you have made it obvious to the opposition how we should behave and therefore the minister must respond accordingly, too.

There has to be greater effort by ministers, if that is going to be used as cover.

It was this government that delivered record increases in the disability support pension and the carer payment. These have been very important increases in these pensions that help carers and people with disabilities.

                                                                                                                                                                       Just today I have introduced legislation into the parliament to help make sure that the impairment tables that help to determine access to the disability support pension are regularly updated. The last time they were updated was in 1993, so it is certainly high time that they were updated to reflect advances in medicine and rehabilitation practice. Just last Friday the Better Start for Children with Disability program started. I want to say to every member of the House just how important this program will be to the around 9,000 children we expect to benefit. For children who have cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and children born with sight or hearing difficulties, their parents will now be able to get access to financial support so that they can afford early intervention services for those children. This builds on the very successful program we have delivered over the last few years for children with autism, and we understand around 12,000 families and their children have benefited from early intervention services as a result of that initiative.

Those people will be provided with additional support as we deliver a clean energy future.

Prime Minister, have you received any represent­ations from the member for Capricornia, the member for Throsby, the member for Cunningham or the member for Hunter seeking a guarantee that no coalmine will close and that no coalminer will lose their job as a result of your carbon tax?

I believe the coal industry has a bright future in this country. The members named by the member for Paterson represent their electorates well in this parliament and they frequently raise issues with me in relation to their elect­orates—issues about jobs, health, education and meeting the assistance that families need with cost-of-living pressures. But on the coal industry they, like me, understand that this is an industry with a very bright future. It is an important part of our economy and it is an industry that has experienced very solid growth.

The spot price of coking coal is over $300 per tonne and it is around $120 per tonne for thermal coal—that is, it has doubled since 2008-09. The industry's gross value added was $22.5 billion. The near-term outlook is strong. Our experts are advising that for coal alone there is an investment pipeline of over $70 billion. Nineteen mine projects are committed or under construction and are expected to add around 60 million tonnes of additional mine capacity per year by the end of 2014, and a further 64 mine projects in the coal pipeline are awaiting approvals. So it is a strong industry with a bright future and with great employment prospects associated with it. The member has asked about the impact of carbon pricing on this industry. The best way I can respond to that is to use the words of

There are a limited number of particularly gassy mines which the government will assist as we work with the coal industry but it would be wrong, irresponsible and not in the national interest for people to try to distort the facts and claim that the coal industry does not have a bright future. It does.

This year's budget delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health reform a priority for this term of government. The budget delivers the largest mental health package ever with $2.2 billion worth of new measures delivered over five years. The government is moving quickly to roll out some of these measures.
                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                                           Last week, I was pleased to announce that mobile phone calls to Lifeline made from anywhere in Australia will now be free of charge, thanks to an agreement between the Australian government and the three major mobile carriers—delivering a key election commitment made by the government last year. Around one-third of the 450,000 calls that Lifeline receives every year are made from mobiles. The average call to Lifeline lasts around 20 minutes and obviously some of the calls from more distressed people last significantly longer. This is a significant cost to Australians in crisis who often are also suffering financially.
                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

The last thing any of us want is to be cut off in the middle of what might be a life-saving telephone convers­ation with a Lifeline counsellor. I want to place on record the government's gratitude to the three carriers and their representatives for their cooperation on this measure—not only for the technical changes which needed to be made but also for them bearing a share of forgone revenue along with the significant compensation payments the government will be making to them. This measure undoub­tedly will save lives.

Divisions are also receiving a substantial increase in their base-level funding for psychological services targeted particularly to people on low incomes and to people in rural and remote Australia. Headspace services across the country now qualify for huge increases in their core funding, allowing them to expand services like outreach to schools and to homeless youths. Having recently announced providers for 10 new services, expressions of interest will be sought over the next several months for the next tranche of 15 new headspaces.

In the agreement before the parliament, it says question time will conclude no later than 3.30, enabling 20 questions each day in the normal course of events. It is not 3.30, there have not been 20 questions and we have a member on his feet who would then make it nine questions from the opposition.

I get into trouble because, as I get told, I am too touchy but I was not in on the deal and it is not in the standing orders.

The government themselves say that this is the biggest economic change in history and yet they are waiting until after the rising of the parliament to make this so-called important announcement. They would not answer any questions during this week on the nature of this great big new tax. They wait until everybody has left Canberra so that their announcement cannot be subject to the scrutiny that parliament should be providing. This is no small tax. This will be the biggest carbon tax in the world. It will add to the cost of everything we do every day of our lives. It will make our businesses in this country less competitive. It will cost jobs. Yet the government do not think it is important enough for this to be debated and considered in the federal parliament. This tax will have an enormous impact on all Australians, but its impact in regional areas will be particularly severe because there are higher costs already in regional commun­ities. This tax will add to every single one of them. On top of that, most of the jobs that will be lost in the first round of this tax are in regional communities. So this will have a devastating impact on our nation but, in particular, it will have a devastating effect on people who live outside the capital cities.

That was an untruth. A few days ago she said she did not mean to mislead. That was another untruth. She waited until she was in the Lodge and she had the keys before she told the truth to the Australian people.
                                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

If she did not mean to mislead why did she not correct the newspaper headlines in the days that were available before the election? Why did she not ring up the television news services and say: 'You got it wrong. I did not say that at all'? What she said before the election was 'there will be no carbon tax'. There was no lack of intention to mislead. Let us make that absolutely clear.

For instance, it repeatedly says that only a thousand big polluters will pay. Everyone knows that is untrue. If you want any greater expert to make that observation, just ask Professor Garnaut or read his last climate review. This is the man who the government paid for several years to give it advice on this question—their trusted confidant—and he said, 'Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost'. Of course, that is the real truth. What the government told us about there being only a thousand payers is an untruth.

It would close the coal fired power stations. They want a much more severe tax than whatever number is announced on Sunday. That is not a scare tactic. This tax is supposed to hurt. It is designed to hurt so much that people will stop doing the things that they normally do. They will leave their car at home rather than visit their sick mother on the other side of town. They will walk to school or walk to work, or sell their house and buy a new one near their job so that they will keep their vehicle at home. They will switch off their heater on a cold Canberra morning, or they will not turn on their cooling system on a hot summer's day. This is a tax that is designed to hurt. It is designed to hurt so much that people will change their very behaviour.

I am reluctant to interrupt the Leader of the Nationals but I do want to draw to his attention the provisions of standing order 90. To accuse the Prime Minister of an untruth is skating very close to a personal reflection.

They are wrong. For instance, her statement that this tax will start small is incorrect. It is untrue. The reality is that this will be the biggest carbon tax anywhere in the world. Evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes on 9 June stated the proposed Australian carbon tax would raise more money in its first three months than the European scheme raised since it began 5½ years ago.

The Australian emis­sions trading scheme will raise more revenue in its first month than the US scheme has raised in the two years that it has been operating. It will take only one month to raise more money than the

China is only going to take about seven or eight months to increase its emissions by the amount that we have promised to reduce ours by 2015. That assumes that China actually meets its commitment to only increase its emissions by 496 per cent. The reality is that the government's statements about this are completely inaccurate.

But the Greens, who are driving this agenda, want every mine closed—every single mine closed. That will cost hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. In addition to that we have the extra costs that are going to be imposed on every business in this country, meaning they will be less competitive. There will be sectors right across the country that will have to bear bigger costs—agriculture for instance—even if Labor exempts agriculture at the first point. Professor Garnaut has made it clear that he wants agriculture in within two or three years. Australian farmers will be the only ones in the world to pay a carbon tax on the production of food for our nation.

The government have already said that only half of the money raised will be used as compensation. But no-one can compensate people for the loss of their job, for the closure of whole industries and therefore, potentially, whole towns. There will be no compensation for those people. In fact, if you are not being paid anything because you have not got a job, no compensation will make up for the higher prices they have to pay.

She promised that she would build community consensus before doing anything at all. Maybe she has not broken that promise. There is community consensus and the Australian people have made it absolutely clear that they have made up their mind and they do not want a carbon tax. The latest poll suggests over three-quarters of Australians do not want the tax. There is a community consensus and the government should listen. Call off Sunday. Do not have this big announcement. They have not achieved the consensus or, if they have, the consensus is there should be no tax at all.

The reality is that the Australian people have not been given the opportunity to have their say. The government did not tell the truth with the Australian people before the election. Now they are having a tax imposed on them that they had made absolutely clear they did not want, and they are not being consulted or given a chance to have any say.

The parliament secretary let the cat out of the bag when he said in a letter that this tax will make no difference even in 50 years' time. Professor Flannery, another one of the Labor Party's favoured sons in this particular area, went further. He said that if the whole of the world stopped emitting immediately it would not make any difference to the temperature for a thousand years. Yet this government believe that for Australia, which produces 1.4 per cent of global emissions, a tax is going to change the world. That is complete nonsense.

Sometimes it makes people get hot under the collar, but to suggest that a new tax is actually going to make our planet cooler is clearly a nonsense. If taxes made the country cooler, under a Labor government we would be frozen over from west to east. There are plenty of taxes already. The government have no mandate for a carbon tax. They have no legitimacy for government. They said they will not have a plebiscite. If you will not have a plebiscite then you must have an election to decide this issue.

Let me take the crocodile tears for a start. First of all, they said they wanted to ask questions about the impact on regional development. The shadow minister who spoke, the Leader of the National Party, is shadow minister for regional development. Not only has he not asked me a question this week in parliament about regional development, he has not asked me since we have been returned. Not only that, in the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply to the budget, there was not one mention of regional development within that speech. The regional rorts program that they presided over was an absolute disgrace and we know why. The Howard government in office was on the record as saying that it never saw a clear rationale and a constitut­ional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. So do not give us this cant and hypocrisy about your concern for regional development. Look at the history.
                                                                                                                                                                                                </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The history of this country is that it has been Labor governments that have always been the dynamic and the momentum for regional development. The Whitlam govern­ment, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Rudd government and now the Gillard government are the ones that have taken the initiative. When the Howard government came to office, they abolished the Department of Regional Development and they declared that they saw no clear constitutional rationale for that involvement. Not only is the Labor Party the best party to manage regional development; it is the party best equipped to manage the challenge of structural adjustment. There is no greater structural adjustment confronting this economy than the challenge of climate change. That is why we are facing up to it.

What we are propos­ing is the movement towards a market based mechanism which we use to adjust for the challenge of climate change. I would have thought that the party that prided itself in the principles of the market and free enterprise would have embraced this but, no, what do what we see from them? They have embraced, through direct action campaign, industry intervention and business welfare. They have embraced a mechanism that will impose on every individual in this country a $720 a year ticket to pay for those business welfare measures. And they have the gall to come into this place and talk about cost of living and impact on consumers—$720 from every man, woman and child in this country per year to pay the big polluters. We actually believe the reverse should be the case.

We believe that that tax should move to a price on carbon so that the market clears it and we believe in compensating households for that cost. This is the principle of the compensation: nine out of 10 house­holds will be compensated for the impact on them. Pensioners will get a 20 per cent supplement.

If they follow that behav­iour, they will be get a net gain from the benefit because we are compensating them to stand still but encouraging them to make the changes. If they make the changes, they will be better off. Under the Liberals, of course, with their direct action campaign, they will be worse off—$720 a year worse off.

Let us take the case of coal because there has been a lot of talk about this. In comparison to the coal production of other countries, if the market mechanism is established properly coal to coal there will be a benefit to our coal producers vis-a-vis the rest of the world. That is why we need a market mechanism that is internationally recognised. But if people move to gas, and the market mechanism prices the relativity, then there are benefits to the industry producing the gas. This is rejected by those who sit on the other side now but it was not rejected by them, including by the shadow minister who just spoke, when he sat in the Howard government's cabinet and they adopted the very same approach—a market mechanism. What they are advocating today is not what they sought to implement when they were in government. I ask the public to judge on that basis. They have done a complete backflip in terms of what they were arguing when they were in government compared to what they argue today.

Their policy, like ours, is to make an unconditional commit­ment to a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. That is correct. Both parties have that bipartisan position. The real issue here is: how do you achieve that? We are proposing an initiative—the details of which will be fully released on Sunday by us—and they are proposing their direct action campaign. Not only will their direct action campaign cost the individual $720 a year; it has been ridiculed by all the experts, including Professor Garnaut, whom the Leader of the National Party was so keen to quote in his speech recently, as well as the

Direct action is not an answer. It is costly, it costs consumers, it costs the public purse and the reason they run the fear campaign is because they do not want to talk about that and embrace it.

We are trying to adjust the patchwork nature of the economy and, when you think about it, the regions are the patches. If the argument is that we have to sustain the economy beyond the resources boom, which is the economy in transition, which our budget underpinned, it is essential that we get local input and local engagement from the patches and embrace that transitory nature that challenges us. So we are an economy in transition. The regions need to respond and they need to respond in a way that also factors in the impact of the climate change debate. We are better placed than any country in the world for two reasons. First of all, we are the only developed country in the world to have avoided going into recession during the global financial crisis meltdown—there are a number of reasons for that, which I do not have time to go into here—and we are the envy of the rest of the world. Every time I have attended international confere­nces, countries have come up to me and said, 'How did you do it? How did you avoid it?' The second point that is in our favour is that we engaged, because of previous policies by both governments, but initiated by the Hawke and Keating government, with Asia at a time when it was not popular to do so. We engaged with Asia, which is now the fastest growing region in the world. Not only have we avoided the recession, not only have we got this engagement with Asia, that is what is continuing to fuel our resources boom. But the resources boom will not last forever and that is why we need to position ourselves and ensure that the economy diversifies. The best way to get that diversification is to engage the regions and that is why the policy prescription that we have set down, including in the budget, is all about doing that.

We are seeking to take advantage of the market mechanism we are working to estab­lish to better position ourselves to make that transition. Cleaner coal, gas and renewables are all commitments that we are making. But it is not just us arguing that; the regions themselves are embracing this. I say to the member who has already spoken in this debate and to those who follow him: when they talk about the threat to regional Australia, they should get out properly in the regions instead of spreading their fear campaign and ask the regions how they are facing up to this challenge.

Some examples of that are developing a renewable energy strategy in far west

We know how well negative arguments can work. We have practised them before. But in the end, truth comes to bear. In this case what we are seeing is the opportunity out there. The regions understand not just the threat those on the other side would have us believe is going to come from our initiative but they see opportunity. That is where we should be challenging regional Australia, not scaring them. We should actually be encouraging them to grasp the opportunity, take the initiative, seize the moment and diversify their economic base. All of the regions should be tasked with this initiative by us saying, 'You identify how you want your patch to work better.' The vast bulk of the regions are embracing the renewable energy strategy, the green jobs strategy and the challenge of climate change.

They should support their regions in grasping the opportunity. They should stop the fear campaign. By the way, once the full details are out on Sunday, they will be looking like very hollow people indeed. The fear campaign can only work for a certain distance. The truth of the matter is that the detail out there, the compensation measures, the industry support measures, the commit­ment to actually leading on this, the understanding of our intrinsic strength, the understanding that we do need to diversify the economic base and actually prepare the regions and support them in doing it, will win through. In the end, as I said at the beginning, the only party that has ever had this commitment to regional development is Labor. Labor will again do it and we will also ensure that the structural adjustment is done in such a way that people are helped to make the adjustment, not be threatened by it.

The cost of paying these bills and doing the weekly shopping has become so much higher under this Gillard government. Why does the Labor govern­ment want to make everything so much more expensive? Why do they want to make things even more expensive with a carbon tax? It is because the Prime Minister is beholden to the radical agenda of the Greens.

This carbon tax is one of those poorly thought out, fringe party policies that seeks to please the few by harming the majority. It is an embarrassment for this Prime Minister and the Labor Party that not only has a carbon tax become the policy of a major political party, it has become the centrepiece of their government.

As we are a motel, our guests often do not really care how much power they are consuming, as they do not pay the bill. We have increased our room tariffs, however, looking at this year's financial figures to date our operating costs have increased more than we have been able to recoup through price increases. What worries me is that particularly being in a regional area, it is difficult to keep increasing rates, as people are only prepared to pay so much. I fear the uncertainty of this proposed tax, and worry that it could spell the end of many small businesses, who will find it difficult to pass on the increases, and simply do not have the capital to invest in alternative power solutions.

He believes the carbon tax will put up prices by at least five per cent because that is what he thinks it will increase the cost base of his business by.

What this government does not seem to understand is that the tyranny of distance means that Labor's carbon tax will hit the kitchen tables in regional Australia so much harder. Goods are transported by trucks everywhere across Australia. Everything we use and everything we consume is transported by trucks. This government's decision to put a tax on the diesel used by heavy trucks will drive up prices—and they are going to be so proud of that!

Between 2000 and 2008, the cost of electricity in Australia rose by 55.9 per cent. Over that same period, consumption rose by 10 per cent—from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So where is the link between pushing up the price of electricity and reducing consumption? It is not there. These are statistics; these are not lies or inferences. You cannot cut back on the essentials of life and this insidious Labor tax grab will not reduce emissions one iota. It will only reduce affordability for people living in regional Australia.

Businesses have warned them and the unions have warned them, but they are too frightened to admit it. One day, however, they are going to have to front their electorates and explain why jobs have gone. They will have to answer the questions that their electorates will ask them about the electricity price hikes, the food price hikes and the grocery price hikes. The whole point of the carbon tax—and let us be very clear about this—is to drive up prices to reduce consumption.

Do you know what? The Treasurer would not answer the question. She asked about the increased cost of electricity because electricity is a major cost for a dairy farmer—in refrig­eration and in operating their dairy facilities. The only thing I can see happening with this carbon tax, in regional Australia in particular, is jobs being driven away from our region.

The member for Capricornia has 2,000 coalminers in her electorate to explain to, the members for Corangamite and Corio have 1,300 car workers to explain to, the member for Hunter has 2,700 coal workers to explain to, the members for Throsby and Cunning­ham have 2,000 coal workers to explain to, the member for Throsby has a further 5,300 steelworkers to explain to, the member for Wakefield has 2,700 car workers to explain to, the member for Lingiari has 850 aluminium workers to explain to and the member for Bass has 560 aluminium workers to explain to. Those 17,410 workers in regional Australia do not have a voice on the Labor side. They are taken for granted.

The difference is that the government wants to penalise and tax and shift money around.

As I said earlier, if increasing the price of electricity was going to change habits then we would not have seen a 10 per cent increase in consumption per capita while electricity prices rose by 55 per cent in that same period. It was the former Prime Minister in 2009 who said, 'Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time'. I put it to you, Mr Deputy

To address the greatest moral challenge we now face, it is very clear what should be done. This Prime Minister, if she had an ounce of integrity or honesty, would go to the polls and seek a mandate. This Prime Minister has not listened to the people, because if she had listened to the people she would have heard very clearly that they do not want a carbon tax. People in the gallery: do you want a carbon tax? Do you want to be penalised? These are the questions that need to be answered, because the Prime Minister will not get out there and talk to people like you.

He refuses to listen to people—like all Labor members, it is all tell and no listen. What you have to do, if you want to embark on the process, is take people on the journey with you, and they have not done that.

The only problem is that those opposite have no plan that will enable our country to reach that target. The only thing they have put forward is a plan which will cost billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Under their plan, Australia will not reach that emissions reduction target or anything like it by 2020. If we proceed down the path that the coalition is proceeding on, it will commit Australia to purchasing international permits at a cost of billions and billions of dollars to the taxpayers of this country.

He asserts that the members of those electorates should explain their position on action on climate change or action on pricing carbon to the people of their electorates. I would call on all members opposite to explain to the constituents in their electorates why they have adopted no effective policy on climate change and why they have embarked on a script—and they have all got a script; we heard it today from the Leader of the Nationals and from the member for Paterson—which is basically about instilling fear in the people of Australia and deceiving the people of Australia. Those opposite have been engaging in dumb stunts all over the country, and in no sense have they been engaging in the kind of debate that we need to be having.

The Howard government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition was part of the cabinet—he has got a bit of explaining to do—adopted an emissions trading scheme as the policy of the coalition before the 2007 election. Until four days before the second time on which the

Of course, the reason is that we on this side of the House care about the future of our children. We care about the future of our children's children. We care about the future of the planet. We know the best target that we can now get to is the stabilisation of world temperatures at around two degrees by 2050 and, to do so, we have to immediately start cutting global emissions, which includes cutting Australia's emissions.

Of course it is the case that rural and regional Australia will be hit at least as hard, if not harder, as any other part of Australia by climate change. In particular, farming activities and other agricultural activities across our country are going to be hit by dangerous climate change. People in rural and regional Australia understand that only too well, because in many rural areas of Australia they are already experiencing the effects of dangerous climate change. That is why our government is embarking on a carbon price mechanism for Australia, the details of which are going to be announced this Sunday by the Prime Minister.

They were doing what the coalition has been doing for at least the past four months, which is going around and making stuff up—in other words, just invent­ing details about our carbon price scheme before any announcement of its detail. This is part of their scare campaign and misleading of the Australian people. Indeed, it would include attacking anyone who does not agree with what the Leader of the Opposition or members of the coalition might say. We have had month after month of this scare campaign by the opposition and month after month of them making stuff up. The recent attack that the Leader of the Opposition made on economists was someth­ing to behold. It is hard to believe that any responsible national leader in our country could have made the kinds of comments that the Leader of the Opposition made last Friday about economists. But you can perhaps understand why the Leader of the Opposition made the comments if you take a single example. A group of exceptionally eminent economists wrote an open letter on 2 June this year explaining their view about putting a price on carbon pollution. I will read one of their key conclusions and then explain who they are. They said:

This is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 1 July: 'It may well be that most Australian economists think that a carbon tax is the way to go. Maybe that is a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of the argument.' What a cheap shot! What a disgraceful thing to say! But it is typical of the Leader of the Opposition, who, whenever anybody does not agree with him or the coalition's supposed policies, thinks that the appropriate response is simply to attack them personally.

That was the present Leader of the Opposition. What hypocrisy! The Leader of the Opposition never does anything other than carefully choreograph photo opportunities. All we have had for the last four months, since the Prime Minister's announcement of the broad framework of the scheme, is such carefully choreographed photo opportunities. He refuses to be interviewed, refuses to do anything other than hand out slogans.

We have had months of them talking down the Australian economy, talking down our skills. We are a clever, creative nation, and it is about time those opposite recognised that and assisted us in designing an appropriate carbon price for Australia.

What was it on? It was on tax. What was the tax? A GST. How many seats did the government of the day lose during the tax debate? Nineteen seats. I am saying to the backbench of the Labor Party right now: there is a huge issue. The leaders in your party got you into this mess. Have a look at the percentages by which most of your leadership, except for your Treasurer, hold their seats and ask whether they will be here after the next election. The answer is: yes, they will be here. Will you be here? No, you will not be here. Not just on the current trends—I am talking about when you are arguing to us about a major scare campaign on a tax, having been in that place where you are today, holding your seat, wondering whether you are going to make it, wondering whether you are going to have a wage into the future. It has been hard to get there; it is hard to hold. I am talking to every member of your backbench in this government now, and those that have been around for a while know exactly what I am talking about here. You have one way out of this.

What they did discover was that there is no country in the whole world that is going to introduce a tax like this—not one country in the whole world: read the Productivity Commission report. It was not a positive report for the tax. It did not put Australia in a good light. It did not say that we should be leading the world. It did not say that we should be putting our workers at disadvantage; we should not be trading green jobs overseas. The member for Hunter knows exactly what I am talking about. There will be green jobs, all right. Do you know where they will be? They will be in China, India and Indonesia. They will not be here for our workers. Is that understood? There will be green jobs. Perhaps the truck drivers across the nation now are hearing this: you will not be carting the stuff that you are carting today, because it will be carted around in China, where the pollution will be greater than in this country.

But I will come back and say to those members of parliament who are sitting in this place today, who have a desire for the betterment of the nation, who are concerned about their kids, who are concerned about their future, whose husbands would like to have a job, whose wives would like to have a job, whose kids want a job, whose partners want a job, that we have a nation led by a leader that says, 'I am prepared to trade off those jobs and those opportunities in this country and trade them into another country,' for heaven's sake. I thought the first responsibility of a Prime Minister of this nation was for the health and wellbeing of its people, its economy and its defence.

You know that you are completely shackled to this Prime Minister through this carbon tax, about which she has already deceived the Australian people for base political reasons in the middle of an election campaign by saying: 'I am not going to have this tax. Do not worry anybody; we are not going to have a tax.' That is what she was really saying. She was told to by her minders to say, 'We can't have a tax.'

While the member for McMillan takes some comfort in the fact that his losses were never his fault, what we need to be doing in this place is putting the national interest ahead of our own interests. That is exactly what the government is doing with the introduction of this very important public policy reform.

What it is not is a debate about the science of climate change. The Leader of the Opposition and members on the other side generally have accepted that we must tackle climate change and that human beings make a contribution to the warming of the planet. That is why the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit opposite have their own policy. Indeed, as the member for Paterson reminded us, they have the same targets on carbon reduction as the government. This is really only a debate about the relative policies of the major parties—what we intend to do and what they intend to do in response to this pressing environmental challenge.

Have a think about that in economic terms. This represents a big economic distortion. Small businesses who generate waste have to take their waste to the dump—they pay. Large chemical businesses have an expensive process for disposing of their waste, and they pay. You and I, Mr Deputy

People ask me why we are charging the polluters and compensating them, the people, as consum­ers. Unfortunately businesses, where they can, will pass some of those additional and new business costs onto consumers, and we will protect those consumers. We are not so much seeking to change the behaviour of consumers, considerable merit though that may have; we are trying to change the habits, first, of investors who with a level playing field after the introduction of an

They are going to tax people more, hand that money to the polluters and say, 'We are going to help you introduce those new technologies; we will help you get your emissions down.' There are no guarantees; no contracts—they will hand all that money over to the big polluters in the hope they will do the right thing and invest in technologies and reduce their carbon emissions. Let there be no mistake: this is not a debate about the science of climate change; it is not a debate about whether we should do something about climate change—it is only a debate about how we address climate change in this country.

What do those opposite think the Productivity Commission was looking at? What do they think the Productivity Commission would have been studying in those countries if those countries had not taken action on climate change? Of course they have taken action, and they are taking very substantial action. Australia is being left behind.

Here we are, still debating it mid-2011, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time, most members on the other side—including I think the Leader of the Opposition but certainly the former Leader of the Opposition and the former former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Nelson—supported Mr Howard's policy.

That is absolute rubbish. Even the coal industry's own modelling did not show a loss of jobs in the coalmining industry, as some people have suggested. It did suggest—I am not saying I agree with it, because modelling is modelling as we all know—that there would be potentially a growth in jobs if this system were introduced. So let us not have these misrepresentations. I am certainly not concerned about job losses in coalmining in my electorate. I can assure you, thanks to heavy demand in Asia for our resources, that jobs in coalmining in my electorate will continue to grow—and the investment pipeline is already in place. The third myth is that the sky will fall. The sky did not fall in New Zealand, the sky did not fall in California and the sky has not fallen anywhere where carbon abatement has become a serious government policy. The member for Paterson predictably spent a little bit of time zeroing in on my electorate and Hunter region more generally. It just goes to show how totally out of touch he is with community sentiment in the

We have huge land use conflicts. People are saying in increasing numbers that they want to ensure that the coalmining industry—as important as it has been to us but which will maybe last for 30 years—does not impact on sustainable industries such as agriculture, thoroughbred breeding and viticulture. These are industries that have supported us and provided us with an income for many decades and will hopefully sustain us into the next century and beyond.

People working in coalmines in my elect­orate are not fearful that the ETS is going to cost them their job. They have not been fooled by the scare campaign of the opposition, as much as I hate to disappoint the member for McMillan. They want bal­ance and through the minerals resource rent tax they want to get their fair share of the product that comes out of the ground locally. They want to ensure that the environment is protected and that the true cost of the coalmines is reflected in government policy, and that those sustainable industries are not destroyed by the coalmining industry. There is a balance there.

It is exactly why we acted to avert a recession at home.

And despite the fact that we have been hit hard by natural disasters, we continue to have one of the most enviable economic scorecards of the developed world. We are not immune from global uncertainty—and this is clearly reflected in some of the patchy economic conditions we are experiencing at home. But it does not change the fact that we face a dramatically different set of challenges to many of our peers. As I have said before, our challenges are far better challenges to have.

In recent weeks these risks have become more pronounced and the global recovery has weakened. We have seen a hit to the Japanese economy from the earth­quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster as well as disruption to international supply chains. In the United States, a depressed labour market, unprecedented weakness in the housing market and high oil prices are still holding back recovery.

However, given their status as euro area members, the potential for contagion is significant, particularly in the event of a disorderly default. With banks in Europe and the US holding significant amounts of European government debt, such contagion could generate renewed financial market turmoil globally.

Moody’s pointed to a growing risk that Portugal would also need further financial support and that it may be unable to meet its deficit reduction targets.

These issues also go to the heart of the work I am doing with my G20 colleagues to bring about strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.

This strong growth in Asia is helping to accelerate the transformation that was already underway in the global economy before the crisis hit.

But there will be just as pronounced an impact on the rest of our economy in future as the growth in Asia’s middle class drives demand for the rest of our goods and services.

The fact is, we are only in a position to capitalise on these opportunities because of our strong economic foundations.

While many of our peers are still struggling to make up for lost ground, Australia’s GDP is now significantly ahead of what it was at the start of the crisis.

While our unemployment rate stands at just 4.9 per cent, economies like the US and euro area are grappling with unemployment rates in excess of nine per cent.

Net government debt is expected to peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 and decline thereafter. Even at its peak, Australia’s net debt will be less than one tenth of the average of the major advanced economies.

Consumers are still more cautious than they have been in the period before the crisis—spending less and saving a bit more. This is not surprising given the subdued recovery in household wealth since the global financial crisis and the uncertainty surrounding the global outlook. Credit conditions also remain tight.

And the historic shift in the global gravity from East to West is taking our terms of trade to record heights, and is driving an unprecedented pipeline of business investment—with ABARES estim­ating a pipeline of $430 billion in resources alone.

Local banks now depend less on wholesale funding from abroad than during the global financial crisis because they are attracting more local deposits. Their foreign currency denominated funding rem­ains fully hedged into Australian dollars.

But it is important that we build on our existing regulatory framework to ensure that we maintain a world-class, efficient and safe financial sector.

The government is also taking action through its competitive and sustainable banking system reforms to help consumers get a better deal, while also securing the long-term safety and sustainability of our financial system. This government is clearly focused on the challenges facing the global economy and what this means for us.

This means serious economic reforms like putting in place a price on carbon to drive investment in the clean-energy technologies of the future. It means continuing our record of serious tax reform, where we are introducing a broad range of reforms, like the minerals resource rent tax and a cut to the company tax rate.

Surely, of all the issues that the Treasurer could discuss, the detail on the carbon tax would be of the most immediate interest to the House and the Australian people. What the Treas­urer has done is to outline some of the risks as to the international outlook. In particular, he has noted concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and the challenge of addressing fiscal sustainability in Europe, Japan and the USA. The coalition shares these concerns.

The Treasurer does not seem to realise that it is the continued uncertainty and risks in the international environment which make it critically important that Australia gets its fiscal house in order. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that federal government debt itself represents a risk, and that the debt should be paid down as soon as possible, not at some uncertain date at the decade's end. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that maintaining a stable and certain policy envir­onment for investors is critically important to preserving confidence and investment, part­icularly at a time when sovereign risk is high in the list of concerns for the international community about Australia.

Well, I think he is tiptoeing around the true state of our economy. This country should be going at full speed ahead, with the terms of trade at 140-year highs delivering an unprecedented boost to nat­ional income. But we now find that consumers and businesses are increasingly uncertain and lack confidence. Recent economic indicators show that the Australian economy is going throng a soft patch. Let me run through the evidence. Consumer confidence was down 2.6 per cent in June, to the lowest level since June 2009. Retail spending was down 0.6 per cent in May. In trend terms, Australian turnover for retail in May was only 2.4 per cent higher than in May 2010, which is a very weak increase in the space of a year. Investment in dwellings is collapsing. Dwelling construction approv­als were down 7.9 per cent in May and in trend terms have fallen for seven consecutive months. House prices are down, with industry data showing capital city values falling in the five months to May. Demand for credit is weak, with household borrowing for housing rising at the slowest pace in a generation. And this household caution has led to consumers cocooning, with the house­hold savings ratio rising to 11.5 per cent in the March quarter to around the highs of the financial crisis a few years ago. So it is no surprise this is reflecting in a softening in business conditions, with the

Perhaps he wants us to believe that this loss of confidence is linked to concerns on the international front. I note Australia has been through bouts of international uncertainty before. Australia sailed through the Asian crisis of 1998, in spite of concerns in some quarters that our close ties with Asia would lead to severe repercussions for our economy, and I well recall the Australian dollar falling to near-record lows at that time. Australia was relatively unaffected by the near-recession in the developed world in 2001 in the face of significant headwinds. And we were arguably the developed country least affected by the

There are many, many elements to this. Taxation policy is just one. The govern­ment's approach to taxation reform is to milk the economy for all it can get. The government has introduced, increased or foreshadowed 19 taxes since it came to power just over three years ago. From 1 July this year—just five days ago—workers are now paying the flood levy. That is an extra half of one per cent in increased personal income taxes for people with an income between $50,000 and $100,000, so up to $250 a year, and one per cent for incomes above that. Households now have a little less spending power than they had a week ago. That is unlikely to make them more confident about the future, especially whilst they are facing massive increases in elect­ricity prices, water prices and transport prices. The government's behaviour in refusing to release the details of the carbon tax while parliament is sitting, to allow proper scrutiny, is not helping confidence. Australians have many legitimate questions about this tax. The coalition has been asking these questions for months and, especially, this week. But the government just refuses to answer. This refusal to answer has left many thousands of households and businesses in limbo. Will the carbon tax apply to diesel for the trucks and other vehicles run by small businesses? The government announced an initiative in relation to petrol but then it did not want to explain who it would apply to and who it did not apply to.

The government has announced part of the compensation equation but it will not tell anyone about the rest of the equation. What will be the price per tonne of carbon? We have had members of the committee responsible for shaping the carbon tax speculating about a price of up to $100 a tonne. In some cases it is settling on $40 a tonne, yet this just creates further uncertainty. How quickly will this tax rise? Again, an unknown issue that has not been addressed yet.

We know from the information that has been selective­ly leaked to the media that the carbon committee has thrashed out the details. Although, we do know that not all the members of cabinet have seen the details of the carbon tax. The entry of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the chamber is very timely because I understand he will not see the details of the carbon tax until Friday or Saturday. It is the case that the Independents and the Greens know more about the carbon tax package than those government members who are members of cabinet, and who are meant to approve it. It shows how totally dysfunctional the decision making is in this government.

That is a natural response when the economic future becomes uncertain. Aust­ralians have understandably lost confidence in the quality of the economic management of this government. Australia has never before had a government that is so cavalier with taxpayers' money, spending billions of dollars to install pink batts and millions more to inspect them and remove them. School halls and other school buildings were built well above the normal price that should be paid in the private sector. Computers in schools are another cracker;

I would warn her to get her facts right. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government claims to be a responsible economic manager even while it is running huge budget deficits at a time when we are experiencing the best terms of trade in 140 years. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government continues to compete for funds in the capital markets and puts upward pressure on interest rates at a time when households and businesses are already struggling with the impact of seven recent increases in less than two years.

We have a Prime Minister who says one thing before an election and then does the opposite after the election. This government is failing in its long term planning to provide the future underpinnings for the economy. Sir

We need a government that will restore the trust and confidence of Australians and restore Austr­alia as an attractive place to do business. What this country now needs is a coalition government.

I wish to update the House on the future directions of Australia’s aid program. As members will be aware, in November 2010 the government commissioned an indepen­dent review of aid effectiveness. This was the first independent review of Australia's aid program since 1996. It was time to take a comprehensive look at the management and quality of our aid and to give direction to the future of our aid program. The panel submitted its report to me at the end of April. Today, in releasing the report, I wish to advise the House on the outcomes of the review and to outline the government’s response to the recommendations contained in it.

The panel received around 300 public submissions from a wide cross-section of the Australian and international community. I take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record my appreciation to the members of the panel for the dedicated and professional approach they brought to this task. They delivered the report on time and on budget.

We have, for instance, consolidated our projects and programs around internationally agreed development goals—education, health and food security. While the aid program has increased by almost two-thirds since 2006-07, this has not resulted in an increase in the number of individual aid programs. Indeed, since 2007, the number of aid programs managed by the government fell from 1,884 to 1,349. This has meant less time spent on administering small programs, and more resources devoted to building effective long-term partnerships and delivering better results for the poor.

It found that the program is capable of improvement and that many of these improvements are already well underway. The review makes 39 recom­mendations to improve the aid program. The review highlighted that Australia continues to be recognised internationally for the important leadership role it plays in the Asia-Pacific region on development matters. It noted our strong record in areas such as disability-inclusive development, perform­ance management and transparency. The review found that fraud in the aid program was very, very low and that AusAID has strong systems for fraud detection and prevention. It also found that AusAID is well led and that its staff are generally highly motivated and capable.

The recommendations of the aid effectiveness review will help us deliver that. They deal with the purpose of our aid program, the effectiveness of our aid program, the type of aid program we deliver, where we will deliver our aid and how we deliver that aid. The cornerstone, however, of this entire reform is the maximisation of aid effectiveness.

This also serves Australia's national interests by promoting stability and prosperity both in our region and beyond. We focus our effort in areas where Australia can make a difference and where our resources can most effectively and efficiently be deployed.

We believe the right thing to do is to help our fellow human beings out of poverty, because as Australians it is not in our nature to be indifferent to the sufferings of others. Our belief in a fair go does not stop at the Australian continental shelf. Our aid program is therefore a product of our own values. But we are also hard-nosed enough to know that we do so in a manner which supports our nation’s interests. We want to build stability in our region, because that enhances the security of us all. The aid program helps to uphold this system of global cooperation, and that is critical for us all. We therefore want to make sure that we are enhancing our overall position within the region. What we therefore have as both an expression of our values and our interests is an expression of good international citizenship. Increasing our assistance will enhance Australia’s international reputation and influence in global and regional affairs. Australia has a strong interest in enhancing a global and regional system that promotes cooperation and partnership between countries.

The aid program helps to uphold this system of global cooperation. We want to sustain and enhance an international system that deals with global changes in an orderly manner through global agencies that deal with economic development, that deal with natural disasters and that deal with humanitarian conflict. The alternative would be absolute chaos: every person, every country, simply fending for themselves through a beggar-thy-neighbour approach. The massive, destabilising dispersals of peoples from one point of the world to another, of the type we have seen throughout much of world history, would continue on a grander scale than ever before and with potentially disastrous consequences for us all. We therefore have a deep national interest, and we have deep national values at stake, in building a global rules-based order that deals with poverty, that deals with humanitarian issues and that deals with human rights.

We have already made a good start on this by reducing the number of technical advisers by 25 per cent over the next two years and further reducing unreasonable remuneration levels for ongoing advisers so we get maximum return on the aid dollar. We must also maintain what the aid effectiveness review describes as the 'serious and systematic approach within AusAID to fraud management'. AusAID maintains zero tolerance towards any fraud in the aid program and this assists us to minimise fraud, by any credible global standard. For example, in 2010-11 the estimated potential loss due to fraud was 0.021 per cent of AusAID's appropriated funds—I repeat: 0.021 per cent. In other words: that is 21c for every $1,000 spent. This is a much lower rate of loss than that recorded by most other government agencies, private sector compan­ies and other aid donors. This has been a strong achievement by AusAID, given so many of the countries in which Australian aid operates have weak probity systems and rate poorly on most international corruption indicators.

In addition to fraud management, AusAID has a four-point perf­ormance management system which deals with any quality challenges with the program as they arise. This involves AusAID’s own internal quality-reporting system, the Office of Development Effectiveness, the Aust­ralian National Audit Office and the OECD Development Assistance Committee peer review system. The strength of these systems was endorsed, for example, in the 2009

Moreover, AusAID will prov­ide a ratings system for all of its international development partners in order to ensure that we maximise the use of those agencies which rate highest. We will establish a new Transparency Charter in order to provide more accessible information on what we fund and the results we achieve. We will use this to encourage debate and contestability and, in turn, improve our effectiveness. The Transparency Charter will record where pro­grams are going well and, where programs may not be going well, it will record that as well—the whole point being to be open and accountable to the Australian public about how their aid dollar is being spent.

In the past this was not the case as AusAID-delivered funds were treated separ­ately within the process of government to aid funds delivered by other government depart­ments. This will now change. We will review annually our progress against the results in the four-year budget strategy. We will undertake a substantive external review of the entire program every five years. We will act quickly and decisively where we find that aid programs are not delivering. Non-performing programs will be abolished and, for those in need of reform, reform will be delivered. And we will enhance further the capacity of AusAID, the government’s lead agency in the fight against global poverty, to manage an increasing aid budget effectively.

It is the region which we believe we can be most effective in. It is the region where two-thirds of the world’s poverty currently lies. It is the region where the rest of the world often expects Australia to provide leadership. And it is the region of the world where our most direct, strategic and economic interests lie. It is for these reasons that the Asia-Pacific occupies in 2011-12 nearly 75 per cent of Australia’s bilateral aid. For the purposes of the debate, I emphasise to the House that back in 2004-05 the Asia-Pacific represented, I think, only 67 per cent of the total aid program administered by the Australian government.

This will continue into the future. In Indonesia, around 30 million Indonesians live on less than $1.25 a day and more than 100 million live on $2 a day or less. Many poor Indonesians do not have access to basic food, education or health services. In line with the findings of the review, Australia will increase its aid to Indonesia and more aid will be directed at key sectors where Australia is having the greatest impact.

The government has agreed, or agreed in-prin­ciple, to 38 of these recommendations put forward by the review and noted one concerning the formal description of the portfolio, as this forms part of considerations of future administrative arrangements.

Today I have outlined the govern­ment’s commitment to a larger and more effective aid program. The government’s efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the aid program, including its response to the independent review, represent some of the most far-reaching changes to the aid program in more than a decade.

It was former coalition policy, prior to the last election, that there be an independent inquiry into our aid budget. It was not the policy of the Labor Party at the last election to conduct such a review. To his credit, the Minister for Foreign Affairs adopted our policy and this independent review was conducted.

Millions extra was paid to various firms to promote AusAID's global agenda, including $185,866 to sell Austr­alia's aid message in Africa. Some $330,000 was paid for a one-month communications research project and $12.8 million was awarded for the redevelopment of just one school in Nauru. Each one of these initiatives may well have been worth while. Each one of these initiatives may well have been justifiable. But these were the kinds of reports that attracted public attention and public concern, and a vigorous debate in the community ensued.

Some of this information has come from questions in writing that I have asked in this parliament. These questions have been part of the increased scrutiny under which our aid program finds itself. Scrutiny is vital because of the large sums of taxpayer dollars at stake.

Why do we have a foreign aid program? Why are Australian taxpayer dollars spent to help people in developing countries? What is the purpose and worth of our foreign aid program? The simple answer is that we do it because it is a moral obligation of developed countries to assist developing countries. We support them because our funds can reduce infant mortality, reduce maternal mortality, provide clean water, support economic development and foster more stable and prosperous societies. This support is not provided purely because we should assist those worse off than ourselves; it is also firmly in our national interest. Foreign aid should be directed to encouraging self-sufficiency in recipient countries and not welfare depend­ency. It is interesting to look back at recent history of foreign aid programs around the world. Foreign aid grew exponentially in the wake of

It is important that we support the development of these countries in terms of compassion and human development but also to try and prevent the collapse of governments and societies. Failed nations are far more costly to stabilise and rebuild than investment through foreign aid which can provide stability.

The 39 recommendations are well worth considering in detail. I partic­ularly welcome the recommendations relat­ing to greater levels of accountability and transparency. There has been a culture of nondisclosure around the delivery of Australia's aid program for too long, and it is vital that accountability is at the highest level. Arguably the most important recomm­endation is the final one, recommendation 39, which refers to, in effect, performance benchmarks. The report states:

Australians are a generous people and give private donations to many worthy causes in developing countries around the world. However, they do want confidence that their private donations and their taxpayer funds provided to the govern­ment for aid are actually being spent to alleviate poverty and to help countries to develop self-sufficiency. The ultimate goal must be to build that self-reliance, of course, and not to entrench reliance or develop a welfare mentality.

The recomm­endation that aid increases be higher to nations with higher standards of governance is also sensible and will help reduce corruption and waste within the program. There must be a zero-tolerance approach not only to fraud and corruption but also to waste and mismanagement in the aid program.

We should resist the temptation to spread our aid budget too thinly, particularly if it is in the pursuit of political or other goals.

In 2006, the Howard government established the Office of Development Effectiveness to monitor and assess the quality and impact of our aid spending. The steering committee set up to oversee the office included represent­atives from the departments of the Prime Minister and cabinet, Treasury and finance. This initiative was flagged by the government in its 2006 white paper on Australia's overseas aid program. The Office of Development Effectiveness was given responsibility for publishing an annual review of development effectiveness, acting as a resource for government agencies involved in Office of Development Effectiveness eligible expenditure, evaluat­ing the implementation of country strategies and policies and publicising the results, undertaking reviews and periodic spot checks, and supporting the application of sound management principles. Other work undertaken by the Office of Development Effectiveness in those early years included country assessments of Indonesia and the Philippines. I note that the report of the independent review of aid effectiveness referred to the Office of Development Effectiveness in these terms:

It would be responsible for undertaking and publishing each year a manageable number (say, 10–20) of high quality evaluations. The Office would also publish an annual synthesis of evaluations and a quality assurance assessment of the aid program’s performance management system.

All draft independent evaluations and the new annual synthesis report would be discussed and then cleared by the Independent Evaluation Committee (not AusAID) and then published.

The coalition will continue to scrutinise the aid budget. We will consider this report in detail and we will closely monitor the government's response. In particular we will hold the government to account over its implementation of the recommendations and the development of performance benchmarks. The coalition will continue to develop our priorities for the foreign aid budget. We will no doubt use the recommendations contained in this report released today to influence and inform our deliberations.

The size of our aid budget and the forecast increases mean that we must use all tools at our disposal to ensure accountability and transparency. The Aust­ralian public deserve and demand no less.

It further noted that the CDPP had not relied on any notice issued to the defendant to establish a duty to inform the department of an event or change of circumstances, and that the administration act did 'not create a separate "stand alone" obligation'. On this basis, the court set aside the convictions which had been recorded against the defendant.

Without a detailed analysis of each case, it is not possible to state definitively how many matters of social security fraud have been committed via omission since the introduc­tion of the Criminal Code. However, the government's best estimate is that as many as 40 per cent of this number, or around 15,000 convictions, may now be open to question as a consequence of the decision in Poniat­owska. To ensure the past convictions cannot be called into question, this bill amends the administration act to insert a stand-alone obligation for a person to inform the department of events or changes of circum­stances that might affect the payment of a social security payment to the person or the person's qualification for a concession card.

However, in this case there are exceptional circumstances justifying retrospectivity, namely that it would not be appropriate for a significant number of prosecutions condu­cted from 2000 for social security fraud to be overturned on the basis of previously unidentified legal technicalities.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        One of the criticisms that can be directed at retrospective legislation in relation to criminal offences is that people will be unaware that their conduct is an offence. In this case, however, the convicted persons would all have been aware that they should have informed the department of the specified events and changes of circumst­ances listed in the notices given to them by Centrelink in relation to their social security payment or concession card. The effect of the retrospective application of this provision is to confirm convictions already made.

Its operations depend on the use of computer programs to generate decisions based on the requirements of the social security legis­lation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

These notices require that the person inform the department of events or changes of circum­stances which might affect the person's social security payment or qualification for a concession card. This will not change as a result of this bill.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

It has been brought forward by the government, based on advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General, to address technical issues that have been brought to light by recent litigation. It does so without disturbing the existing protections that the law guarantees for Centrelink clients.

When people find themselves in necessitous circumstances whether by way of unemployment or disability, or some other affliction in their lives, then the commitment of the Australian people shared across the aisle of politics is that we provide them with welfare. That has been done for many decades in Australia and, by any internat­ional standards, the provision of that welfare in this country is most generous.

It comes from the taxes which are contributed by other Australians to ensuring the common good of all people in this country. I say that because there is a concomitant responsibility or duty on the part of people who are in receipt of welfare, and part of that duty is to be truthful and frank about their financial circumstances. If, for example, a person's financial circum­stances change and they are in receipt of more income than they were at the time that they received their welfare or they become the owner of some asset, they have the responsibility to inform the social security authorities through Centrelink of those changed circumstances so that a reassess­ment of their situation can be made consistent with providing welfare to them and consistent with the broader objective of meeting the common good of all Australians.

This is something which is commonly understood and known throughout the Australian population. Indeed, if a person was unaware of that and they are in receipt of welfare, they are regularly reminded of that comm­itment, that obligation, in letters that they receive in regard to their particular payment from the government.

Defrauding the Commonwealth might sound like the defrauding of some remote institution, but the reality is that defrauding the Commonwealth is defrauding all Austra­lians, because all Australians who are taxpayers make contributions to the funds which enable these payments of welfare to be made.

Indeed, if that was the last say on that case in those particular circumstances, the prosecution would have been overturned. The minister said that this is a matter currently before the High Court and we are waiting for the High Court to pass judgment.

That is a principle which I think in most cases we would subscribe to, because until the High Court does hand down that judgment there is still some uncertainty or some final determination to be made by the judicial officers of this land. However, the danger in this case is that, if we do wait, there are potentially thousands of cases that could be overturned, and not only overturned by people seeking to quash those convictions but potentially compen­sation claims made against the Common­wealth.

Nobody in a legislative mode approaches retrospectivity lightly. As a general proposition, we do not wish to say that something which was regarded as lawful in the past is now unlawful and to go back to those past events. It is one thing to do it prospectively but it is another thing entirely to do it retrospectively. So it is appropriate that concerns about retrospectivity be raised in relation to this case. However, there is a difference here. We are not creating an offence anew. People have been charged with offences and they have been convicted of welfare fraud. Nobody will be affected or captured by this legislation who had not already been caught and penalised before. In fact, if the legislation does not pass and the High Court upholds the majority finding in the

Whilst one may argue about the technic­alities of the law, this is a case where we ought to go back to what the law is based on. The law is based on a moral or ethical principle which I was seeking to describe at the outset. Yes, we are generous in terms of welfare, but a person in receipt of welfare has to be honest and frank about their particular financial circumstances.

Whatever one argues about the legal technicalities of this case—being a lawyer myself, one can always find a legal argument to advance, and I am not convinced that this is retrospectivity as we normally understand it—even if one does not agree with me, I think there is in this case a broader moral or ethical principle that this parliament should seek to uphold. It is for that reason we on this side of the chamber will not be opposing this legislation that the government has brought forward.

One is that over a period of more than 10 years a person failed to notify Centrelink that they had worked and earned income while in receipt of Centrelink benefits. As a result, the person obtained social security payments to which they were not entitled of over $100,000. The person was charged pursuant to the Criminal Code, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.

The person defrauded the Common­wealth of over $80,000. Again, there was a prosecution, a conviction and a sentence of imprisonment.

The person neglected to inform Centrelink when the couple had reconciled and, in relation to a separate period, falsely claimed that the couple had separated. The person received over $80,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled. In this case they were charged under the Criminal Code, convicted and released on condition that they be of good behaviour for a specified period.

Over almost seven years, a person received over $70,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled through failing to inform Centrelink of their earnings from full-time employment. The fraud was discovered as a result of a data-matching exercise between Centrelink and the Aust­ralian Taxation Office. Again, this person was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment. I do not believe that any reasonable Australian would regard a circumstance where, because of what is largely a legal technicality, people who had been convicted in those circumstances would have the possibility opened up to them to quash those convictions and, more than that, possibly even claim compensation from the Commonwealth. To use a colloquial expres­sion, it fails the front pub test. It fails the common-sense test of ordinary Australians. That common-sense test is based on this notion that, yes, we are generous, but there is a concomitant duty or responsibility to those who are generous in relation to these payments. It is on the basis of that principle that we will not be opposing this legislation.

I do think this is a very important bill that should be passed by the House and I am pleased that there is support on both sides of the chamber. I am very proud to be an Australian because in Australia we do provide a safety net for those in need. This is something that is ingrained in our psyche as Australians. When people are doing it tough, they do get assistance. I think there is broad support in our community for those who need help to actually get that help. So I am proud that we have a safety net and a social security system in this country.

The vast majority of Australians that go into their local Centrelink in times of trouble and times of need are very upfront and honest and deserve the support that they get, but there are instances, as the previous speaker pointed out, where this is not abided by. A very small minority go in and are not upfront and honest, despite knowing that they should be. This does unfortunately call into question the integrity of all those people receiving these social security payments. It is unfair that the actions of the few cast aspersions on the many who do that right thing. I believe these amendments are very important for the integrity of this system.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          . I believe the intentions of the Commonwealth and the requirements placed on social security recipients have been clear, but based on this technicality that clarity is being called into question. As a result, in many instances where fraud has been proven in a court of law people may get off those charges. That is a concern. It is also a concern that new charges of defrauding the Commonwealth are not necessarily proceed­ing as quickly as they could have because of the lack of clarity at the moment. It is important that we bring forward and pass this legislation, despite the fact that this matter is still going through the High Court. It is the duty of the parliament and the Common­wealth, being responsible for the social security system, to bring this legislation forward. So I am pleased that it has the support of the House.

The many people around the country administ­ering our social security system do a great job on the front line. In my electorate there is a great amount of work being done at the Noarlunga Centrelink office. It is sometimes a tough job. At times there are distressed people, upset people and people in real difficulty, but I believe that Centrelink staff right around this country do a great job. I would like to talk about Noarlunga in particular because I know the staff there do not just sit back and wait for people to come to them; they play a real outreach role in the community. In fact, I attended a special fair day for those suffering from mental illness where all the services got together to talk to the local community. Centrelink was there with the staff and the manager. The manager of a large Centrelink office was there on the front line talking to people, letting them know what they can access and what is available. We know that those who are most vulnerable often do not know what they can access. They can access different payments and services, and sometimes they do not know. Our Centrelink staff have been out there doing that.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There have been many other opportunities where Centrelink staff from Noarlunga have done outreach work. Whether it be youth or Indigenous people, they go into those comm­unities to talk to those people in need who may benefit from a number of services and payments. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Centrelink staff, specifically at Noarlunga but also right around the country, who work in this area. They also need to have confidence that, when they assess someone and they are getting information, they can be confident to act on that information. This legislation ensures that there is that mutual responsib­ility for people to acknowledge when their income changes—and as the previous speaker said, it can be by quite a lot. People know that their income changes. While it might be only a few people, it is important that this legislation is supported. We have an obligation to support it and pass it through the House now because the Australian people, while very generous in their nature and willing to help people in need, do not want to be defrauded. This legislation is really important to ensure that we can have confidence in the integrity of our social security system, that we continue to support those people in need and that those people who defraud the Commonwealth face the consequences of doing so. I commend the bill to the House.

We feel that it does not contravene any fundamental principles of fairness to do so and, on those grounds, we do support the bill. We also want to note that Australia has a long tradition, as previous speakers have noted, of a strong welfare safety net—but also a community expectation that the money has to come from somewhere. Therefore, we are one of the few countries that so effectively, and in such a targeted way, means-test our welfare payments.

In fact, they are far less progressive in that way. They allow people to take an age welfare payment commensurate with their earnings through their career, something that does not happen in Australia. We never want to forget that many hard-working Australians end up being means-tested out of further state support. Regardless of your view about that, we need to remember there is a significant working middle class that do not get the aged-care support that in identical circumstances in other countries they might well have.

We therefore have laws and expect everyone, from east coast to west coast and whatever their background, to adhere to those. You have to play by the rules. I think the Australian sense of fairness comes out no more strongly than in the idea that one should never abuse payments that one receives through our welfare system.

The fact that there have been over 30,000 prosec­utions is, I think, a fair indication of the latter. Ordinary Australians out there would understand that being a dole cheat or a welfare cheat is not something that is acceptable any more, not something that you can laugh about or pat your mate on the back about. That change has come about, quite significantly, over the last two decades through the policies of successive adminis­trations.

There still needs to be an element of self-reporting and that needs to be encouraged, not dissuaded. What is very important about this amendment is, as the shadow minister has suggested, that there will be no new prosecutions as a result of this change. It just ensures that none of the old prosecutions are brought back for review through, potentially, the new light of a High Court decision.

I think most people here, together with most Australians, would admit that it is in the public interest to support the prosecutions which have occurred over the last two decades. The great risk of not standing up to it is that fraud then becomes more prevalent and Australians around the country lose their confidence that this is a welfare system that properly targets those who need it most.

But we feel that, if this legislation is not supported, a whole lot of new cases could potentially be opened. The last thing we want is those prosecutions being called into question. While there is not really any understanding of how many of those are potentially coming before the courts, it may only be a matter of days or weeks before that does occur. Were this bill not passed promptly and expeditiously, we could potentially be exposing Centrelink and the Commonwealth to an enormous burden in having to defend cases which, given how much time has passed and the level of detail in the records we hold, would be very difficult cases to defend.

Although it now looks like you can basically drive a bus through a loophole, at the time it was extremely difficult for those Centrelink drafters of Commonwealth law to understand that what they were drafting could run contrary to an element of the

That is a very important reason for the changes. We also note that the Commonwealth has ceased prosecuting a whole range of cases that, most of us would argue, should be prosecuted and not delayed. That is another very good reason to continue the great work that Australia has done in avoiding Centrelink fraud—to ensure that that is not derailed.

I think it is completely reasonable that we should support these changes and I think it is very important that Centrelink fraud is never considered a legitimate activity in this country. That is the important reason both sides should be supporting these changes.

I also thank the member for Kingston and the member for Bowman for their contributions. It is a good thing that we have had the government, the opposition, the Independ­ents and the minor parties all agreeing it is very important to uphold the principle that, if someone has knowingly done the wrong thing and been pinged for it, they are not let off down the track on a legal technicality. I thank the House for its cooperation.

This was either a sense of a parliamentary committee made of up of clairvoyants able to foresee what they might have thought had they bothered to examine the evidence or a compliant committee where government members simply do what their government masters direct them to do. Thankfully, though, good sense has prevailed. Just as the Treasurer left his Labor colleagues on Standing Committee on Economics hanging with his own amendment to the bill, we had some constructive discussions regarding the consideration in detail amendments to the bill that have been circulated in my name.

I am pleased to say that I think we found a meeting of minds with the government on a number of those amendments. I understand the government will be bringing forward its own version of those amendments, which will address a number of the concerns that we have raised. Those concerns include the need for an ordinary course of business exception for conduct that may be captured by the per se prohibition, a number of specific provisions relating to nominating the process where other markets may be captured by this law and also some specific amendments relating to the financial services sector. I am optimistic that we can find common ground in that area and move forward collaboratively on this bill.

To this the honourable member for Dunkley has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with the view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

This is one of a number of bills that have come before the House recently to moderate the behaviour of Australia's banks—fine institutions that they are. However, one of the roles of government is to regulate and moderate our banks. This legislation says something about the Gillard government's commitment to ensure a better deal for Australian consumers and small businesses. Unfortunately, it might also reflect a general reluctance on the part of banks to always act in a competitive, consumer-friendly manner, without the gentle, moderating, guiding hand of the Gillard Labor government.

This inform­ation is from the statistics and mapping section of the Parliamentary Library. I caution those opposite that I cannot guarantee that some of this information was not prepared by economists. I am pretty sure some of it would have been prepared by economists but I do not have their names to name them. Here are some of the key points. Looking at interest rates, we see the average home loan standard variable interest rate has remained steady for the past seven months at 7.8 per cent. Bankruptcies and business investments are always a good guide to what is actually going on in the money-making section of the community. In the March quarter 2011, total bankruptcies decreased by 17.4 per cent when compared to the same period last year. It is a bit constrained, a bit tight out there, but some of these key indicators suggest that the economy is holding firm. However, we obviously we need to do as much as we can to support it.

That is followed by what is almost a nod and a wink, with the understanding 'if you raise your mortgage rates we'll raise ours too'. Our banks, reliable as they are, have been able to get away with this behaviour because it is done with no formal price agreement and, like a three card trick, it is always done right before our eyes—as I said, through the media. Unfortunately, the losers from this behaviour are Australian consumers, who because of reduced competition face higher interest rates.

The bill before the House amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to prohibit, firstly, the private disclosure of pricing information between competitors outright, which is called the per se prohibition, and, secondly, the disclosure of pricing or other information if made for the purpose of substantially lessening competition. Initially this will apply only to the banking sector, but it could be extended to other areas of the economy after further review.

This amendment targets disclosures that are clearly anticompetitive and damag­ing to consumers. For example, if one bank gets on the phone to another bank to tell them privately about a planned mortgage interest rate rise, the ACCC can take action. As I said, this bill also empowers the ACCC to prosecute a bank for communicating its pricing intentions to substantially lessen competition. This means a bank cannot inform its competitors that it will follow them if they raise mortgage rates.

These are very, very strong civil penalties, but we are talking about banks; we are not talking about the local bowls club. These are significant institutions with significant resources. The prohibitions are, however, subject to specific exclusions to ensure pro-competitive behav­iour is not restricted. These exemptions allow banks to comply fully with their disclosure and legal obligations.

This bill ensures that these business activities can continue through the joint venture exception, which captures act­ual and proposed joint ventures. Banks will also be able to obtain immunity from the prohibition from the ACCC.

It brings Australian law into line with those of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. These laws strike the right balance by enabling banks to get on with their legitimate business while providing the necessary protections for consumers by eliminating anticompetitive price signalling. I commend the bill to the House.

On this side of the House we believe that this is a deeply flawed bill. We do not disagree that there is an issue which needs to be add­ressed, which is why the coalition brought forward our own bill, the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010. But we believe that the approach taken in the bill that the government has put before the House raises some very serious issues.

In the private context it creates a so-called per se prohib­ition on the private disclosure of pricing information to competitors. 'Per se' means that the disclosure does not need to be for the purpose of substantially lessening compet­ition, nor does it need to have that effect. In both the private and the public contexts, the bill contains a general disclosure prohibition of the disclosure of pricing information. That is also, we will argue, a prohibition that raises significant policy issues.

Unfortunately, the question of whether the balance has been properly struck is not the one which appears to be principally motivating the government in its approach to this piece of legislation. This legislation ultimately is being driven by political considerations and the desire of the Treasu­rer to be seen to be doing something. The result, unfortunately, is a piecemeal measure with, in its current form, many unintended consequences.

But there remain many fundamentally troubling aspec­ts of this piece of legislation, and the basis upon which the legislation has been developed is also extremely troubling. The consultation process that was employed in arriving at the introduction of this bill was seriously flawed. A draft exposure bill, for example, was provided for comment on 12 December last year, with comments due by 14 January. It really is very far from good practice in consultation with industry to require very detailed consideration of wide-ranging reforms to be provided in the middle of the Christmas holiday period.

The first point is that one of the central provisions of this bill, the so-called per se prohibition, is bad policy. I secondly want to argue that a measure which is specific to one sector—in this case, the banking sector—is also bad policy. I thirdly want to argue that to give the Treasurer the capacity to extend, by regulation, the measures contained in this bill to other sectors without needing to come back to the parliament is also bad policy. I fourthly want to highlight the poor policy consequences of the inconsistency between the regime set out in this bill and the well-established continuous disclosure rules which apply to listed companies, including of course the major banks which are listed.

It means that if the specified conduct is found to have occurred then it becomes irrelevant as to whether there was any anticompetitive purpose in carrying out that conduct. Indeed it is also irrelevant whether there was any anticompetitive effect. In other words, if the conduct occurs then it matters not whether there was any intention, any purpose, to lessen competition. Nor does it matter whether there was actually the effect of lessening competition. There is simply a blanket prohibition on private disclosure of the relevant pricing information.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The arguments that can be made that circumstances in which one bank or executives of one bank meet privately with another to discuss pricing information and the arguments that can be made about the anticompetitive consequences of that are clearly forceful. But if you say, 'We do not really care whether the conduct actually has an anticompetitive effect. We do not really care whether there was an intention, a purpose, of reducing competition in meeting to have these private discussions,' then you are missing the whole point of what policy ought to do in the case of seeking to maintain and strengthen competition. Policy ought to focus on conduct which has an effect of reducing competition; policy also ought to focus on conduct which is intended to reduce competition—that is to say, which has the purpose of reducing competition—even if, for reasons that are beyond the capacity of those who have joined together to have the conversation, it does not result ultimately in the anticompetitive effect. But there is another even more fundamental point, which is this: there are often circumstances in which private disclosures can be procom­petitive, and there are certainly an extensive range of situations in which private disclosures can be necessary and desirable in the carrying on of business and are not harmful to competition. When you look at the provisions in the bill before the House, you will see that the scope of what is caught by this provision is very wide. It includes historic, aggregated and non-confidential data.

They cite syndicated lending, which of necessity involves more than one bank. Typically in a syndicate there are many banks. They talk about loan switching, where a customer switches a loan from one bank to another, or a situation where two or more lenders are dealing with a financially distressed business—perhaps a business which has received loans from a syndicate and some time later it transpires that the business is in financial distress and the banks need to engage in consultations to work out how they are to deal with this business. The approach which the government has taken to this problem is to set out a specific range of exemptions in which the per se prohibition will not apply. But that is poor policy. It would be much more sensible not to start with a per se prohibition in the first place. It would be much more likely to produce a rational policy outcome.

It is a very curious approach indeed to competition policy to say that certain conduct, if carried out by bankers, is anticompetitive; but, if carried out by airline executives or pharmac­eutical industry executives or telecomm­unications sector executives or agricultural industry executives, is not anticompetitive. Under the provisions contained in this bill conduct in one industry will attract potentially criminal penalties, whereas cond­uct of exactly the same kind carried out by executives in different industries, carried out by companies in different industries, will not attract a penalty. It is impossible to see the policy rationale for such inconsistent treat­ment. The Swanson, Hilmer and Dawson reviews all found that competition law prohibitions as a general principal ought to apply across the board.

This grants excessive disc­retion to the executive government. The perception, based upon what has been stated publicly by this government in seeking to justify the measures in this bill, is that this is a bill directed towards the banking sector. It is true that in its initial application it will apply only to the banking sector, but it also provides for other sectors to be specified by regulation and so the prohibitions in the bill will apply to them.

The preferred approach, as I have indicated, would be to have a legal regime in this area which applied uniformly. But if you are going to, as this government appears to be doing, introduce measures directed to one sector, it is then very hard to understand why you retain the flexibility, why you retain the discretion, to extend this to other sectors without coming back to the parliament. The imposition of the prohib­itions contained in this bill is a substantial policy matter and it is one which ought to be considered by the parliament rather than imposed by regulation.

We on this side of the House certainly think that very substantial amendment is needed before it can be supported.

This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to competition and consumer law reform and to ensuring that ordinary Australians experience the benefits of a strong economy. Those opposite attempt to decry the word 'competition' as a Labor word. I assert that in a genuinely competitive economy consumers benefit because of lower prices and the economy benefits as a whole because of the need for business to be more efficient. A truly competitive economy is a Labor ideal that benefits working families. It benefits working families bec­ause a competitive economy can provide goods and services that are of a lower cost and better quality. Whilst those opposite may argue that they are the party of small business and competition, it is the Labor Party and Labor governments that have successively and truly achieved central reform in this area.

This has occurred because banks are able to signal, before a potential increase in the cash rate targets, an intention to increase the home loan rate to a level beyond the cash rate. This lowers the fears of competitors that they might lose customers if they act in the same manner. The result of this signalling is a breakdown in the competitive forces in the provision of home loans and it negatively affects hardworking families for whom loan repayments can make up a really significant part of the family budget.

We also need to ensure that the effectiveness of our aid is maintained by increased scrutiny and transparency. The coalition not only believe in the delivery of a tougher, more accountable aid program but also have always believed that there should be greater emphasis on a cooperative approach, partic­ularly through working with other governments and other aid organisations, as well as with Australia's corporate sector.

To maximise the benefits and assistance that we can provide, the coalition have always believed that Australia's corporate aid programs need to be well coordinated to mesh with our global focus and our country-specific programs. In addition to AusAID spending, greater coord­ination and tracking of international aid donations and philanthropy should be identified and coordinated.

We believe a greater focus on basic education, particularly for girls, is the most effective form of long-term educational investment. Current rates of females being educated remain much lower than that of males, and addressing this is the first step in our commitment to the development of women leaders in our region. Improved educational opportunities for girls will also translate into improved economic and health outcomes.

I also support a whole-of-government approach to strengthening planning, mon­itoring and reporting. The establishment of the Development Effectiveness Steering Committee to achieve this is also very welcome.

We recognise that foreign aid spending in other parts of the world is essential. We support the recommendations, and the major focus of the foreign aid budget should primarily be within our region and continue to grow there.

You know it isn't. It's just another bogan suburb, out in the boondocks, whatever a boondock is; out in the sticks, or is it the Styx? What does Doveton have to show us about how those in the 'outer suburbs' might live? Doveton is dark, damp and quiet one morning early in winter. The

It is a suburb with character, heart and a sense of community spirit. I know of the many warm and friendly community minded people that make Doveton a treasure of a suburb. These include people like Les Boyes, Jean Westerman and the late Heather Weston, whose contribution to Doveton I have raised in this place before.

Community involvement has always been a passion of Les, who holds a life membership of the Oak Avenue Community Hall. The Oak Avenue Community Hall has held neighbourhood meetings and barbecues over the years to bring together the local neighbours. The 75-year-old is also a life member at Casey radio and on the committee of Myuna Farm. Every Thursday, Les and the other members at the Doveton club make children's toys out of egg cartons and cardboard boxes. Mr Boyes and his wife Helene have been living in their Oak Avenue home for 40 years. Les and Helene symbolise the Neighbour Day spirit—they have a tremendous amount of pride in their neighbourhood and a commitment to bring­ing people together to build a strong sense of community. I know Les is battling illness. I wish him a speedy recovery.

She overcame the odds and her work influenced countless individ­uals who crossed her path. When Heather became involved with the Doveton Neighbourhood House she was, in her words, illiterate and often felt that she was 'good at nothing'. Not to be overcome by this, Heather quickly enrolled in basic English reading and writing courses at Doveton Neighbourhood House, forming an affinity with the centre that would see her spend 15 years on its committee, holding the positions of assistant to the treasurer, vice-president, secretary and president. In fact, Heather spent a total of three years as the centre's president. These are significant achievements in themselves, but Heather's true achievement—and, indeed, where her passion lay—was in inspiring and driving others. She used her success against her plight to empower others in the community to emulate her achievements.

Their contributions hit home for the Camden branch when one of their very own, Honorary Junior Vice President Declan Robert Sheehy, now aged 10 months, suffered complications after birth and required the use of a foetal monitor incubator, oxygen crib and ultraviolet light. It was this very equipment that the Kids of Macarthur, with support from the Camden old bastards, had purchased.

I hope that this junior order will continue to keep the old bastard community spirit alive for many decades to come. Little Declan's story is a very real reminder of just how lucky the electorate of Macarthur is to have so many community-minded people contributing their time, effort and hard earned money towards the many charities and causes of the region.

To their great credit, in January this year 98 per cent of the 8.5 million people of Southern Sudan, many of whom are illiterate, simply drew a hand with the word 'separation' on it, voting in favour of independence. At the time I hailed the vote, stating:

However, the flourishing of Southern Sudan as a nation can only be successful with the support of the international community. We must not let that region slide back into civil war. Many members of this House have a more intimate involvement with that situation, having many fine immigrants—indeed refugees—from Sudan in their electorates. Despite the momentous vote for independence, Southern Sudan faces enormous obstacles on becoming a new nation. Only 15 per cent of adults can read and write, more than half the population live on less than 75c a day, 47 per cent of the populace is described as being 'food deprived' and the life expectancy at birth is 42. Despite the current 6.7 billion barrels of oil reserves of Sudan, being the nation in general, Southern Sudan is heavily underdeveloped. Prior to its independence, 470,000 barrels of oil were pumped per day, three-quarters of which came from the south and the border regions. Unfortunately, the people of that region have not benefited from that. With reports of crackdowns and violence in the Nuba Mountains and in Northern Kordofan and continued tensions over Abyei, where the oil is produced, Southern Sudan faces an enormous challenge.

Within our humanity we should strive to give our children better than we ourselves received. If Australia can play its small part in lifting the children of Southern Sudan out of abject poverty, by assisting with the development of universal education and with nation building, we will surely be on our way to alleviating some of the ills that the Southern Sudanese people have suffered. The hope that was shown by the Southern Sudanese people who came out and voted in droves for independence and their belief that the day after tomorrow will be a better one than the one before should show that this newest country, even with its enormous challenges, is capable—as all people are—of overcoming obstacles for a brighter future. I hope to attend the independence celebrations in Southern Sudan, and I know that the people of Australia wish the people of Southern Sudan well.

Australians in the majority do not want this tax which will clean out their wallets and cost jobs without doing a single thing for the environment. This debate should be about the best way to achieve a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020. On one hand, you have the Labor-Greens tax, which will add hundreds of dollars to the average household budget and cripple our mining and aluminium industries forcing jobs, investment and emissions offshore. On the other hand, you have the coalition's direct action plan, which will use incentives and investment to make a real change in people's habits. The Labor-Greens alliance has made this a debate about party politics. Prime Minister Gillard has sacrificed the will of the people she represents for her own political desires. She has fallen to the whim 'co-Prime Minister'

The frustration and anger in my electorate of Paterson is palpable. For Labor, politics no longer means representing the people. It means representing self interest. Take, for example, this today.

I have already sent her an invitation to come to my electorate of Paterson to participate in a town hall discussion. That way, Ms Gillard can address the concerns about job losses and rising household budget pressures. The Prime Minister can also try to explain to local residents how on earth a tax will help the environment. I look forward to her response and yet for some reason I do not think that she will accept.

Judging by the number of people calling me from the member for Lyne's electorate, they do not want a carbon tax either. The same goes for callers from the electorates of Hunter, Newcastle, Charlton and Shortland. They call my office because they know they fall upon deaf ears when they ring those members. That is why I am here fighting for the future of our country, which will be so heavily disadvantaged by a carbon tax, not only economically but also environmentally. I urge the Prime Minister and her colleagues to listen to the people who voted for them.

Secondly, the Treasurer called the coalition 'hysterical scaremongers' when we tried to tell the people there would be a carbon tax under a Labor government.

There had been a town crier before him, Roy Bowling, who had been there for a long time. Trevor paid tribute to him and said Roy had been a mentor. He said his win was not just about the voice, volume level and control. Clearly, it is about voice clarity, pronunciation, volume control, volume level and the cries—those are assessed—but it is also the costume, known as regalia. He has that custom made, and donated, by Kerri Benson, of Sea Eagle Fashions in Maclean. Maclean is in the neighbouring seat of Cowper but is very close to my electorate.

Of course, everybody was sad to see his predecessor Roy go but it was great to see somebody want to take it up. As well as being the town crier, Trevor Green is a paramedic so he has a very noble day job. Well done, Trevor, and may we continue to hear the town crying go on and continue that tradition.

Setting up any small business can be seen as a risk but isn't it wonderful that we have people who take that risk. He also said he had been making fudge for as long as he can remember, since he was five or six. He said his mother taught him how to make it—it is his grandma's recipe—but that it was also an art and a science. I make fudge, but for me it is neither an art nor a science. It is a long time since I have made it and I am sure it would not be anything like Gary's. I will just keep eating his fudge.

There are now only 17,000. They are free to leave. In fact, a bus pulls up outside the camp and people are free to leave at any time they choose. We discussed this with the people in their homes. They cannot return to their villages because they are still mined. Many of them do not have a village to return to because it was shelled and demolished during the civil war. In fact, the people I spoke to at Manik Farm quite often do not have a place to go to because, as I said, it has been ruined.

The Indian government has promised 50,000 but has not built one, so it was a very shallow promise. I say to those who want to criticise this democratically elected government in its efforts to provide reconciliation and reconstruction: you need to get across the facts before you slur a democratically elected government like the sovereign state of Sri Lanka.

For a while now we have been working on a particular project that the federal government has been supporting financially. We launched it last Friday in the electorate. This is a new online service directory that will bring together all of the Illawarra mining technology service and manufacturing businesses in one place, so that we can reach into the capacity for these businesses to be part of the current and what I am absolutely certain will be the ongoing mining boom in this nation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

Ringway is a local business that is an electronics and electrical supplier to the mining industry. Ringway Control are a part of i3net that I referred to earlier, the innovative engineering and manufacturing sector in my region. We were joined there by various representatives, including Ray Tolhurst representing the Aus­tralian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Illawarra branch and representatives of Ringway business including local represen­tatives of the Ai Group, and we launched this fantastic website.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              As I indicated, it is an initiative that we believe reflects our confidence and optimism for the future of this sector in the local area. I certainly encourage anybody who is not already on the directory to join up. It is at www.miningsupplierdirectory.com.au. More importantly, we are hoping that mining sectors across the nation wanting suppliers and manufacturers to provide for their boom period will look to this directory to provide new employment and job opportunities to our region. It is a very important capacity for building our manufacturing and services sector locally, in particular allowing them to participate and take advantage of the mining boom as it rolls out across the nation.

He gave me a tour. I had a look at a lot of the equipment and the work that they were doing there, particularly around the conveyor belt safety systems, a really good initiative. My father was an electrical mines inspector, so it was very interesting to me to see some of the advances that have occurred in the industry. I thank Rod and his team for their hospitality in taking us through that. I finish up each expressing my great optimism in the future not only of the mining sector in the Illawarra but also of its associated manufacturing base.

During the war it is estimated that some 100,000 served alongside the US as allies. It should be remembered that about half the Montagnards are Protestant and 20 per cent are Catholic.

Thousands of Montagnards fled Vietnam to Cambodia while several thousand were resettled in the United States. Many Montagnard political and religious leaders were executed by the communists. The Montagnard suffered greatly during the Vietnam War. I have been told that 200,000 died and 85 per cent of their traditional villages were destroyed. Since then their existence has been defined by persecution on the basis of post-war retribution and religious persecution.

Scott has been to the Central Highlands and he has seen the terrible conditions of poverty under which the Montagnards live. Scott has told me that there is no evidence whatsoever of Montagnard resistance movements that advocate armed opposition and violence. Yet there is a paranoia from the Vietnamese government who choose to see the refusal of Montagnards to worship in the state controlled churches as a cover for an independence movement.

I find it incredible that such nebulous charges as undermining national solidarity or disrupting security can result in a person being jailed, but that is the reality in Vietnam. I also note that Human Rights Watch report that some 25 Montagnard prisoners have died while in custody or shortly after release.

They confiscate land and give it to non-Montagnard people. They oppress those who wish to worship freely and then, when there is resentment and protest, the Communist officials actually wonder why. It seems that this is a case of delusional paranoia. If the Vietnamese government left the Montagnards alone, they would not have such problems.

I conclude by calling upon the government of Vietnam to restore the ancestral lands they have taken from the Montagnards, to release the hundreds of Montagnard religious and political prisoners currently held in Vietnam and to allow religious freedom across Vietnam.

The first petition of 13,828 citizens asks the House to ensure that medical research remains properly funded and is resourced into the future. The second petition of 345 citizens requests the House to legislate to put a price on pollution that reduces carbon emissions and to protect the Murray-Darling Basin for future generations. To assist proceedings, I can inform the House that both have been examined by the Petitions Committee and have been found to be in order.

The Discoveries Need Dollars campaign united community groups and sector workers from across the country. I congratulate that campaign and the scores of grassroots campaigners—some of whom I hope are watching now and are using the Twitter hashtag '#protectresearch'—who worked to achieve such an important outcome in the budget, particularly in protecting funding to the

That treatment has the potential to revolutionise the lives of those who are suffering from diabetes as well as the lives of their families.

That consequence is a very important one because, as I have said, the electorate of Melbourne has more health and medical researchers than any other electorate in the country and, if we are serious about improving the quality of life of Australians and continuing to lead the world in medical discovery, as many of those people in Melbourne do, we should be steadily increasing funding, not potentially decrea­sing it. The quality and security of funding is just as important as the amount. One of the things that is increasingly clear is that, because funding is often only on a rolling three-year basis and is so insecure, many young researchers are choosing to go overseas not to broaden their knowledge but because it is one of the few places they can be guaranteed tenure and a secure career. Researchers have obligations, mortgages and rent to pay just like everyone else and their funding, their salaries and their livelihoods should not depend on rolling three-year contracts if they are lucky.

Close to 14,000 people signed the petition that I am proud to present today. I know that the government has commissioned a strategic review of Australian medical research fund­ing, with the terms of reference announced today, to better plan the resourcing of the sector, to focus its work on community expectations and to improve accessibility and affordability of disease treatments and diagnosis methods that arise from a properly funded research sector. This is a tremendous outcome from the campaign and I congratulate the minister for taking this step. Parliament should stand reminded of the strength of the medical research community and the expectations of the wider comm­unity. Australians value public investment in medical research and will not support any further attempts to undermine the sector. Lastly, I would like to pay special tribute to the staff and directors at the

We had a good discussion at that meeting and a range of views were expressed, including a number of people highlighting the importance to Australia of foreign investment. This issue has been getting a lot of scrutiny recently. I want to make three key points in the brief time available: first, to welcome some of the additional scrutiny; second, to make a key point about the two issues involved, on the one hand foreign ownership and on the other hand the impact of mining on agricultural land; third, to highlight the importance of foreign investment.

I want to make the point that there are two conceptually separate issues that can sometimes get bundled together as the one issue. The first issue is the general question of foreign ownership of Australian assets, including agricultural land amongst a range of other assets based or located in Australia. That is one issue. The second issue, which is a conceptually distinct issue, is the impact of mining on agricultural land. A range of concerns have been expressed about this issue by residents of affected communities and this is an issue which is, as are many others, always susceptible to further investigation. I think it is important that we do not automatically conflate the two issues and assume that the central question, in thinking about the impact of mining on agricultural land, is the ownership of the mining company. It seems to me that the central question is the trade-off between the competing uses of land. As I have indicated, I certainly welcome the fact there is scrutiny of both sets of issues. Once that process has been worked through, no doubt there will be some recommendations to consider.

Australia is a net importer of capital. In the March quarter of 2011, net inflow was $780 billion. Outflows of capital were $1.24 trillion; inflows were $2.02 trillion—in other words, a lot more money came in than went out. It is, I think, quite self-evident, when you look at the Australian economy and the prosperity we enjoy, that a significant contributor to that prosperity has been foreign investment.

Total inflows of foreign investment in the year 2009 were $160 billion and, of that, $94 billion came from the US and $34 billion came from the UK. So the Australian economy has always depended very heavily on the inflow of foreign capital. The prosperity of Australia and its people is heavily dependent, I would argue, upon continuing to have a set of policies and a set of frameworks which are attractive to foreign capital. We are competing with many other countries around the world for investment and that is a factor that we need bear mind as we weigh up all the considerations in this set of issues I have raised—a set of issues which is attracting continuing public scrutiny and on which there is, properly, policy scrutiny. We must bear in mind, I would argue, the importance of foreign investment to Australia's prosperity.

Courage and tenacity has driven the Egyptians in their fight for democratic rights, but with this fight there must be an equal determination to honour the right to freedom of religion and culture.

They deserve what we all enjoy: freedom, peace, security and the right to practice their religion free from persecution.

They also delivered some import­ant messages to the students about the need to build their bank of personal skills by staying on in school as long as they can and about ensuring they eat well and exercise often to see the benefit this generates for their personal health.

It is rare to describe someone as iconic, but, when it comes to Sydney basketball, Bob Turner wears that label well. I was not the only Sydneysider celebrating the return of an NBL side to our great city last year. Bob Turner played a healthy part in making that happen and, in his own way, he helped draw some of the biggest crowds in the league. It was terrific to be present for some fantastic home games at the Kingdome. Bob was also instrumental in beginning to refashion the franchise's approach to community engagement. It became something of an emerging, fast-growing passion for Bob—using his love of the game to try to shape closer links between the sport and community.

There are those who would like it removed from this House or both houses. That is not something we agree with and it is why many thousands of people signed this petition during the last parliament to cement this act of faith and quietness and, as John Wilson said, for those who do not pray, this time of reflection. It is something we can give back to the nation and ourselves, and I hope and pray that this parliament, the House and the Senate, will continue with the practice of using the Lord's Prayer every day that we come together to meet.

I spent a lot of time talking with Jack about the design of the building during 2009 and 2010 to make sure it was what the school wanted and also that it fitted in with the area and took account of the residents. Although it was a long process, we got to the point where the school got exactly what they wanted, which was what we were after the whole time.

That meant that we had every school principal since the school was merged from three into one recognised at the ceremony. We also had the President of the School Council, Lloyd Lazaro, and the former school council president, Tim Purkis—not forgetting that we had there all of the staff, more than 550 students and many parents as well. It was a very big event.

In fact, it is fair to say that it would not have happened without their help. Rangeview is a great local school and has a proud history of excellence in education and it has grown to become one of the biggest and most popular government schools within the electorate of Deakin. In fact, if you are not in the zone, it is particularly hard to now get into the school. At the opening ceremony, the school band and choir put on a great performance and a skipping troupe finished off the ceremony. I have not seen kids do that sort of thing with skipping ropes before, but it was very impressive. I am sure that some of them will go to feature in a

I have been to Rangeview on many occasions and they have had to hold school assemblies outside. I have also attended the school on days on which there has not been a school assembly because it has been cancelled due to rain. Now with a full-size hall they can fit the whole school within that hall and have their assemblies at any time they like, as well as using it for sport, music and after-school-hours care. It is a great addition to the school. I am sure that it is something that will be there for many years to come not only for the students who are currently there but hopefully for students from generations well beyond them. I congratulate Rangeview Primary School on their great result under the P21 and encourage more schools to take advantage of that.

It is a fundamentally important part of our economy that the Labor Party do not appreciate and have never appreciated. They are interested in big employer organisations, big industry associations and big unions. That is what Labor have always stood for. They have never been interested in the forgotten people in our economy, the heartbeat of the economy who provide 48 per cent of private sector employment. There are some 731,000 small businesses in Australia employing from one to 20 people. There are over one million small businesses defined as not employing people. That means that there are nearly two million in total. In Mayo alone, there are over 4,000 employing between one and 20 people and 8,500 defined as non-employing. That is 12,000 in total.

Worse than that, they are putting more pressure on them. Before the 2007 election there was this grand promise of one regulation in for one regulation out. What we have seen from the Labor Party in this area is some 12,835 new regulations with a reduction of only 58. This is not one in, one out—far from it. It is a concerted attack on the heartbeat of our economy. It is an area for which we must stand up. We must represent our constituency in this respect. We have to take the pressure off small business. They are the great entrepreneurs in our economy; they are the great employment growth centre of our economy. At the moment, they are under significant pressure. It is the responsibility of our side of politics to hold his government to account and to outline how we would manage that part of the economy far better than the Labor Party.

One student spoke about arriving in Australia after living in a refugee camp in Syria, but sadly is still waiting for their father to join them. A student at Liverpool Boys High School escaped war-torn Congo. He spent five years in a refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in Australia. Like many other refugee children he excels in his education, taking advantage of what we in this country have to offer.

As a member of parliament I have the pleasure of supporting and assisting the great work that many of these community organisations do. I look forward to working closely with them into the future. I thank Solomon Tesfay for the work he is doing on behalf of his community. I also mention the great work that is being done by the Liverpool Migrant Resource Centre and the Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre. I praise the efforts of Kamalle Dabboussy and Ricci Bartels. They certainly do understand the need to help resettle people, including refugees, and the trauma associated with these people's migration to Australia.

Last week I attended a council meeting with the member for Werriwa. Several councillors raised their great concern about how they would be able to balance their budget under the carbon tax. It appears they will have to wait until Sunday to find out more information, but in the meantime they face great uncertainty about what will be taxed and what expenses the local council will face.

This figure is for the period before the recent very large increases in the price of electricity, so for the last financial year Liverpool council is looking at somewhere around $3 million for its electricity bill. If the rumours we hear are true, Liverpool council could be faced with a $500,000, $600,000 or $700,000 increase in its electricity bill. This places the council in a position where it does not know how it will find the extra $500,000 or $600,000. It has two choices: cut back on services or raise its rates to residents. If it cuts back on services, what is it going to do? Is it going to turn off the street lights at night? That will add to residents' security fears. Is it going to cut back on the childcare centres and early childhood services it operates? Is it going to cut back on its migrant resource centres? Is it going to cut back on its rubbish and recycling collection? These are decisions that will face every council in our nation in the coming weeks—what services they will cut back because of this new tax that Labor is implementing. Perhaps there is just one more thing we can be certain about, that this pervasive tax will weave its way through the economy, both with a devastating effect on the cost of living and placing Australian businesses at a competitive disadvantage internationally.

Can someone stand up and tell us how much this carbon tax will reduce the temperature by, because that is what it is aimed at doing? If we cannot answer that, why are we putting our local councils under so much pressure where they will have to reduce so many services?

The Tasmanian government is poised to lend an undisclosed amount of taxpayers' money to a newly registered $24 company so it can purchase Gunns' foundering Triabunna woodchip mill. This is outrageous, because the handout would be just another thinly veiled payout to the company struggling to manage its daily cash flow, let alone build its stinking

Apparently, the loan has been all but signed off. But the Tasmanian government, true to form, are refusing to tell us how much of our money they are pouring into the deal and under what conditions.

But this deal is particularly distasteful because it comes at a time when the Labor-Greens government is so cash strapped that it has been canvassing the idea of closing some of our very best schools and is set to cut the number of nurses and police.

Just last week, for example, the federal government needed to intervene and grant $50,000 to keep Sustainable Living Tasmania afloat. And, in April, federal funding of $350,000 was provided to allow the Holyoake organisation to revive its drug, alcohol and gambling addiction service. I despair that I have got a long list of other worthy electorate causes in need, most of which must go unmet.

And, in another stunning measure of the government, this year $11 million was allocated on the sly for a racetrack, despite the state government preparing to bring down a horror budget.

It does not have to be this way.

He was talking about the problems with the Tasmanian Labor-Greens government. Today I rise to speak in my constituency statement to also talk about problems with the current federal Labor-Greens government. The issue that I am going to focus on today is of concern to all Australians and, in particular, to those in my federal electorate of Higgins, and that is to ensure that all Australians receive the very best health care that they can and receive the best health care when they need it. For many Australians, the opportunity for choice in their health care was broadened very significantly when the coalition government brought in government rebates for private health insurance and made it more affordable for many Australians and their families. This week, though, the government will again attempt—for the third time—to means-test the private health insurance rebate.

If you can say one thing about the Greens on this particular issue, it is: at least they have been consistent. They are ideologically opposed to private health insurance and will do everything within their power to stop any government rebate for private health insurance. The Labor Party, however, has been much more duplicitous. To get an idea of how duplicitous the Labor Party has been on this issue, let us take a look back.

Foreign investment in Australia is not a new phenomenon, with substantial assets having originated from foreign investment. It can fairly be argued that foreign investment has brought with it considerable prosperity. But times are changing. With the world population predicted to exceed nine billion, the earth's resources are becoming more valuable. Food, water and mineral resources are being depleted, whilst demand for those resources simultaneously increases.

Other countries are not so fortunate. Whereas in the past foreign investment was primarily driven by private sector investment opportunities and business growth, in the future it will be more about food and resource security. There is a clear pattern emerging. Global resources, including those in Australia, are being targeted by foreign governments with hungry, growing populations. Already, substantial levels of foreign investment are being made in resources and food production in

However, we do not see very much large-scale foreign investment in manufacturing and other non-resource and non-food sectors, unless it is part of a global strategy to control the global supply of goods.

The huge reaction around the nation proved that this truly vital sector is critical if we are to maintain our present health and wellbeing and, more importantly, to make discoveries which continue to change our lives and ease the burden of health costs on the economy for the future. I find it incomprehensible that the Gillard government considered cutting funding to medical research whilst we are undergoing one of the most significant changes to our demographic in Australian history. The rapid ageing of our population is placing a major burden on our society. A large proportion of the financial burden will, of course, be in health care. It is estimated that, whilst the baby boomer generation gained about $3 value for every $1 they contributed in taxes, generation Y and those following will conversely contribute approximately $3 in taxes for every $1 of government spending they receive. This is just one of the reasons we must continue to fund medical research. Another is value for money. It is estimated that medical research returns up to $6 for every $1 invested in its development. That is considered a good return in any business model.

Antibiotics transformed medicine when first discovered in 1928. Their discovery dramatically improved the standard of living, increasing the ease with which disease can be treated to an extent where we can hardly imagine a world without them. However, like all things in our ever-changing world, bacteria have adapted and developed new resistance mechanisms to overcome the effects of many antibiotics in their current form. This means that some patients cannot be treated for life-threatening infections such as golden staph. This is why Professor Matt Cooper has received a grant to develop ways to overcome these new superbugs, targeting two existing antibiotics to create new, more powerful drugs which can treat these infections. Professor Cooper and his team aim to have these drugs ready for human clinical trial within the next five years.

Whilst no decision was made to close the facility, I thought it was particularly important that residents had an opportunity to show the level of support they have for that local post office.

I made clear to them at that time that this post office was one which was very important to the citizens of Kensington. I have 6,001 enrolled residents of Kensington and about 1,600 of them are aged 60 and over. I have a particular concern that, if this post office were to be closed, these elderly residents and residents that might have difficulty getting to an adjoining suburb such as Kingsford or Randwick, where the post offices are highly patronised, would experience significant additional inconvenience.

This is a suburb which is likely to see increasing numbers of people moving there, particularly as developments like this are considered by the local council.

I want to thank residents for getting involved in this campaign. I seek leave to present a petition asking the House to take whatever steps are required to ensure that the Kensington Post Office remains open and that its postal services remain available to the community. I have this petition here and I seek leave to table it.

There is broad acceptance in the community that they are desirable and that they should continue. However, the situation is that, while this bill enables these programs to have additional funding and to continue, it regrettably does not give permanence to them. The government says that the programs are under review, and I suspect that most people would agree that this is a government by review. There are excessive reviews by this government. By all means review those matters which need to be reviewed but, when there is bipartisan agreement on the very successful nature of the programs mentioned in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill, why investigate something that everyone agrees is going well?

I suspect that, while a review is underway, ultimately the government will support the ongoing nature of these programs, but since there seems to be a community consensus and certainly a consensus in the parliament, and the results are clear on the board, about these programs they ought not continue to be 'reviewed'; they ought to be the subject of a statement by the minister saying these are good programs, these are programs which will be funded indefinitely into the future. Frankly, as a nation we do not have a lot to be proud of in the area of Indigenous affairs. As I was saying yesterday, we sought to throw money at the problem; we tried to salve the nation's collective conscience by throwing money at the problem without focusing on necessary outcomes.

I was really impressed when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs crossed the chamber and congratulated the member for Hasluck, who is a role model for all Indigenous Australians. The member for Hasluck—and I do not really like to talk about someone else's philosophy—sees education as being the way forward and the way to address disadvantage. When one sees the success that the member for Hasluck has been in his life, starting from a position of relative disadvantage, it is very clear that education is extraordinarily important.

It is a bill that I commend and support, but I ask the government to cease reviewing these programs and give them a tick of permanence. They deserve it, they have got outcomes and they are achieving what they seek to achieve. The result is that young Indigenous Australians have a better chance of taking their place as people who are able to be successful Australians in every sphere of endeavour. So this is a good bill and these are good programs with which good outcomes are being achieved. I think, though, that the community and the parliament need reassurance from the government that these programs are going to be permanently funded and permanently supported, because they are doing such a wonderful job for those Australians who for too long have been disadvantaged. I commend the bill to the House.

The bill provides for the appropriation of $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments over 2013. This funding amount also includes adjustments to appropriations made as a result of previous decisions of government, including in relation to the new federal financial arrangements framework. In accordance with the government's policy, the legislated figure will be adjusted for price movements. The bill also provides $25.5 million for Abstudy away-from-base payments. The total appropriation for both components is $159 million in 2013. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 provides a legislative basis and appropriate funding for a variety of Aboriginal education programs for the tertiary sector.

Both programs have achieved considerable success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. However, this Labor government has not committed to long-term funding for these two initiatives. Instead, it has simply provided a 12-month extension in the past two budgets. The extension has been described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the Review of Funding for Schooling report, which is due some time in 2011. But by the government's own admission the review is focused on the mainstream. There may—only 'may'—be some implications for the design and operation of programs run by the IETA Act.

Labor is paralysed by endless reviews. It has described this year as the year of delivery and decision. I say it is the year of more debt and more delay. At least the Prime Minister got the Ds right. A one-year extension of funding for the second year in a row by the Gillard Labor government limits the funding and therefore holds hostage future planning for more successful programs and long-term funding prospects. It seems this uncommitted government is trying to drive a wedge in good programs which re-engage Aboriginal students with learning and bettering their future.

The act allowed the minister to make an agreement with education providers, or other persons or bodies, authorising payments during the 2001 to 2009 calendar years. There is enormous frustration that this Gillard-Rudd government is simply without ideas. We have had 4½ years of Labor rolling off figures about Aboriginal disadvantage; however, even when the solution is handed to it from the previous coalition government, it still does not seem fit to implement it. It may want to set a 'closing the gap' figure for 2020, long after this government is gone and hopefully some of its mess is cleaned up; however, it will be unable to account for its lack of action. That will lie in the hands of future generations.

This government is quite happy to apologise for the actions of others generations ago, but it seems it is unable to face up to its own inaction and apologise for it. There are many opportunities for Aboriginal youth to do better and to involve themselves in the community, and with help from government a re-engagement with learning can be instilled into these children. But, if this government will not commit to ensuring long-term education funding, how can the children commit to their own education? This government is not really showing a good example. Given opportunity, Aboriginal children are just as capable as any other children of succeeding in our community.

It is a passion that they are so very good at. Too often Aboriginal youths are overrepresented among those displaying antisocial behaviour. That seems to occur across Australia and it certainly occurs in the Riverina. It is because in some cases they do not get the proper parental direction, or because they have nothing meaningful to do with their lives because there is not the opportunity that should be encouraged more and more by government, or because, in some instances, they just do not know how to be involved in the wider community.

The Gillard-Rudd Labor government has made a lot of promises under its Closing the Gap initiative; however, we and they, the Aboriginal population, need more than just words. Aboriginal Australians are counting on the Prime Minister to deliver real action and real results in education, housing, health care and, of course, sporting opportunities. Unfortunately this government has proven too many times to be nothing but talk.

This is highly commendable and I thank the government for supporting the coalition initiative that has been developed over so many years. The previous coalition government was committed to Indigenous programs and in the 2007-08 budget $4 billion was put aside for Aboriginal programs and services. There was a 67 per cent real increase on the amount that had been spent by the Keating Labor government in 1995-96. The coalition government was particularly committed to Indigenous education through initiatives such as the

From 1998 to 2005, the participation of Aboriginal students in year 12 increased from 32 per cent to 40 per cent. Participation in year 11 increased from 52 per cent to 62 per cent. But we can always do better and we must do better. Education is one of the many ways to the future for Aboriginal Australians.

The Labor-Green-Independents government has professed the same commitment but we have yet to see any real positive action. There is a long way to go in Indigenous education. On such an important issue, the government needs to do more than just expand coalition initiatives. However, it seems that this government just wants to take the easy option and that is costing Aboriginal students the right to a better life.

Many Aboriginal men and women have worked long and hard to gain experience in managing all aspects of the live cattle trade industry. Jobs have not just been lost in droving the herds onto boats. There are also bookkeepers, jackaroos and jillaroos, farm managers and drovers. And many of those workers are Aboriginal people, who through the benefits provided by the coalition government, have re-engaged with the need for better education and worked their way into good jobs—only to have them suspended in another misled decision by this government. And what is the government's solution to this suspension? They have banned the live cattle trade. They have sent all of these Aboriginal workers to Centrelink for compensation—the very place that many like to avoid.

I commend them for the work that they are doing. Students will experience traditional greetings and meet Aboriginal elders in the dreaming room. They will also learn traditional skills, history, Dreamtime legends, implement making and the Wiradjuri language. They will learn about scar trees, bush tucker and plant and animal usage.

The bill extends funding totalling $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments, including a number of Indigenous school programs.

We are supporting this bill because these were originally coalition initiatives.

Today there has been a lot of media focus on the fact that Australian children do well comparatively internationally in terms of life chances, with the exception in particular of Indigenous children. There is a growing gap, in fact, between the life chances and outcomes for Indigenous children—including both remote and metropolitan Indigenous children—compared to those for non-Indigenous young people in the Australian society. Quite obviously, that cannot be tolerated in a country like ours.

For example, with Indigenous adolescent incarceration, the rates of incarceration both for young men and women—teenage Aboriginal and

The levels of deafness and eyesight damage are just intolerable. In mainstream Australian society, a condition like otitis media, for example, is absolutely preventable or able to be cured in a way that does not leave permanent damage. But it too often leads to deafness in Aboriginal children before they reach their second birthday. There are implications of loss of hearing in terms of education, lifelong opportunities and even being able to participate in your home community. All of your chances are fewer if you have deafness and there is very little opportunity to get aids or even to learn signing to deal with it. This just should not be the case in Australia.

Compared to people in non-Indigenous Australia, Indigenous people who die from this sort of injury have more often been a vehicle passenger or a pedestrian. The risk factors are environment related, vehicle related and behaviour related and are different to those for the rest of the population.

Indigenous people are two to three times as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to have a transport related fatal injury and 30 per cent more likely to have a transport related serious injury. Seventy-five per cent of these injuries or deaths are in regional and remote areas. But even in urban locations Indigenous people have a two to three times higher rate of transport related fatal injuries. In some areas, the death rate may be 17 times greater than it is for the general population. This death rate occurs for all ages, including infants and children less than four years old, and there is a peak among 18- to 25-year-olds. The rate of 18 to 25-year-olds having accidents is a serious problem for non-Indigenous Australians too, but in the Indigenous community we have these young children and babies being killed as well. There are more likely to be single vehicle rollovers, and Indigenous people are 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous people to die as a pedestrian—35 per cent versus 13 per cent of all transport related fatalities respectively.

Why are Australian Indigenous people more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to die in cars—as drivers or passengers—or as pedestrians? The answers are not very hard to find. The conditions of outback roads are very bad. Often there is less maintenance available for vehicles. Often these vehicles are poorly maintained, damaged and unroadworthy. Most cars in remote communities develop mechanical problems within six months and last less than 2½ years.

With this bill targeting Indigenous education assistance, we are talking about more students having opportunities to be mobile, to move away to other places and to be involved in sports related programs. Some of those programs are very excellent indeed but, unless we also go to the nub of the problems associated with young people being killed in car accidents, we are not paying attention to the whole problem, with its complexities and its cultural differences.

They cannot get drivers licences. The nonsensical requirements now applying in most states and territories stipulating how many hours of pre-licence driving you do with a mentor or a parent in the vehicle just cannot apply in outback Australia. In Queensland you are supposed to have some 100 hours of pre-licence driving experience, but some islands in the Torres Strait, for example, might only have a couple of kilometres, if you are lucky, of main road. So how can a young Indigenous person from a Torres Strait island abide by the law and get their drivers licence lawfully with proper experience of driving during the day and night and in all sorts of conditions? They simply cannot. So they are set up to fail in terms of their own safety behind the wheel and also in terms of being law-abiding when it comes to being stopped by police and asked for their drivers licence. These young Indigenous people do not learn English because they are not at school long enough, because their attendance is poor or because the teaching of English at their school is inadequate. There is no special provision for that situation when it comes to these young people being given special driver education. Perhaps there should be a special drivers licence for people from remote areas. That would acknowledge the special problems associated with pre-licence driving experience by providing them with assistance from someone who has a licence.

They have come up with some suggestions on what to do to prevent Indigenous mortalities from road trauma. They suggest that there should be more school based education and post-licence education. They say there should be educational and social marketing—in other words, fear messages—in relation to these problems on the road.

Extending the funding for these programs is important but, I am sad to say, this is just a very small measure in terms of the huge task that confronts us. We have a lot of evidence that we are not doing any better in terms of how our Indigenous young Australians are experiencing life in our great country. I began by saying they are more likely to be locked up, homeless, have mental health problems, have alcohol and drug dependency problems, be assaulted and experience violence. They are more likely to be killed or seriously injured as a result of road trauma. The carers of those road trauma victims are more likely to have their own lives disadvantaged by the fact that they are caring for someone who is physically or brain injured—those with brain injuries may be damaged for life—and they are trying to deal with those things in a remote community.

We cannot go on having Indigenous Australians being out of sight and out of mind because of where they live. We need an integrated approach to what we do with the states and territories and non-government agencies. We need to collect a lot more data and monitor the outcomes of a program if it appears to be successful, because too often we do not properly monitor outcomes. The program has short-term funding. The staff who are working with that program become disenchanted when they are on a six-month or 12-month program lifecycle. And, if it succeeds, then maybe in five or 20 years time there will be another program echoing almost exactly the parameters of the first—reinventing the wheel. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities become despairing of a churn of people coming to assist them. They have no sense that there is any continuity of care or understanding of their issues and problems. And we go on having children in Australia who are more likely to be blind through, for example, the instance of cataract conditions; more likely to be deaf; more likely to have brain damage due to foetal alcohol syndrome; more likely to be incarcerated and more likely to suffer death and injury through road trauma—all in all, in every way not able to fully enjoy the opportunities of this great country of ours.

Both programs have achieved success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. The Sporting Chance Program was originally announced in the 2006-07 budget, with the objective of using sport and recreation as a tool to not only increase the level of educational participation of Indigenous students but also improve their final learning outcome. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program allows Indigenous youth aged between 16 and 24 to relocate from remote communities to gain qualifications to increase their chance of getting a good job. Indigenous youth from cities and regional towns are also eligible for the program if they relocate to another IYMP host location to gain qualifications or to take up an apprenticeship.

The achievements of the Clontarf Foundation are remarkable. With school attendance rates of 80 per cent, year-to-year retention of not less than 90 per cent and 75 per cent of graduates gaining full-time employment within one year of leaving school, something is right. Wouldn't it be great if, rather than needing to use the passion for football to educate our Indigenous people, we could instigate a passion for education at an early age. Indigenous teenage males have a life expectancy of 17 years less than non-Indigenous teenage males and are 28 times more likely to be imprisoned. They have a truancy rate of about 45 per cent and are more likely to leave school prematurely, some as young as nine.

I want the Indigenous people of Australia to be able to stand proud and say, 'That was what it used to be like,' when they get up on the podium of success and reflect on how much they have achieved.

Successful learning cannot be built on irregular attendance. There is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school the greater their success in learning.

Amazing! Whoever would have thought that would be the case! The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 is without doubt well intentioned; however, I do wonder, given this Labor government's love of rhetoric and lack of discipline in following through, whether any of the report's goals will ever be achieved.

This, so early on in the plan to halve the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students before 2018, is very troubling news. In what appears to be a distortion of the NAPLAN data, some believe assessments are actually being skewed to what is being taught rather than what children know.

But I note the report has not once mentioned the two words that are needed when dealing with Indigenous education: tough love. Instead, we have a report tarted up with socially and academically acceptable words so as not to offend anyone. Well, I think it is time that we offended people. I think it is time we set it straight and stopped pussyfooting around. For far too long Indigenous communities have existed rather than thrived, due to welfare handouts. We cannot educate the young before educating the educator.

That is not the case in Indigenous communities. The necessity of sending children to school needs to be embraced by the entire Indigenous population. An entrenched welfare philosophy exists within our Indigenous communities. Our passive love has not worked and will not ever work. We need more rigour. We need to impose welfare recipient restrictions in line with school attendance. We need to make full welfare payments dependent upon full school attendance.

It is all very well to spruik enrolment figures, but these figures are generally much higher than the true attendance rate and skew the picture completely. Exceptional headmasters and teachers and strong parental involvement can break the pattern, but school attendance in Aboriginal communities generally is far below that of the rest of the community. There is a culture of non-attendance because of funerals, extended absence for numerous reasons, overcrowding, housing, revolting abuse, sleep deprivation, lack of motivation through lack of purpose, lack of role models, no appreciation of need and no parental insistence.

First and foremost, we are all Australians; we are not Indigenous or non-Indigenous. We must stop the inequality of expectation between black and white. We need to change our mindset. We need to expect the same of all children, regardless of their colour or cultural background. By lowering our expectations for one sector of society, we do not allow them choices in life that other sectors take for granted—choices such as education, employment, success and, above all, hope. We can keep throwing money at communities with no real expectation of anyone improving their lives—it has worked for decades. Sure, we all feel better—out of sight, out of mind. We have done our bit, given money, eased our conscience, got to sleep nights and moved on—moved on until a hungry young reporter or a seasoned photographer pricks our conscience with a story about the trouble in our Indigenous communities.

Because the do-gooders of this country have brought a race to its knees, it is time to show tough love in order to restore dignity to our Indigenous people. All people need to have an education. As was pointed out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-2014, there is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school, the greater their success in learning.

Prior to the 2007 federal election, Labor promised it would contribute funds towards the construction and operation of three new boarding colleges for Indigenous secondary school students in years 8 to 12 in the Northern Territory. In 2008-09 the federal budget provided $28.9 million over four years towards this project—$18.8 million was to be spent in 2008-09 and $5.1 million, $2.5 million and $2.5 million over the following three financial years to 2011-12—with the Indigenous Land Corporation to contribute a further $15 million towards construction costs. So far, construction has begun on one site, and that has progressed to formwork only. Nearly three years after the specific commitment made by Mr Rudd, only one of the promised 38 Indigenous children and family centres will have been opened by 30 June this year.

The inquiry showed that not only are Indigenous youth 28 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous youth, but if you are an Indigenous woman you are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse than a non-Indigenous woman. Those figures are atrocious, yet the Greens have the audacity to demonstrate their ignorance by introducing to parliament bills condemning the intervention on the basis of human rights. Basic human rights, proclaimed and agreed upon, say that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind—such as those of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. These rights recognise that a child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment—in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. A child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in society. To deny children an education is to deny them basic human rights. So long as we continue to accept a culture that says, 'We will pay welfare with no expectation of something in return'—that is, the right of children to be educated—we are denying those children their natural human rights.

Through the act, the Australian government funds a range of programs to support the attendance, engagement and learning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will take the opportunity to provide a few examples of the kinds of programs that are funded under this act and draw the attention of members opposite in particular to those programs.

I consider as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth that personalised learning plans are an essential component of the education provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will be looking to work very closely with state jurisdictions as we continue to roll out this program.

I had the opportunity last week ,when we had a community cabinet in Darwin, to visit Casuarina Senior College, which is funded under this program and currently in its third year of that program. The school now has its largest ever cohort of Aboriginal boys undertaking year 12. That is a significant achievement and something that Casuarina Senior College and its students can be very proud of. It represents a quantum increase in the number of boys getting to year 12 and, once in year 12, having the opportunity to go on to further education, or to skills and vocation.

This helps new teachers understand community needs and expectations. It builds a solid and productive working relationship with community leaders, which can be very useful in resolving attendance and a range of other issues that can arise from time to time. These are just a few examples of the programs that are funded under the act and which members need to be very aware of. The fact is that funding provided under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act is not the only way this government is supporting better results, better outcomes, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Under the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, the government is providing some $2.5 billion to expand literacy and numeracy programs and to improve teacher quality, specifically in schools serving the most disadvantaged around the country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, like all students around the country, are benefiting from this significant investment, as well as from the investments that we are making in modernising school infrastructure, in providing technology for classrooms, in a high-quality Australian curriculum, in professional standards and improved training for teachers, in meaningful vocational training opportunities that students can still access while in secondary school and, again, in the provision of trade training centres, including those in the

That is the salient fact as we look at the resources that are being applied to make sure that every child, regardless of where they live, gets a great education. And the fact is that this government has set ambitious targets to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students, to lift our efforts to meet the enormity of that challenge. We know that, within the aim of closing the gap, that task is a really urgent one.

But what the member for Sturt failed to mention—it is always important to look at what he does not say as much as what he does—was that the COAG Reform Council reported that the work to collect those datasets is well advanced and will be in place for future years. So I caution the member for Sturt, when he comes into this House, not to make misleading use of statements and commentary by institutions such as the COAG Reform Council.

The member for Sturt failed to mention that it was the previous coalition government's policies that left an unacceptable number of young Australians without access to early childhood learning. So, when we came to government, we were faced with this deficit of policy, resources and support to enable young Australians, including young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, to get the best start in life that they can. So we started the massive task of improving service delivery and data collection, coming off a very inadequate base—the inadequate base that was the legacy of the Howard years—and when we finish, every child, no matter where they live in Australia, will have access to a quality preschool program delivered by qualified early learning teachers and access to the education resources that they need to make the best of their education journey.

Additionally, I should make mention of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed through COAG, signed off by first ministers and chief ministers, which binds both the Commonwealth and state jurisdictions to specific, on-ground, targeted actions to make sure that our efforts in Indigenous education continue unabated. Of course, as members know, all aspects of school funding are currently under review, with the new funding model for schools to be put in place from 2013.

I too agree that attendance is a key and important issue in education for Indigenous kids, and we want to especially work closely with education authorities and school systems to make sure that attendance is given the priority that it both needs and deserves—and I will have more to say about that in the coming months. To summarise, the bill provides clarity that the Indigenous education funds under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act that the Australian government uses to support Indigenous school students will continue at least up until the new system comes into place and that there will be time for proper planning and consultation regarding any changes that might arise as a result of the review.

There are issues of education and the fact that we have so many Indigenous Australians who are simply not attending school. There are also issues around housing, employment and economic opportunity.

The government is very focused on spending money but it is not particularly focused on the outcomes that are being delivered. It is my view that we must monitor very carefully and closely the outcomes of all programs and analyse the results so that successful programs can be expanded and those that are not successful can be modified or, in some cases, discontinued if they prove not to be worthy.

In doing so, he has challenged the philosophical orthodoxy on which a lot of the programs and government solutions to date have been based. I want specifically to look at education and the school attendance rate for Indigenous children. We know, looking at the figures, that on average attendance is less than 60 per cent and in remote communities it reaches barely 50 per cent. These children are being left behind.

Recommendation 16—and I do not propose to read all of it—specifically focuses on the importance of flying an Aboriginal and/or a Torres Strait Islander flag alongside the Australian flag within school grounds; learning about Indigenous sites of significance in the local area; incorporating an acknowledgement of country at the start of significant events as well as school assemblies; using local Indigenous language names for school classrooms or sporting houses and teams; celebrating Mabo Day,

But what it does not talk about specifically is increasing what are, in my view, core skills of numeracy and literacy and equipping students today with the skills they are going to need to be fully engaged in realising the economic opportunities that are available to them as members of the broader Australian community. I think that this is a significant problem. While the other recommendations I refer to may be very worthy, they are not going to make a significant difference to the educational experiences and outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I think we need to be a lot stronger. Parents need to send their children to school or face income penalties. We know already that many parents are not prosecuted when in fact they do not send their children to school.

He has talked in particular about educational scholarships for students to be educated, sometimes outside the community. The results with those programs and educational scholarships have been quite outstanding, and I think we need to very seriously consider whether this is something that the government should be looking very closely at.

We need to look carefully at the way in which schools and education policy interact with broader employment and economic policy and with the health initiatives that are being put forward as well as at the support we provide to families in Indigenous communities. We all want Indigenous children and Indigenous people in this country to be equipped to participate fully in the many opportunities a country like ours has to offer.

We will also continue to provide support to parents to get children to school and work with families and communities to remove hurdles that prevent school attendance.

Sadly, Indigenous juveniles are 28 times more likely than non-Indigenous juveniles to be incarcerated, despite Indigenous peoples representing only 2.5 per cent of the Australian population. This is a state of affairs that I think requires the urgent attention of all governments, communities and people across this nation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </p>

It is clear from the committee's investigation that there is intergenerational dysfunction in some Indigenous communities that presents a truly significant challenge of breaking that cycle of offending, recidivism and incarceration.

So I want to focus specifically on where we as a nation, sadly, sit in terms of these contacts and incarcerations. Secondly, I want to generally touch on some of those contributing factors and some of my own experiences in the field and then, finally, to talk about one local program in my area that I think is representative of the sorts of activities that can make a difference.

So this year, at the time of this report we are debating, we are 20 years down the track since that point in time. The committee drew together research and statistics gathered from state and national authorities. I want to indicate some of these to the House. I think they speak for themselves. Sometimes statistics can be a way of hiding the truth, as many have quoted the famous quote: 'Lies, damned lies and statistics.' However, I think in this case they actually illuminate for us very clearly the issue that we are dealing with.

That is 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles. In 2007 Indigenous juveniles accounted for 59 per cent of the total juvenile detention population, despite Indigenous people being 2.5 per cent of the total population. There is clearly a strong link between the disproportionate rate of juvenile detention and the disproportionate rate of adult imprisonment. Not surprisingly, if many of those adults being imprisoned are from Indigenous families then the flow-on impact on the children of those families sees an increase in their contact with the system and incarceration as well. At this time 25 per cent of all prisoners in Australia are Indigenous despite, as I said, being 2.5 per cent of the population.

When we comprehend how significant Indigenous women are to the fabric of Indigenous communities and to holding families together, from the increasing level of incarceration of those leaders in families and communities we can see why there are dysfunctional families with intergenerational problems and incarceration becoming a serious issue. Between 2000 and 2009 the imprisonment rate of

So the first point of contact is a place at which an important intervention can occur. In 2008 over 40 per cent of all Indigenous men in Australia reported having been formally charged with an offence by police before they reached the age of 25. That is 40 per cent of all Indigenous men.

Indigenous juveniles make up 53 per cent of all juveniles in detention and 39 per cent of all juveniles under community supervision. Importantly, they are younger than the average of those in the system. Twenty-two per cent of Indigenous juveniles in detention were aged 14 or younger, compared with only 14 per cent of non-Indigenous juveniles.

It is also, sadly, the fact that they are more often than not victims of crime as well. In particular, they are more likely to be victims of violent crime than non-Indigenous people. The impact of that on communities is important to recognise.

When we think of the impact of that on families and young people and the direct link between violence in families and engagement with the criminal justice system, we can see why there is such a problem. The committee acknowledged in its report that Indigenous victimisation rates are an important part of the problem that need to be addressed.

[and] the most significant contributing factor is the disadvantaged and unequal position in which Aboriginal people find themselves in society - socially, economically and culturally.

They include the broad categories of social norms and individual family dysfunction, which I have touched on to some extent, and connection to community and culture. There are some very moving stories in the report which were told by Indigenous elders, who talk about their young generation being caught between two worlds. It is not that they are connected to one and not the other; it is not that they are connected to the traditional culture and are therefore not able to participate in modern society or that they are connected to modern society and have lost their traditional culture. Rather it is that they are lost between the two, which is the worst possible circumstance you could imagine for them.

In particular, it discusses the issues around drug and alcohol abuse. It not only discusses drug and alcohol abuse in the environments in which young people are present but also discusses abuse by young people themselves and the impact it has on bringing them into the justice system. The education issues are talked about—the challenges not only of keeping young people in general engaged but also and in particular the challenges of keeping Indigenous young people engaged, and the member for Higgins talked about some of those. The employment link is discussed—getting through education and getting a job is also an important indicator and more of a challenge for our Indigenous young people than it is for our non-Indigenous young people. Accommodation is also discussed—the challenges around providing safe and secure housing and a permanent and ongoing address and how significant that is for young people. I recommend that all members of our communities have a look at both those aspects of the report in some detail and the very important recommendations that are made in the report.

Included in recommendation 23 is a suggestion for, 'Incentives to increase the employment of Indigenous police men and women and opportunities for mentoring and police work experience for Indigenous students.' I think that would be a very worthwhile initiative. One of the saddest comments I ever heard when I worked for juvenile justice was from a young Indigenous man who was in detention. He was completing his schooling—he was 17—and was engaged in some volunteer work for local emergency services. He said that the worst thing in his life that he could imagine was being released from detention and being sent back to his family and community. He knew that that the dysfunction there was such that it would be very hard for him to resist falling back into the old ways that had got him into trouble in the first place; it would also mean that it would be unlikely that he could continue with either his education or his potential employment opportunities, which were occurring because of his engagement in volunteering activity. I thought that was this saddest thing that I had ever heard—that a young person could say to me with years of experience under his belt that he was better off in detention than he would have been in the community, and I think that that remains a challenge for us.

It is creating a much stronger relationship between those services and the local Indigenous community, and in the class of 2009 there were 12 students—three with the Wollongong police, three with Lake Illawarra police, two with Nowra police, three with the New South Wales ambulance service and one with the state emergency service. That is the current cohort, which is going through to completion now. Overall, it is a really good program which has multiple benefits: it is well regarded by the community, it is a great asset to the broader community and it increases the capacity for young people to be connected. I understand that one of the young people is at the police academy completing the degree, continuing their enrolment and engagement with the police service. That is a good local story, but a small one. We all need to be focused on doing far more to address the issues that have been raised in this very important report.

Firstly, all children attended school regularly. There was much less mobility of parents in those days. The second thing that is important to note is that the greatest majority of the male heads of households—and please do not pull me up for being sexist; in those days, it was the male of the household who went out to work and put bread on the table—were gainfully employed, receiving a weekly wage and providing for their families.

In this place, we have been discussing sporting and other programs that are funded to encourage Indigenous male youth specifically to attend school on a regular basis. I am speaking about the Clontarf program, which is now spreading across Australia, having emerged from the Clontarf Aboriginal Hostel in Perth,

There is no doubt that it is instructive for emerging families today that there will be a circle of experience as an Indigenous person growing up, maturing, having a family and passing on in today's Australian society. Sadly, that circle is generally welfare dependent. It involves youth with the judicial system, then corrective services, then welfare, then the judiciary and then corrective services.

And it is a problem. You cannot ignore the fact that Indigenous people represent 2.5 per cent of the Australian population and the statistic that, of incarcerated Australian youth, 53 per cent are Indigenous. That is a statistic that you cannot find anything but horrendous and unacceptable.

We have made 40 recommendations, and I would be a liar if I were to stand here and suggest (a) that the 40 recommendations will be adopted and (b) that, should they be adopted, the problem would go away. It is irrational to suggest that. The problem has been entrenched for far too long. But there is no doubt in my mind that the major cause of the problem—that is, revolving door incarceration—is lack of education on the one hand and the present societal acceptance that education will not be absolutely necessary for Indigenous youth.

Indigenous kids have every right to education, as much right as mainstream kids. There is no difference in their intellect and there ought to be no difference in their treatment, yet we excuse the lack of school attendance by Indigenous kids. We turn a blind eye. We speak to state governments about the employment of truancy officers to make sure that Aboriginal families know that their children are not attending school and that something must be done about it because the cultural expectation is that children will go to school, and state government education ministers say, 'Well, there's nothing we can do about it.'

We ought to tie welfare payments to school attendance. I further believe that to not do so, and therefore to excuse Indigenous families from the responsibility of making sure their children attend school, if you analyse it and extrapolate, is certainly a denial of the human rights of those children. It could almost be compared with genocide, because we are guilty as parliamentarians if we do not enact laws that create outcomes for Australian citizens. We are contributing to an ongoing sin, and that is the denial of Indigenous children's rights. Everyone has a right to an education in this country, but if you are Indigenous we do not insist that you attend an institution. If you are mainstream, we do. Parents who do not send their children to an educational institution are brought to account. But if you are an Indigenous parent there would appear to be very active ignorance. We do not even expect it.

They're just Indigenous people.' I think that is horrendous—totally unacceptable. There is no reason why we should not apply the same rigour in our requirements at law to Indigenous people as we do to mainstream society, and part of that requirement is to send kids to school. It is a parental responsibility and it is accepted generally at law that it is a parental responsibility—unless you are an Indigenous parent, it seems. Then we turn the blind eye.

We need to work on a policy and even, dare I say, ignore political correctness. We have already done so much damage to the Indigenous population, their expectations and their role as part of mainstream Australian society. We have already done so much damage. Well-intentioned decisions resulted in the denial of opportunity, because we denied our responsibility of insisting that Indigenous families maintain the same culture as mainstream families and accept education as the norm. I can tell my colleagues here in this place that school attendance in Indigenous remote communities is not the norm; it is far from the norm. And it is accepted by all and sundry as being okay, because, 'Well, the parents had to drive 2,000 kilometres to attend a funeral and they were going to go for a week but they stayed for three months, and that is okay because it is culturally appropriate.' I do not accept that children should be denied their human rights on the basis of our current interpretation of what is culturally correct.

It looks to me as though this is perhaps not the actual situation, but I can assure you that agency after agency will say, 'We have got a program. We have got a bucket of money and we are moving amongst Indigenous communities and we are looking for groups to take up this funding. So, would you, or you or you perhaps take this funding responsibility on and deliver for your community, because it is going to have a very positive outcome.' People are almost coerced, as Indigenous individuals, into participation in programs that have been well-meaningly funded by governments of all kind. But at the end of the day there is very little expectation, and almost no audit, that the outcomes achieved by that funding will be positive. After the expenditure of the funding somebody says, 'Well, that provided employment for a period of time and circulated taxpayer funding for a period of time and therefore it must have had a positive outcome.' Well, it is not the case. My experience clearly indicates that this effectively creates a privileged position for those who are directly involved in the particular program, but in the rest of the community it creates a degree of jealousy. Then, when everyone observes that the program has achieved no positive outcome, the rest of the community in the future is not reticent when putting their hand up for a government funded program, so that they, too, can be part of it. And because they believe there will be no requirement for rigour and no actual audit, and no-one will be criticised if there is no positive outcome.

We are all very quick to criticise the paternalism of the mission education system and how teaching with an iron rod is not acceptable these days, but the individuals who were educated at Mogumber,

There was direct connectivity between school attendance and learning, the expectation and the welfare that was provided by the mission.

In these closing seconds, let me implore my colleagues on both sides of the House: something needs to be done. The stats are all there. The knowledge has been collected. We know that what has happened in the past is not solving the problem. Fifty-three per cent of the juvenile prison population are Indigenous, although they make up just 2.5 per cent of the general population. The worst possible result of this report would be that we once again do nothing.

The impact of having such a high number of Indigenous youth in our criminal justice system has implications that are far and wide: implications for the family unit, for the broader community and for levels of school attendance—which in remote communities are less than 50 per cent—and, personally, for their subsequent employment chances and for the likelihood of their escaping the negative influences of substance and narcotic abuse.

We need to get the kids more engaged. We need to work with families. We need to create employment opportunities. We need to end the substance and narcotic abuse. We need an integrated, intergovernmental approach.

Those 40 recommendations contain some very important suggestions, including better funding for local mentoring programs and improving recreational and sport related activities, because such programs will offer Indigenous youth a better life and a better lifestyle; more gender appropriate accommodation for Indigenous youth, particularly housing plans that ensure they are better equipped when they leave detention; better funding for programs to deal with substance and narcotic abuse; and greater focus on mental health programs. Interestingly, the report recommends hearing tests for all children starting in preschool and training of police so they are more aware that the young people they encounter may have hearing loss. It also recommends incentives for school attendance, including breakfast and lunch programs. If we can get them to school, we offer them an alternative lifestyle to one spent in the prison system. Another recommendation is for teacher development programs to enable our teachers to recognise poor health in their students and to have a greater cultural awareness. This will help them engage with students who may have poor English language skills.

Norforce is a good example for many Indigenous youth, with their communities playing a vital role in the protection of our nation. Increasing employment opportunities for Indigenous men and women in the police force is another recommendation. Then there is the recommendation to establish and fund a national Indigenous interpreter service.

They need to look into the use of diversionary options to determine whether there are alternative sentencing options other than incarceration for Indigenous youth. Critically, we have to examine the rehabilitation process. This report suggests assigning community service case workers, providing better counselling for substance and alcohol abuse and engaging the families of those who find their way into our criminal justice system.

In this speech, she told her audience, including the then Prime Minister, that she was the only student in her primary school class who went on to be successful. She was the only girl not to have a child at the age of 15 or before. She was one of only three children in her class not to become an alcoholic. Seven of her classmates had been in prison. Four had tragically committed suicide. She went on to get an education, including a university degree, and forged a new path for herself. If we get more Indigenous youth to school, if we lift the year 12 retention rates from around the 35 per cent or 36 per cent that they are today, if we get systematic help for those Indigenous youth in our prison system then we can have more achieve as she has done.

We need to be innovative. We need to focus, as Noel Pearson and others have talked about, on the issue of personal responsibility. But we cannot leave people behind if they cannot help themselves. If Australians want to know what the true moral challenge for our time is it is Indigenous disadvantage and particularly, as we have learned from this report, the disproportionate and tragic numbers of Indigenous youth who are incarcerated in our jails today.

It is a tragedy that we still have to have a report that has to delve into these particular issues of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system in Australia. It highlights the appalling overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in detention right around this great country of ours. While

One of my assistants in Queensland at the time worked on that particular report. The devastating stories that she would tell me haunt me to this day. It was her role to assist the commissioner in obtaining evidence. It is sad that we are here 20 years later and we still have this incredible rise in Indigenous youth in detention despite the work of numerous government agencies, hundreds of community organisations, community elders and many other active volunteers.

He has a large number of Indigenous people in his electorate. We really need to do a lot more here. Education is where it really needs to start.

I had a retail seafood business, and I recognised some outstanding qualities in our assistant manager, who was of Indigenous background. I decided that I would work with her to be the best assistant manager that she could possibly be. But you have to take a holistic approach. There were issues of lack of good nutrition and work standards that we addressed. I think that was probably one of my greatest failings as an employer. While we worked very, very hard to get consistent attendance at work and we worked on some of the social aspects that were affecting her life as well as the nutritional aspects and also the lack of educational opportunities that she had had earlier, I am sad to say that I failed in my quest because it was beyond me. As much as one can help in all of those areas, there are some cultural issues that are stumbling blocks, and we need to address those. They are stopping business people from achieving their best potential. One of my greatest regrets is that we could not go any further there and I sincerely wish her the very best in whatever she endeavours to do in her life. But literacy was clearly an issue with my assistant manager. Whilst literacy issues are higher in Indigenous populations, they will not allow Indigenous people to go on to further education and to be skilled in the best possible way. We need to really work on that.

It presents a whole range of problems for Indigenous youth in Australia. The report highlights the sad fact that Indigenous kids are more likely to come into contact with the police and the criminal justice system than non-Indigenous kids. Once you get into that terrible cycle it is hard to break, and it is a self-fulfilling cycle. The report identified a link between the overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system and social factors. We have to look at these much more seriously. We have to look at educational levels, as I mentioned just earlier. We have to look at levels of alcohol and drug use, hearing loss and all of those self-esteem issues as well. The combination of all of those things in Indigenous youth has led to the outcome of this particular report.

I note particularly that there is a lack of a holistic approach. Just as I tried to take a holistic approach in my workplace, I think we need to do that. We need to have better pathways for Indigenous people out there in the community. We have to take an absolutely holistic approach if we are to address these issues. The 40 recommendations outline a very clear strategy for improving positive social norms. They look at things like improving education and addressing employment, health issues and housing. The report also outlined the need for improvement in government policy on police education and training. We need to have more Indigenous police officers. I welcome the fact that state governments have increased the number of Indigenous officers, and we in Queensland have led the way there as well.

They want a good job. They want to feel great about themselves. They want to spend money on things that they see on

Many speakers before me have highlighted this tragedy and many, many millions of dollars have been spent to tackle the problem, and yet the rate of incarceration continues to rise. There appears to be a lot of short-term funding. I am not knocking some of the programs—they are very good programs—but sometimes they do not get to fully achieve their aims because they are such short-term programs.

I want to take this opportunity to highlight one program that has very clear goals and aims. I want to commend Project 10%, which was launched last month in my electorate of Brisbane. Unfortunately, due to parliamentary commitments in Canberra I was not able to be there, but I really follow the project with interest. While Project 10% was officially launched last month, it is the result of many years of hard work and many dedicated volunteers.

I commend upfront the chair of the committee, Senator Dana Wortley, and the deputy chair, Mr Alex Hawke, the member for Mitchell, for the great work that they and the entire committee did. This report shows us in no uncertain terms what most of us already know, which is that much more needs to be done to address online safety for children in Australia. It was quite scary hearing some of the submissions. The internet offers great opportunities for our young people, through new technologies and greater connection. The internet came into my life when I was an educator, a teacher, and it was a wonderful learning opportunity for a schoolteacher to be able to access online rather than hard-copy resources. I left teaching to become a lawyer and, going back to classrooms now as a member of parliament, I see a completely different experience, because the internet is obviously in everybody's home—and with the rollout of the

Maybe the many things we have done to cultivate older people having connections to the internet are good, but there is then the capacity for them to strike up a friendship with a friendly young man from Nigeria or the like. But the focus of this inquiry was young people. Anybody who has young kids knows how tech-savvy they can be. I have a six-year-old and a two-year-old. The two-year-old is not quite computer-savvy but, my goodness, the six-year-old is incredible. I am no particular technophile, but I have seen the problems that can develop when he is on a free game site. I get recommendations from people whom I trust and who understand the internet about games he can play, and even with these games the ads that pop up are easy and tempting to click on for someone whose morality is not fully developed—and I think morality is fully developed for men at about 30. For some, it takes a little longer! I can see how tempting it is for young people—particularly young men, I would suggest—to make the foolish decision to click on something on the screen, when who knows what could happen.

Much of what we learned during this inquiry we learned directly from the experiences of young Australians. As much as the committee appreciated the submissions of the other stakeholders that we heard from, hearing from the young people was particularly useful. They told us how they used the technology, which was scary, their awareness of the risks and also, thankfully, what they do to keep safe. Obviously, young people do make crazy decisions, but the crazy things that I did as a 10-year-old are long forgotten by everyone except me and maybe my brothers and sisters. What can happen now for a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old or a 15-year-old is that they lay mines that will explode much later in their life—the photograph, the blog or the comment that can go around the world. In the prism of parliamentary life we can see that we have to watch what we say—that maybe we should not slip on a tutu or a set of fishnet stockings when we are out, because it could haunt us for the rest of our life. But the reality is that young people tweet and blog and put things on Facebook, and do not realise that they are laying mines that will explode for them much later on.

Many of the committee's recommendations came from the information that those people provided. The committee travelled to MacGregor State School, which is a very large school in my electorate and is one of the best schools in Queensland. Its year 7 students were actually one of the first to take part in an online survey. I thank the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth,

The survey got a lot of media attention in my electorate. All the students, particularly Carmen Zhu, Jason Tang, Linh-Dan Pham and Matthew Borka, were incredibly forthright. I particularly mention Matthew Borka, one of the school captains. He is a slight young man with glasses, who talked about his cyber-bullying experience. He is very switched on. I think it is easier to be elected to the federal parliament than it is to become a school captain at McGregor State School. They have this whole interview and speechmaking process. His platform was basically about combating bullying, both cyber-bullying and physical bullying, so it was a perfect school for us to attend and hear his experience. In an article in the

The recommendations include simple things like coming up with an agreed definition of cyber-bullying and having a cyber-safety student mentoring program, so that those who understand the internet a bit better or have good computers at home are able to educate those who do not.

Even small businesses in my electorate do this. It is important that we make sure that information transferred overseas is protected in a manner that is at least equivalent to that provided for under Australia's privacy framework. I am reasonably happy with the Australian legislation but I am obviously not too sure what goes on in Mumbai and other places.

We need to work with the teachers, the education ministers and the states to make sure that we have a core understanding of what we need to do to make our schools safe and to come up with some acceptable use agreements so that rather than all 9,800 schools having to reinvent the wheel we can say, 'These are the core things that every student in every school should be able to accept as acceptable use.'

There are a lot of mature age students coming in. They bring life skills, but do not necessarily bring the internet and cyberworld skills that we need. So we need to ensure that all Australian universities that provide teacher training courses ensure that cyber safety material is incorporated into the core units in their curricula—not done as a standalone unit but embedded into the process.

Obviously, these recommendations will go some way to making things safer. But the obvious fact is that safety starts at home. Schools and legislation and informed teachers all help but it is obviously at home where we can best educate our children about the dangers. Even if we are not a techno savvy person, we can still educate our children about commonsense approaches to the dangers. In closing, I want to again thank the committee chair, Senator Dana Wortley, for her efforts in driving this inquiry. I wish her well in her future endeavours, whatever they might be. I commend this report to the House.

I am pleased that within the report there is acknowledgement of the need to engage with people at a very young age. This is really important. They need to be aware and alert. They are engaged with the internet at a very young age. They are, as we know, very savvy in this world. Not only that, they are very keen at a very young age to engage. But in doing so we have to make sure that they are aware, alert and protected. A lot of what is in this report reflects that intent, with some practical measures suggested to assist in that.

We need to learn how they manage their issues and how they see things. That is a key part of why the recommendations out of this report will be useful and valuable, because young people have said, 'This is what we need; this is the world we're in.' I hope that the minister does respond to that, because the young people have said what they need and how they need things done. That engagement with young people is very important. I have a youth reference group that I meet on regular occasions. Interestingly, this year cybersafety was highlighted as one of the most important issues these young people are facing. Admittedly, this is an older age group, covering years 10 through 12. They raised really serious issues with me about online safety and even about being comfortable online. The use of social media sites is as much a threat to them and a challenge for them to deal with as it is an opportunity to engage and to be part of what young people do.

The young people made me very aware of some of the Facebook issues, such as 'sexting', when we were having our discussion. Given their exposure to online scams and self-harm websites and the fact that they could be drawn into engaging with these sorts of websites and the behaviour that goes with that, they were very keen that education should start very young.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               One thing that really concerned me was that cyberbullying happens 24 hours a day, seven days a week for some of our young people. That in itself is a major challenge. Those of us who were perhaps subjected to physical bullying were able to get away from it. However, a young person can become the target of cyberbullying that is then circulated to others. It is like a pack dog mentality whereby everybody gets involved and picks on that young person. It can create major social and emotional problems for that young person. Those who are picked on—to put it bluntly—in physical life can be the same young people who are very susceptible to being bullied online as well. They are quite vulnerable.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The young people told me that they were often concerned about talking to an adult about the fact that they were being bullied on the cyberscene. Whether it was their mobile phone with internet connection, their own computer or access to the internet at home, they did not want to lose that connection. One of the barriers to these young people getting the help they needed was the fact that they were often too scared to tell their mum or dad because they did not want to lose access. They were worried that that was how their mum and dad would react—that they would say, 'If that's what happening to you online then you just can't use it.' And of course it is so important to them for so many reasons, so often they do not engage with their parents or others in authority when this happens.

I think it would be fantastic if there were more younger people actually delivering cybersafety messages to other young people, telling them: 'This is what happens in your world. This is what we do online. This is us on Facebook. Here is our page, and this is what you can and can't or should and shouldn't be doing.' All of those things matter to young people. They actually want to know what they can and cannot do safely.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I went to one of my primary schools and asked the young people there how many were on Facebook. These are children under the age of 12. We know that they are supposed to be over 13 to be on Facebook, but 75 per cent of the young people in that class put their hands up. They were all on Facebook. I asked them, 'How old are you saying you are when you sign up to be on Facebook?' Some of them said 16, and some said 18. Those children would be in receipt of inappropriate content as a result of that. Also, they were not aware that Facebook owns the photos, the words and everything else they put on Facebook. I hate to say it, but just as so many men do not read the fine print—more men than women do not read the fine print—the situation is the same with young boys on Facebook. More of the young girls were aware that Facebook owned everything they put on that website, such as photos, but the young boys were not as aware. A lot of young people were not aware that, despite the fact that they had deleted something, that material was still out there and would be there forever.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I heard different stories about young people's experiences on Facebook. I even spoke to some parents who would take photos of their children in their school uniforms and put them on Facebook. Any mature age predator would then know exactly what school that young person was going to and where they could access them if they chose to. So there are a range of issues that we need to manage.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But it is not just the physical side, which is something that young people on Facebook do not understand. I asked one young school child how many friends they had on Facebook, and it was almost like a competition—I need to be the one with the most. But, in being the one with the most, the risk is greater. I asked them, 'Do you actually know all these people?' 'Yes,' they replied, 'because they are my friends.' I asked, 'Do you know whether it is a 60 year-old person or a person of your own age?' The answer was that, no, they did not know. These were the simple things that a young person under the age of 12 was not necessarily aware of. Because they are young and innocent they assumed that everybody they accepted as a friend was indeed a friend and of the same age as them, which quite often they were not.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But it was not just that. I asked them, 'What do you talk about online with these 500 friends?' as one young person had. They replied, 'We talk about home and about mum and dad. We talk about when we are going on holidays. And we might talk about the fact that grandma cannot come and look after the house while we are away.' They would talk about when it was their birthday, when it was mum's or dad's birthday and who grandma was. Over a period of time these young people will be far more at risk of identity theft than they currently are, because collating the information they have in all innocence provided will give others an opportunity to steal their identity after they get their first credit card. Someone may collect enough information to change their password.

That is just on the Facebook side of things and perhaps on other social websites. But then there is the issue of using the internet for online banking or the myriad other things people might do online.

It is a major issue that has a very concerning impact on young people. At some stage, perhaps when they are at high school, they will have a special friendship with another young person that they may both believe is a very genuine relationship and they may send photos of parts of themselves to each other. But by one avenue or another those images can end up in the broader public arena, and that can do an incredible amount of damage. I had evidence from families of how it has destroyed young people and the value they place in themselves.

So these are the issues. The employer was also concerned that every other member of the staff had received the photo. For that young person, who probably in all innocence provided those photos to someone, they will be there forever.

I am hoping that the minister follows many of those. I encourage all of us in our roles in parliament to do our best out in the community to inform and educate young people and keep them aware and alert. I encourage members to read this report and think how you can do something like that for the people you meet. Again, I like the idea of young people engaging with other young people, because they will take so much more notice of that.

They want to be aware and alert but they want to use this medium and they are going to. Part of what we need to do with this report is give them the tools to be safe, aware and alert in a way that will carry through to mature age. When they start doing tax and banking online it could evolve into online security that is a lifetime commitment. That is equally as important. I was involved in a previous inquiry where we heard so many stories of mature-age people who were subject to various forms of online scams and attacks. Right throughout the community now, I would think that every member in this place is seeing constantly in the papers the latest report about a young person on a social website. It was brought up so often by these young people from high schools as being something that influenced how happy or not they were at school and how they could cope in their life simply through this cyberworld that they live in and the actual damage that could be done to them in an emotional and physical sense.

As I said, it is extremely relevant, and the engagement of young people is critical to the results that this report has delivered. I would, again, commend all of the committee who were so involved in it. I see this as an opportunity to help young people deal with the issues that they have. I commend the report, the chair, the deputy chair and everyone involved. I am hoping that this report will be the beginning of engaging young people in a direct sense in their own safety and in their own futures in whatever way they engage with the internet and that when they are online they are able to enjoy it and be safe and protected and can pass that knowledge onto others.

I say to these young people, 'Be prepared to ask your mates: are you okay? When you see them visibly upset when they receive a message—be it a computer message or other message—just ask them whether they are okay because quite often they are not and they just might need you to ask that question and encourage them to get support, whether it is from you or from someone else who can help but not someone that they would perhaps fear would take away the technology that is often their link to being mature, their link to the world and their link to engaging. That is all part of this report. I commend it to the House.

I was very pleased to be a part of this report because it allowed us to connect with a variety of different stakeholders and people involved in this area. It is not just young people who get caught up in some of these issues on the internet. In fact, what we did hear on the committee time and time again is that parents often have a fear of the unknown. When they do not know what is happening on the internet they can become quite worried and fearful. Part of the recommendations are looking at what we can do to empower young people to stay safe on the internet but also empower parents to feel that they are in control. There is a recommendation in the report for a self-assessment tool that allows people, whether they be parents or young people, to gauge exactly what they know and do not know.

They are so familiar with this technology and so comfortable with it that every now and again they do get caught out on some of the technicalities and localities and are less fearful about this. This was a very wide-ranging report. We as a committee did a survey. I think it is unique for House of

There were 60,000 comments received by the committee and over 7,000 responses directly from young people so that we could hear what they had to say. That was an important part of the committee's work. I must commend the chair, Senator Dana Wortley, and the deputy chair, the member for Mitchell. They worked very hard on this. The chair definitely took this up with a lot of passion and a lot of dedication. Hearing directly from young people was critically important.

One of the recommendations that has come out is, while a lot of great tools have come out on what to do about cyberbullying, to centralise that and have a portal through which people can directly access information about where to go and what to do. This is a really important recommendation.

A lot of young people spend most of their time at school and with teachers during the week. We need to look at training teachers on how to watch out for this issue and how to be involved in this issue. We do not want them to preach to young people because, as I have said, young people know a lot more than a lot of older people sometimes about how to navigate the internet. But we want to teach them how to support young people in the constructive use of the internet. We want to teach them how to intervene if there is a problem online. Teacher training and cultures within school environments are things that this report makes some very good recommendations about.

This is not just an issue concerning young people. A lot of people do not know what to expect when they go on to things like Facebook. While there is a lot of information out there, it is not always clear. One of the issues that I raised in the committee was the fact that privacy settings are made without notification. Privacy settings get changed and then suddenly your information has become available after you have set up that Facebook page doing everything that you could to protect your privacy. When a setting changes, you are not notified about it. Or, if you are notified, that notification is not very clear. When it comes to social networking sites, especially when offensive material is put up, there is room to improve things. While the government is somewhat restricted because this is an international issue, there are certainly regulations that we can look at to help ensure that people are safe.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But it is also about empowering young people, parents and teachers to protect themselves online. It is about helping them understand the gaps in their knowledge—things that they might not have thought about. For parents, it is about facing some of the unknowns, some of the things that they are not confident about and are concerned about.

As I have mentioned, there is a gap. This was certainly evident in the survey. There is sometimes a gap between generations in their understanding of the internet and what can be done. I certainly know that. When I go to schools I see young people on laptops in year 2 and year 3 doing their research on the internet—these children are six and seven—and those children are often a lot more savvy than I am. There is certainly a gap, so having that peer-to-peer discussion or education is also critically important.

I would like to thank all the members of the committee. I would also like to thank the secretariat, who worked very hard on this. I would like to thank all of the young people and others who gave evidence for their participation. It was greatly valued. It does provide a bit of a model for how committees can work in the future—going out and directly talking to young people or whichever different group is concerned. Directly consulting is a good idea. With 7,000 responses, this was of great interest, with young people really wanting to have their say. On that note, I commend the report to the House and thank everyone involved.

I did present the report some time ago in the House, but I was a little constrained in time when I did, so there are a number of things I want to briefly mention that I think are very relevant.

I think the senator has played a very good role and provided leadership in this committee. He certainly had a passion for ensuring that this committee did what it aimed to do from the outset, which was to make a difference. Whether it be in the delivery of this particular report or in other measures that have been subject to this committee's recommendations, such as unexplained wealth and measures which are designed to combat serious and organised crime, I praise the efforts of Senator Hutchins. I would also like to put on record that, under his chairmanship, not once was a minority report delivered by this committee. It has been a truly bipartisan approach to law enforcement, and I think that is one of the virtues that he has been able to bring to bear as chair of the committee. Hopefully, in that respect I can continue in that role as I now take over as Chair of the Parliamentary

I know a lot of people still take the view that is a game of cops and robbers, but modern-day criminal enterprise is certainly no game in terms of the people involved or the enterprises they undertake. One thing that is clear—and I think this is the modern thinking of law enforcement—is that it is an enterprise; it is a business. It is a nefarious business but nevertheless a business. It is a business that has a profit motive. As a matter of fact, the cost of this business to the Australian community, of the damage and everything else that it inflicts on the Australian community, is something like $15 billion annually, so it is quite substantial. I regard criminal enterprise as a business, one with a profit motive, but to address that we need to undermine the profit motive and the business model of that particular enterprise. We need to actually work with our law enforcement agencies to prevent, to disrupt and, where a crime is committed, to apprehend. But is in respect of prevention and disruption that I would like to briefly speak about.

They are organisations that are extraordinary in various ways. Certainly, they both have extraordinary powers—the Australian Crime Commission in particular. They have coercive powers to force the giving of evidence. One of the reasons we oversight these two bodies is because of those extraordinary powers. The exercising of these powers is an infringement of civil liberties, but the government and previous governments, in their wisdom, have been able to take a responsible attitude in balancing the liberties and safeguards of our communities.

The commissioner of police in each state and territory is on the board of the Australian Crime Commission. We are moving to ensure that there are not windows of opportunity for criminal enterprise to be able to play one state off against another. One thing that has become clear is that there is no point in looking at crime statistics for one state vis a vis another. Criminal enterprise and the criminals who run these enterprises do not go and look at the Constitution or at a map when deciding to plan their next endeavour. They will, however, look to loopholes in legislation—such as the ability of various agencies to do wire taps, telephone interceptions and things like that. Windows of opportunity will invite criminal elements to become involved and do significant damage to our communities.

Having one of these cards gives the holder significant access to restricted areas in our airports or our maritime ports. One of the things we have been able to identify is the amount of contraband that comes through our ports at the moment, and we think that both the ASIC and MSIC regimes need to be significantly strengthened.

Things have moved on from there. Whilst terrorism is always going to be significant to us and something we should never take for granted—we should never take our feet off the throats of those who could possibly be involved in those activities—significant damage is being done. And it is not just financial damage—the $15 billion I spoke about earlier; for every crime that is committed, there is a victim of crime.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Therefore, one of the things we strongly recommend is that, if there is compelling criminal intelligence that someone is involved in serious or organised crime, that should be a reason for withdrawing ASIC or MSIC cards and thereby withdrawing their access to aviation or maritime ports. We have attempted through the course of this report to ensure that we extend the good work that has flowed since September 11 in looking at the prevention of access to our ports and airports by people who may have an interest in a terrorist related endeavour. However, we think that, in view of airports and in particular seaports being the main point of entry for a lot of contraband, particularly illegal drugs and precursor chemicals, this is an area where not only do we need to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the powers they need to police those sectors effectively but the community should also be comforted in the knowledge that people who have access to and work in and about those facilities are not engaged, directly or indirectly, in criminal activity and, as a consequence, helping to facilitate the importation of drugs or other illicit material.

I understand that. As a matter of fact, many laws that we make in this place, in one way and another, affect one's freedoms. Given the dimensions of criminal enterprises and also the significant financial and physical harm that occurs as a consequence of these enterprises, we are certainly trying to move to address those issues to ensure that our police have the necessary backing so that they can do the job we require of them in protecting our community. In addition to that, we should be taking all steps possible to assure the community that the people associated with our wharves and our airports are of such a calibre that we have a reasonable expectation that they are not involved in criminal activity.

The report focused on early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide and covered two parliaments, those being the 42nd Parliament and the 43rd Parliament. I notice the member for Kingston is here in the chamber, who was on the committee during the 42ndParliament. It is regretful that she has left the committee and was not able to continue with her support on this particular inquiry. But I was very pleased when, in the 42nd Parliament, we decided to do this report, even though the Senate was also running a committee inquiry into suicide. As it states in the report:

It was also because I had met with parents who had experienced the loss of their children through suicide. As human beings we know that we are all going to have to deal with the loss of loved ones at some stage, whether it be through natural causes, accidents or suicide. Our communities have to deal with the effects of suicide, and that does provide many challenges for families, friends and schools, and those effects can be very damaging in more ways than the experience of grief. We could see that in the evidence we took, with cluster suicides now, unfortunately, becoming more common.

I also spoke about the fact that as a nation we provide many millions of dollars to prevent road accidents and deaths in the workplace; I hope that this report will encourage our nation to provide and support early intervention programs that will reduce the number of suicides, whether they be youth or older people who take this step for many different reasons. Figures show that, in 2004, 500 more Australians committed suicide than died in road accidents in Australia.

I restate that the level of concern about the statistics on youth suicide is due to the fact that the statistics are not nationalised, with many states keep differing records, and this needs to be addressed. Statistics on suicide in Australia are available from a number of sources. National data on suicide is published in some years by the

The most recent data, published in 2007, contains summary statistics on deaths registered in 2005 where the cause of death was determined to be suicide. Even more recent, though less comprehensive, statistics on suicide in Australia are published annually in the ABS Causes of Death reports. The most recent report, released in 2011, provides information on suicides based on mortality data from 2009.

The committee understands that the lack of a nationwide, systematic approach limits the usefulness of suicide information. However, it is also evident that the problems associated with data collection on and the reporting of suicide, including youth suicide, are well recognised. In relation to this, the committee acknowledges that the ABS has already made significant efforts to implement reforms to improve the accuracy and quality of data on suicide and these processes are ongoing.

As noted earlier in this Chapter, registered suicides in this group are relatively uncommon, though for a range of reasons it is likely that the reported figures are an underestimate. While acutely aware of the difficulties of establishing suicidal intent in this age group, and the extreme sensitivity for the families concerned, the Committee is keen to support initiatives which ensure that suicide in this demographic is not ‘hidden’. The Committee believes that appropriate recognition of suicide in the under 15 year age group is needed to ensure that prevention initiatives do not neglect these children. The Committee notes that the Senate recommendation has been referred to the ABS.

That will assist in developing strategies to reduce suicide rates. A significant body of research already exists which indicates that many factors contribute to the likelihood that someone will consider or attempt suicide or not. These factors generally act to either increase the likelihood of suicide—risk factors—or decrease this likelihood—protective factors.

Access to accurate and comprehensive data and an improved understanding of the influence of risk and protective factors on young people are needed to support an improved understanding.

The committee understands that the main value of this information is to provide a good evidence base to inform the development and appropriate implementation of strategies for reducing rates of youth suicide and to enable effective evaluation of the impact of interventions.

I would like to mention that we in the coalition took a policy of early intervention to the last election. We committed to provide $440 million in funding towards 20 early psychosis intervention centres in major metropolitan and regional areas. These centres were to be based on the existing EPPIC model and were to provide comprehensive and targeted care for young Australians aged 15 to 24 years at clinical high risk and with first episode psychosis. The centres would have provided intensive interventions aimed at recovery and prevention of relapse. Four hundred million dollars was committed towards system design, service evaluation, workforce development, medical and allied health costs, case management, home and mobile care, and vocational recovery assistance provided by early psychosis intervention centres. Forty million dollars was to be provided towards additional capital costs of the centres.

One of the difficulties with early intervention is identifying individuals who need support and ensuring they get it. While noting that some have expressed reservations with the use of the term 'gatekeeper', in this context it is simply used to describe a diverse range of individuals who have regular contact with young people. These people include family, friends, teachers, youth workers, sports coaches, health professionals, law enforcement personnel and emergency services personnel. As noted in the submission from the

Importantly, the committee does not expect these groups to assume the role of counsellor. Rather, the committee considers that it would be useful for parents, peers and teachers to be trained to recognise the signs of mental distress and be equipped to start a conversation providing 'at risk' young people with advice on the resources that are available or putting them in contact with a specialist service.

I am sure that any teacher would be willing to have the gatekeeper training, even if it meant saving only one life during their career.

I thank them for their courage, as it made the committee's job easier. I see that the member for Robertson, who was on the committee, is in the chamber. I know that the evidence we took during that time was disturbing, but it was great to hear that the evidence that the young people gave was able to assist us in making the recommendations in this report. I thank everyone who was involved, particularly the secretariat and the chairman, the member for Hindmarsh. I commend the report to the House.

It is with sadness, but in a sense also with pride, that this work is being undertaken at this level with the intention of securing much better life outcomes for others on behalf of people who are now, sadly, on the record as having lost their life to the tragedy of suicide. As members of parliament moving around the community we hear these stories and we are very sensitive to the impact that they have on the members of our community.

They account for 20 per cent of all deaths. It is the second most common cause of death, after accidents, amongst young people. Tragically, the rate of death in young males is one in four, a much higher rate than suicide deaths amongst older men. Suicide rates for young females are also higher than they are for older females. They account for one in seven deaths where, for boys, it is one in four.

As a new member, this is the second report I have spoken to this week on important work which we completed, which was commenced in the 42nd Parliament. This report came up with 10 core recommendations. In terms of how they covered areas, this is essentially how I see it. The first two really talk about recording and reporting, and the member for Swan made considerable observations on that. We found as we were taking evidence that trying to get data in particular jurisdictions was quite difficult, and then to seek any comparability across jurisdictions was almost impossible. So this is an area that needs serious review and serious action. The third recommendation essentially dealt with research going forward.

What was really heartening was that, in each of these jurisdictions, people have responded—agencies have responded and government departments have responded—with a range of resources that they are using and implementing. The problem is that across jurisdictions—even within jurisdictions—some of those great resources are unknown to others. We also noticed that linkages between community education and other agencies was something that was not well constructed and needed further attention. I have mentioned the problems within jurisdictions. If you amplify that out across the nation, you can see that national coordination remains a problem as well.

I think this outlines the complexity of this issue. It is not one agency or one issue that can be attacked here. There is a whole-of-government response that is required in terms of dealing with a whole person. Those areas of cultural identity, employment status and educational, social and economic disadvantage all figured prominently in some of the indicators of young people's journeys to the point where they were so desperate they felt there was no future for them in this amazing country in which we live. We have people lining up from all around the world who want to come and live here. We have tragically young Australians who feel so disconnected from a hopeful future that they give up that opportunity for life. It is not a small thing.

I want to do that particularly because of my experience as a teacher. I want to put on record a brief story of an occasion in 2000—quite a long time ago now when you think about it. In 2000, I had the benefit of having some Swedish experts who worked in education and in drug and alcohol reform come to Australia. They were speaking to some outstanding Australian educators, who have absolutely, without doubt, amazing commitment to education and young people. The Swedish people asked these Australian educators, 'What do you do if you have a student who presents with drug and alcohol problems?' There was a series of steady responses: a low-order response, 'Provide support to the student, try to link them into other agencies.' The Swedes asked, 'What if there is a second incident, with a student bringing drugs to school or having drug issues or reports of this?' The Australians said: 'We would escalate it. We would attempt to try and connect them into agencies outside. But the school could not really continue in this way.' With a third incident generally it triggered an expulsion. The Swedish response I thought was quite interesting. They said, 'Well, what do you do then?' Thinking it was a language problem, the Australian educators repeated an explanation of the process. The Swedes replied: 'Yes, we understand what you said. But our question remains: what do you do then?'

There is wonderful work being done in schools and, happily, our suicide rate is not higher because of the outstanding work that teachers are doing in terms of identifying young people who might be at risk. Our wonderful schools are connecting outside the boundaries of the school fence into local community and health support agencies. But clearly we have not got it right when we look at the statistics on what we are confronting.

She was in a situation where there had been family breakdown. She had had an unstable upbringing in her adolescent years. She had felt isolated from her peers. She continued to attend school for some period of time but she was the first to admit she had become quite a problem in school. She reached the age of 17 and showed up at school on that day. She said, 'My present on my 17th birthday was a form to fill out for me to leave that school.' Because she was a problem she was sent away from school. That is not the case in most schools but it is the case in some schools.

That program is a very powerful tool that schools are using. But in that research it became very evident that there were teachers in the secondary setting who understood the need for care for young people and intervention when they needed to assist and also understood the implications of curriculum planning that could have positive or negative mental health outcomes for kids. But there was also one piece of evidence that was gathered that I read where a teacher of mathematics said, 'I teach mathematics. What I do has nothing to do with the mental health and wellbeing of the kids in my class.' I sense for that person, who was obviously dedicated to teaching and a long-term teacher, that while they saw their professional identity framed in terms of information and skill development in mathematics, that had somehow become divorced from their ethical, moral, spiritual and social responsibility to look after the whole person in their care in the classroom.

Recommendation 7 is that the Australian government, in consultation with state and territory governments and non-government stakeholders, establish partnerships between departments of education and community-based service providers to ensure continuity of care for school leavers by facilitating referral of students to external counselling services where appropriate. The need to make this recommendation is in some ways a little surprising, and I do note differences across the jurisdictions. For example, in

Sadly, I have been in the situation in my own office at the university trying to make phone calls to get support for students with local agencies and actually being told, 'That's not our job.' These are cavernous cracks that open when agencies are not working with a person's wellbeing at the centre of their role definition and when we have got this, I suppose, boundary riding between different agencies.

This is a very significant recommendation. ACARA is undertaking significant reform at this point in time of the whole of the national curriculum. The reality is that if, as an educator, you have a student who is hungry or physically or mentally unwell then investing in attempting to get them to learn is a zero-sum game if you are not going to enable them to feel well about where they are.

But I would like to add to that. In addition to the students being mentally healthy and well, we need to attend to the fact that teachers need to be mentally healthy and well. Sometimes recommendations for youth forget to look at those who are going to provide the services for the youth, and teachers are under pressure. It is a false assumption that every teacher has things so perfectly aligned in their life that they come to school equipped with resources enabling them to respond to the real and pressing needs of students who are at suicide ideation stage, for example, or even further down the track than that.

The reality is that, as we move to increasing the number of students who participate in further and higher education, we are dealing with students who are transitioning from one place to another, and that is a risk factor.

I hear that Swedish question again: whose responsibility are they now? What happens now? The end of the story from the Swedish people was that the community has invested so much in these young people—they have sent them to school, cared for them and provided health, education, resources and support—and here they are, on the cusp of a wonderful adulthood. Can there be any more important time for us to pay attention than right there and then as we launch them into that?

It is that teachers receive mandatory training in mental health awareness. I think that is for their benefit as well as that of their students. Looking after our colleagues is an important part of our role, as is looking after our students. The recommendation is for the inclusion of specific training to develop their capacity to recognise and assess suicidal risk. Teacher planning also needs to impact positively on students.

The thing that struck me was the number of people who committed suicide, because in that job I got to have an appreciation for the cause of death. Up until then, as a young 22-year-old, I had had no idea of the extent of the problem that existed. Certainly, now that experience is on my side in terms of life stage, suicide is something that has always sat there, that has been talked about quietly behind closed doors or that is often only talked about when it occurs directly for a family, where people do not understand the circumstances that a young person contemplates in taking their life—or ultimately those outside that.

I think sometimes that it is an area where we often do not contemplate the range of emotions that a young person experiences or the trials and tribulations that they are often faced with in the context of their social and peer interaction, and certainly within their own thinking, in terms of a professional pathway. I suppose what was most rewarding about the experience the committee had in this context was the brutal honesty of some of the young people in making very strong comment about their needs. I think as adults we make the mistake of not taking the time to listen or to reflect on what is required in order to address the needs and issues that young people are often faced with. One of the things I have always failed to comprehend or grasp is the lack of standardised reporting around suicide, because there are so many variables. I have worked in two jurisdictions in health, and, when we talked about overcoming Indigenous disadvantage for the

Geography is absolutely critical to the way decisions are made in the allocation of resources. It would also encompass educational attainment. I suspect, based on the work with the WA Institute for Child Health Research and the WA Aboriginal Child Health Survey that I had some involvement with, there were markers relating to the level of attainment. I noticed that young people who exited year 12 and who had a good grounding in education were in a better position to make informed choices about accessing services and where to direct their energy in seeking assistance. They knew there was a suite of opportunities for them to seek advice, to seek counsel. Particularly in the area of maternal child health, young people who left before year 10 were often constrained by their lack of educational attainment in understanding the opportunities and avenues through which they could seek the type of support that was required.

If you are unemployed, you have a low level of educational attainment and there are geographic issues, then coping in life becomes more complex, because there are added variables. Another factor that is absolutely critical that has to be considered in the context of a national standardised data collection, through every state and territory and nationally, is socioeconomic status. That is a factor that is often overlooked. It is understood in the conversations, but we do not have any rich information that informs the way in which agencies may respond.

But when I sought answers on how the decisions are made against a set of criteria—what is the basis for making those decisions using well-defined data, evidence and trending?—I was somewhat disappointed with the answer I received. It was really based on developing programs and developing policy that was meant to be universal across the nation and within jurisdictions. I often think that in that instance when we make those decisions, having been a public servant previously, we have not used the hard data to show the evidence of the exact degree of need by region and by locality. Until we do that, we will continue to not address the underlying issues that bring young people to a point at which their frustration and their anguish leads them to take their life.

I had a notion that it was to do with a suicide, because I had heard from a club that her son was involved with that he was no longer there. I called in to see the mother, and I sat on her front veranda. She wanted us to use the front veranda so that we would have the opportunity of speaking privately. She said to me, 'You know my son committed suicide,' and I said, 'No, I did not know that exactly, but I had an inkling that that was a challenge that I would have to discuss with you this afternoon, and I am pleased to be here.' And what she talked to me about was the incomprehensible notion that her son had taken his life. I asked her whether there was any sign at any point, or any avenue of help for her. She said she did not know of any avenue of help other than where she could go for advice on his funeral. She said she had no inkling he was going to do this. She came home from work and then they had a conversation. He then spent time tidying up his bedroom and doing things that were not typical. She said that, in hindsight, she wished she had known that that was some indication there was a problem. She said he went about his business and then sat down and had tea with them. He asked for one of his favourite meals. He then spent some more time with the family and then said he was going to bed. But he came back out and asked his mother if he could take the dog in with him. His dog was always with him. She said that, later that morning, she heard him get up and go outside but, because of the nature of his job, she did not give any thought to that. About an hour later she thought to go outside and take a look, and what she found was that he had taken his life. She said to me, 'You and one other person are the only people who have come to talk to me about my anguish, my pain and my lack of understanding as to why my son, who had so much to give and so much to offer and was an integral part of the family, did this.' And his twin is also facing the same issue.

She said that it would have helped if she had she known about and read about suicide. A thing that worried her was the notion of copycat suicides. She said that until we have the intervention, unless we have that type of support for these people——meaning the young men and women who associated with her son—something was likely to happen to another. They felt the grief, and that was certainly evident at the funeral.

What they have done is bring together the senior Aboriginal women. They have also brought together a whole group of young people to talk about what adults and elders within the community need to understand about suicide and the signs they should look for.

What we often heard was that the non-government sector had a reporting expectation but the sharing of information was not widespread or common. And yet they all had a patch in the suicide prevention field.

The committee's report says we should listen to what young people flag as the issues. My colleagues on the committee talked about a roundtable they held in the south-eastern region of Australia. They talked about the richness of the shared experiences that young people provided to them as a committee. What they also found was a depth of feeling about the need for help. I hope that our report, before it is too late, will give young people the opportunity to influence the agenda. We have to think about every point of transaction and interaction between every form of government agency and non-government agency and the communities in which we live and which we influence. We need to think about the ways in which they can reach out and help people who are screaming out for the type of intervention that will set them on a pathway such that they will not take their life. We need to give these people the type of help that they need so that they can build the strength to take the pathway of opportunity that they were destined for. It is sad in our country to see loss of life when we could and should have intervened.

And I want to work with them to look at the ways in which we can change and influence others so that we can bring about effective ways of saving lives and providing pathways of hope and opportunity. We need to give families the strength to have the discussions, to reach out, to understand and to influence their young family members so that in the future they will not have to experience grief.

He makes a real commitment and shows understanding of the issues that come before the committee. This is an issue that impacts on every member in this parliament. It is something that we have all be confronted with at some time or another: the news that a young person in our electorate has taken their life. Then you see the impact that that has on all the other young people within that school or their social group. It has this ripple effect and causes so much anxiety and pain to so many members of that community. It is very sad when a young life so full of promise ends without that promise being realised.

It was not just about sitting around a table and hearing about problems; it was about hearing about what problems there were now and looking towards the future to what actions could be taken to improve the situation. When we look at youth suicide, we all ask the question of why young people take their lives. One of the first things that comes to mind is the fact that young people tend to not think through the consequences of their actions. They do this without realising that if they take their lives there is no tomorrow; that is it. The friends that they believe will mourn for them will do so. But, unfortunately, they will never know about that, because once they have actually taken their lives that is the end of it. There has been a lot of research undertaken as to why young people take their lives and how, as a community, we can take action to prevent this and how it can be recognised before it happens. There is no one answer to the question. It is very varied. There are a number of different signals that can be given in relation to a person's intention to commit suicide. The member for Hasluck gave a perfect example of a young person who approached it in a very planned way. Quite often the young person will have an argument with somebody and does not think through the consequences of their actions.

One of those is gender. There are many more young males who take their life than young females. The area in which a person lives also contributes to the likelihood that they will commit suicide. It is a well-known fact that is supported by research that young people living in rural and remote areas are more likely to take their lives. If you add to that the fact that they may be Indigenous, they are even more likely to take their own lives. So there are some particular geographic and social factors that can be indicators of the likelihood of a person committing suicide. Also things like unemployment, loss and separation, peer rejection, social isolation, imprisonment, poor communication skills and a family history of suicide and mental illness. It is important that as a society we recognise these as important issues.

There does not seem to be a lot of consistency in it. There is a definite belief by professionals working in the field and by those people who are associated with recording the data that they do not truly reflect the number of youth suicides that take place. One explanation for this is that where it is uncertain, the coroner will always deliver an open verdict because it is much better, much easier for family and friends to cope with that fact. Also, there are reports of young people who drive their cars into a tree and it is recorded as a car accident not as a youth suicide.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There is a need for a standardised approach to the reporting of youth suicide and there needs to be more research done in this area. The committee recommended that this was one of the actions that should take place. It also recommended standardised reporting of ethnicity, culture, geography, educational attainment and employment status, which is a very big issue. Socioeconomic status is another factor as to whether a person is likely to take their own life. Young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to take their lives more frequently than those from a higher socioeconomic background. But, having said that, the fact is that young people who take their own lives come from all socioeconomic groups, and every young life that is lost is a loss for the future of this country—a loss of opportunity and an opportunity cost—and we should be working towards making sure it stops.

Part of that roundtable was earmarked as confidential because there were in attendance a group of young people who are openly shared with us their experiences. It was very moving. These young people told us how they had attempted to take their own life on a number of occasions or that they had had someone in their family take their own life, and how they had developed a support network that they were rolling out throughout communities across the country. The absolute openness of those young people was so refreshing, and it was enlightening—I learnt so much from them and their experiences. I also learnt that as a member of parliament there is a lot I can do, and a lot that we all can do.

The internet—and communication via the net—is both a resource and a tool for young people who are contemplating taking their own life, but it is also one of the things that can cause a person to become extremely unhappy or depressed. I am sure I am not unique in this and that other members have also been contacted by parents whose children were subjected to cyberbullying, impacting those young people to the extent where they have had to be removed from school and come very close to taking their own lives. And the bullying that takes place not only does so in their locality but spreads to whole regions, and it is extremely traumatic for the young people involved.

It is the positive side of the net. It tries to counteract the negatives of the net and build on the positives by linking into the way that young people communicate these days.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The fact is that we have so many good people out there working in this area, in this space, providing programs and assistance; but, as the member for Hasluck said, in many cases they are not talking to each other. We have got the federal government putting out some wonderful programs which they started in the previous parliament—and there was much more money put into suicide prevention measures in this budget; then we have got the state governments all contributing and doing some excellent work in the area; and then there is the non-government sector, working long and hard to provide wonderful programs. The problem is that they are not talking to each other. So one of the things that the committee felt very strongly about was the need for everybody to talk to each other and work together and to remember that it is this young person who needs the assistance and the best way to do that is through a structured plan where that person is at the centre of it rather than through different organisations providing a fragmented service. It was also felt that there needed to be some sort of a continuation with programs once a person has either left an acute stage program or left the education system where they may have been receiving support so that the support and help that they got continues on.

Every person on that committee was totally committed to all the recommendations that we have in this report. There are 10 in all. We need to have more research, we need to have more communication, we need to listen to what the young people say, the programs that are provided need to be integrated and we need to spend a lot more time on ensuring that we have the right sourced data. I will conclude by reading out a tweet that I received from YACWA after we had been over there. The tweet said, 'Thank you for contributing to the roundtable.' Young people appreciate our support and they communicate with us—

It surprised me that it has been mentioned only eight times over both chambers in the past two years. That is not meant to be a reflection on anyone at all; it just surprised me that there has not been much of a conversation in this place about the issue itself.

But we have such a very long way to go, and we need to challenge the taboo in raising this topic for a broader national conversation. One of our greatest challenges is to reduce or remove the stigma about suicide and to talk about it in a responsible and rational manner. I believe we need this national conversation because staying silent simply has not worked. I welcome this opportunity to speak in relation to the report by the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing.

As a journalist on police rounds you would often be told about a death at the police station. But there was a policy in place within the media network and within our own newspaper not to report such incidents. The nearest comparison I can make is the old saying: if a tree falls in a forest and no-one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If a person commits suicide and no-one is allowed to talk about it, do their family and friends ever really get to grieve? Although the answer, I think, is self-evident—of course they grieve—if suicide remains such a taboo subject in our community and friends and family are not really allowed to talk about it and family members are too ashamed to admit the actual cause of death, how does the grieving process really get started? Also, if we are not prepared to talk about it and get a better understanding of what happened, how do we as a community learn from that experience.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

He highlighted some of the very real concerns where the family and friends of suicide victims—the ones who are left behind—have so many questions about what they could have done. Was there something they may have missed? For those of us who have never experienced a mental illness it is very difficult even to understand why a person would take their own life. Sometimes there are simply no reasons. The previous speaker mentioned some of the risk factors, and there are risk factors that are very well known. But on other occasions there are simply no explanations. Sometimes it really does make no sense at all.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with any problem, if we can measure it we should be able to manage it. That is an issue in this case because we are talking about something—the suicide death rates in Australia—about which we do not know the full extent of the problem. The official statistics put the suicide rate in Australia at around about 2,000 to 2,200 people per year, but I have read reports in which estimates were put forward that the figure could be as much as 16 per cent higher, which means we could be talking about suicide deaths in the order of 3,000 people per year. Although this confusion is regrettable, it is also understandable because it is very difficult for the authorities involved to be determining the intent when assessing the cause of death in circumstances such as car accidents or drug overdoses. It is very difficult in the absence of compelling evidence like a suicide note to know for sure that the person intended to end their own life. Also, there is a stigma attached to a suicide and therefore pressure, whether it is implied or real, to protect the reputation of the surviving family members or friends, particularly in regional settings, where people get to hear about the suicide and wonder what was wrong and what was going on behind the scenes. Questions are asked, particularly in a smaller regional setting. I am not suggesting for a second that there is any impropriety or anything like that. I am just making the point that the investigators and the authorities are sometimes under implied pressure not to officially declare a suicide in circumstances where it is likely the death was probably self-inflicted and may well have been deliberate but there remained an element of doubt, so an open finding is given.

Even if we take that official figure of around 2,000 it is an alarming figure. It means that during the last four days of parliamentary sittings probably 25 Australians will have ended their lives deliberately.

Referring to the report, its finding was that for young people aged 15 to 24 suicide is the number one cause of death. Young males in particular in regional areas are one of the highest risk categories for premature death from suicide. Despite an increase in funding over the past decade it still receives less mainstream public policy attention than issues like road safety and even sun protection.

I believe that is a critical step. Such a campaign should target the at-risk groups—other members have talked about the risk factors, which are reasonably well understood—but should also apply at a more universal level to help build resilience, to help an entire community understand what the risk factors may be and, perhaps, to drive the national conversation about this topic, which has been taboo for too long.

I would like to congratulate the program, its host, Kathy Bedford, and the producers and staff involved. They have tackled this in what I believe is a very sensitive manner. I am sure that it is confronting for people, but I think we need to do it, and the media is an important tool at our disposal for raising awareness and assisting our community. I noted in the report and in previous reports we had talks about developing the use of social media so that we are interacting with young people in a medium that suits them.

Increasingly young people rely on their mobile phones, and you do not want anyone not being able to seek help simply because they are out of credit on their phone. So I think that is a very important initiative.

Other members, I am sure, like me, visit a lot of schools. We get to talk to a lot of young people. And we can help to pass on the critical messages which one day may help save a life.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I often think of youth suicide in particular as a permanent solution to what may have been a temporary problem, and I noted the previous speaker indicating that young people can be impetuous; they can take action without fully understanding the consequences. But, with support and treatment and early intervention, I am sure that we can help to save lives.

We are all stakeholders in this issue and there is a lot of collective wisdom in this place. As much as we may belittle each other from time to time on different areas of policy, there is collective wisdom in this place, and we have the capacity in this place to do better on this issue. If we see a young person in our community who is struggling as a result of family breakdown, or abusing drugs and alcohol, or clearly suffering from some mental health issues, we need to be prepared to offer some level of support and be able to intervene. We need to have the tools at our disposal to be able to be the person who takes action and gets them the sort of help they need.

The report talks about the training of these so-called gatekeepers and the need for greater collaboration between all levels of government and service providers. One area that really does concern me is that we cannot afford to have these turf wars. We cannot have this silo mentality where one organisation is offering one level of assistance and another is offering something else and they become quite territorial. It makes it very hard for people, particularly young people who are not used to dealing with agencies and authorities and who may be disoriented anyway or unsure of what they need to do next; they do not need to be tied up in some sort of confusing maze of bureaucracy about which agency does what and who they need to go to see to seek help.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So I think there is a need for better collaboration. But, naturally, as a member from a regional area, I also believe there is a massive need for more investment in services in regional areas themselves, where it is often very difficult for people with mental health issues to receive support in their own communities. In my own electorate, almost invariably you have to travel if you need critical mental health assistance. I think we need to get the most out of every service that we already have and avoid duplication and confusion on the ground. On that gatekeeper training, I think that is a very important point made in the report. It is critical for people who work with younger members of our community that they have the skills to monitor, to detect any early warning signs, and then to help facilitate any treatment that may be available in that local community.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But I think the key point in all this is to remember that we can do it. We can save lives if we pass on the skills to our families and friends, and to teachers, youth workers, sports coaches, health professionals and law enforcement officers. Anyone who has regular contact with young people is in a position where they may be able to offer assistance with the right training in the future. As someone who is directly involved in surf lifesaving, I get to meet hundreds of young people in my community every year. They are almost without exception positive young achievers. But even among them you find issues of self-esteem, occasionally even bullying, even in a protected environment like a surf lifesaving club, where some kids do not feel quite up to it. You need to be able to help them to build their resilience and to take on challenges in a controlled manner. I think that is very important for them in helping them to build their self-esteem.

I am a strong believer in the benefits of physical exercise, particularly in getting young people involved in team sports and community activities where they are part of something which is bigger than themselves and where they can find a role for themselves in the community. They will see that there is hope for them—they will find there is reason in their life and that they are part of something much bigger than they may have realised. On that point, there are many local solutions which we can help to drive within the broader national framework which the two reports talk about.

Time for this discussion today is limited, but I encourage all members who are interested in the topic to continue to be involved. That we are having this conversation in this place is a major step forward; it is a very important step in the right direction. I know it is idealistic to believe that we can save every life, but I sincerely believe we can and must do better. I urge all members to work in a bipartisan manner to help prevent suicide in our community in future. Finally, I thank all the people in our community, the professional workers and the volunteers, who are already making a difference in this area. As a nation, we are indebted to you for the work you do for other people.

I will begin today by highlighting the importance of youth suicide prevention. In 2009, suicide was the leading cause of death for young people aged between 15 and 24, with 259 deaths. It continues to be the number one cause of death within the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Those at risk are often victims of bullying, including cyberbullying, harassment and discrimination. They can be made to feel worthless because they are socially isolated, are homeless or suffer mental illness like depression or anxiety. Developing a better understanding of why young people give in to suicidal tendencies will almost certainly help reduce the rate at which young people commit suicide.

There is no simple solution to the prevention of youth suicide, but one of the contributors to the report warns that a lack of action is only going to exacerbate the issue.

The APS also says that the problems or causes that lead to a young person taking their life need to be discovered and tackled head-on. Suggestions from the APS for an improved policy for preventing youth suicide include increasing frontline services, providing support for affected communities, targeting those who are at greatest risk, promoting mental health and wellbeing and creating additional 'headspace' and early psychosis prevention and intervention centres. Headspace was established with $69 million over five years by the Howard government in 2005 for the youth mental health initiative, and is an independent charitable foundation. It provides mental health and wellbeing support, information and services to young people between 12 and 25 years of age and their families. Headspace was established and funded by the coalition in 2006 across 30 sites around the country. The coalition's Real Action Plan for Better

At present, many professionals working with young people, the front-line staff and health professionals, will have completed the relevant course in mental first aid. The course is also available to others, including community staff, parents, carers and peers who are interested in completing the training. The APS has indicated that the key emphasis of this training is to take the information to the larger target audience rather than rely on traditional information-seeking behaviour. Therefore, the APS suggests distributing information about mental health issues in school newsletters and running information sessions at schools, community centres and local leisure centres.

MindMatters is working with high schools to embed promotion, prevention and early intervention activities for mental health and wellbeing and has been established since 2000. I believe programs like MindMatters, along with appropriate communication networks, are essential for the prevention of youth suicide.

Most of the time, those at risk of suicide need someone to talk to about the reasons they feel helpless. I would like to recognise the efforts of the Kids Helpline in providing a service to meet these young people's needs.

Despite national data suggesting that the rate of youth suicide is on the decline, Kids Helpline is seeing an increase in the numbers of contacts from young people about suicide related issues. The organisation made a submission to the inquiry setting out a total of 11 recommendations. The submission provides information based on their work with young people and, in particular, the rate of suicidal thinking among young Australians and the types of programs that can both prevent suicide and reduce the rate at which acute distress turns into suicidal thoughts.

Kids Helpline believes that ensuring free access to telephone services for all young people is essential in establishing contact with specialists who can help with youth issues and concerns. In 2009, one in five counselling sessions at the Kids Helpline were with a young person presenting with either a suicide related issue or self-harming behaviour, highlighting the need for our youth to be able to access pay phones not only for counselling purposes but also for their general safety and wellbeing. In addition to telecommunications, Kids Helpline has found that young people today prefer the anonymity of the online medium. During the last two years the rate of contact where current thoughts of suicide were expressed through the online medium was 33 per cent. The kidshelp.com.au website allows the opportunity to gather information and provides a two-way communication model through the 'Tell us your story' link, encouraging young people to share their experiences and the ways in which they overcame their problems. The organisation stresses the website is an example of an e-health initiative that can reduce the social isolation of children and young people through the power of modern information and communication technology.

This shows that young males are more likely to keep to themselves instead of reaching out. This is certainly of concern and should be of concern to us in the community. While thoughts of suicide remain higher with women, men are more likely to commit suicide, at a rate of four to one. This highlights the need to increase research into how we can engage with males to ensure that they are getting the help that they need.

We have some really shocking stats for Australian suicide rates. We know that around 40 people a week are killing themselves and, of those, around 30 are men. Obviously, every person, every individual is actually leaving a bereaved family member, co-worker and friends and the community, which then impacts on their mental health and then the ripples just sort of continue.

In 2006 the former coalition government made the single biggest investment in mental health by any government in Australian history with $1.9 billion being committed over a five-year period for services for people with mental illness, their families and their carers. A commitment to mental health needs to be upheld, and I would hope that this would include support of early intervention programs aimed at reducing the rate of youth suicide, as these lives are certainly worth saving.

When I first came to this place I tried to get the committee to visit Mackay, given some issues that we have got there, but I understood it had moved on from the visits and that the public work was mainly done in the 42nd Parliament.

It is mentioned that suicide is the second most common cause of death after traffic accidents. We have to wonder, as is outlined further in the report, how many of those accidents may actually be suicides themselves when we have single-vehicle fatalities where it is not quite clear what the cause is. The report goes on to highlight that more than three-quarters of young people who commit suicide are male and that the suicide rate of people in rural areas is three times higher than that of their counterparts in cities. The fact that those statistics could be understated, as the report says—and there is certainly evidence outlined to that effect—is in itself shocking. The latest figures for suicide cited in the report are from 2009—and, as I said, they are probably underestimated—and show that, among those aged between 15 and 25, there were 259 suicides in that year. That means that, based on these rates, these understated rates, since we began sitting this week, there would have been two young people who have committed suicide and, by the time we finish, another two.

Mackay City part A was ranked second from 2001 to 2004 in terms of per capita suicide rates overall—not just youth suicide rates. Thankfully, that seems to have dropped somewhat in the following years, but we still have the reputation of being the region with the fifth highest suicide rate in Queensland. That, I have to say, was all done before the spate of youth suicides in Mackay which I outlined previously in this House, and I do want to touch on that issue again.

As I said, Mackay has this terrible suicide rate; it used to be the fifth worst, but I am told it is now up to being the second worst in Queensland. That is in contrast with the view that Mackay, because of the mining boom, is financially advantaged. In fact, Mackay is extremely socially disadvantaged. We have families on high incomes but they are being fragmented by shiftwork, with fathers and husbands, often wives as well, being away from home. It is four days on, four days off in mine work, or worse than that. Families without the high incomes from mining pay a high social price for living in a boom town with astronomical rents and high prices. There are currently 30 to 40 young people per month that are identifying as homeless or experiencing severe family breakdown in the Mackay region as part of the mining boom. I state that because I really want to give the perspective of the Dawson electorate to feed into this report.

But I have to say that the Youth Information and Referral Service in Mackay, now known as YIRS One Stop Youth Shop, transformed itself into this 24-hour, round-the-clock crisis centre, with staff monitoring and talking to the kids, patrolling the streets and doing all the things that needed to be done to ensure that these children did not take their own lives. I want to refer to Dannielle Wiseman who is a service manager for the YIRS One Stop Youth Shop. I have a statement of witness that the police took, which Dannielle has given to me to use in this respect. It really is a detailed and heart-wrenching report. The names are removed to allay any concerns, but she talks about YIRS providing service there and what they did. She says:

At the very best, less than a third of the people with severe mental illness get any care at all and probably only 1 to 5 per cent are getting care that's adequate for them to function as well as possible …

I have scoured it. But I am going to read it at length. Some of the recommendations that I have looked through revolved around improvement of services, particularly ones that have been seen to be working. The comment has come in there about headspace. Headspace is one of those recognised services that does something that actually works in this field.

I do hope that one of those highlights the need for expanded youth mental health facilities in the Mackay region so that all levels of government take notice. Certainly this report points in that direction. The more ammunition that we can get as a community to address mental health issues and youth suicide in the Mackay region the better.

I will end with her words. She said:

However it saddens me to say I know a 14 year old who never made it to 15, because he couldn't find a way back. A 20 year old that never had a 21st because to make the hurt stop he stopped everything, and last month another precious life gone at 22. I will never be a number, a statistic on a piece of paper for a faceless person who never knew me, to say what a shame. People need help the most when they say they don't, and any help is better than nothing, especially when they don't realise how close to the edge they are.

Contained within this report are some of the answers. I know the government is working in this direction, but more needs to be done and more needs to be done soon, particularly in the Mackay region. I commend the report.

With only 35 per cent of those with mental illness being able to get access to quality care, it is clear that more needs to be done around early detection and other measures. Indeed, in Australia, according to the ABS, suicide is the 14th most frequent cause of death. But in the age bracket of 15- to 24-year-olds it is the No. 1 cause of death. In 2009, 24 per cent of people in that age bracket died by suicide. It is more common in males than females. A remarkable 76 per cent of those who were lost through suicide in 2009 were males. In the 15 to 24 year age bracket, suicide rates are three times higher for those living in remote and rural locations, and the rate is four times higher for Indigenous people in the 12 to 24 age bracket. Hopefully those statistics give some sense of the scope and nature of the problem that we face.

We clearly need more front-line psychological and psychiatric services. We need greater collaboration between service providers. We need additional support for those communities that are affected by suicide. We need to target those people, those individuals, who are at greatest risk of suicide. We need to promote the idea of wellbeing and mental health more robustly in our community. We need to improve the level of mental health literacy among all of us. Specifically, places like the headspace site referred to earlier are very, very important. Currently around Australia there are 30 of these sites, and I welcome moves to increase this number to 90.

This is a really worthwhile initiative and deserves to be supported. Likewise, in my own electorate of Kooyong I would like to see a headspace site. I think access to these services for young people would be a great improvement on what is currently available.

Under the individual, it talks about substance abuse, homelessness, mental illness, poor coping skills, chronic pain or illness; under the social, it talks about abuse, violence, family dispute, conflict and dysfunction, peer rejection, social isolation and imprisonment; and, under the contextual, it talks about a lack of support services, poverty and neighbourhood violence. These are all factors that government experts tell us help to create a situation in which suicide is more likely.

While research funding has increased more than threefold since 2001-02, it still sits at only about $65 million per annum. There must be scope to explore new ways of capitalising on social media and the internet to engage with our young people to mitigate the risk of suicide. New youth suicide prevention measures are also recommended, as well as adopting an holistic approach to these new measures which takes into account cultural, educational, employment, social and economic disadvantage factors.

Often you can find a school student getting advice and support on mental health related issues but once they leave school they are left to their own devices. We need better partnerships between the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and community based providers to ensure that these people do not fall between the cracks. We need to encourage our teachers to receive specific training on mental health awareness to increase their capacity to recognise and assess suicidal risk and to ensure that those people get the best attention.

I pay credit to those in the industry like Patrick McGorry, John Mendoza and many others people who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes for years to create greater awareness in government about what needs to be done. Not everything can be provided by the private sector. Not everything can be left to the market. Mental health is one such issue where governments need to step in.

Now that this body of work exists, it is incumbent upon government to take its recommendations, to consider them and hopefully to introduce them into Australian society.

I have a particular interest in this area as a mother of two young girls. My interest in the external influences of the wallpaper of our society on my two girls has sparked a particular interest generally in this issue. I made some public comments recently about the importance of having appropriate images out there in the public domain. Like many others in the community and some organisations specifically established to comment on the inappropriateness of images in the public domain and the premature sexualisation of young children, I was waiting to see what the committee report would come up with. I have to say that I am bitterly disappointed. It is telling the advertising industry, 'It is okay, you can keep doing what you have been doing.' It is as effective as a slap with a wet lettuce. It is a total cop out. It is almost a waste of time for the committee to have sat and listened to evidence and then gone through the draft report and corrected it.

It has rejected calls for G-ratings on advertising billboards and it has called for advertisers to be named and shamed online if they put up inappropriate images. But I would argue that this would be as effective as Fuelwatch and Grocery Watch.

It occupies public space. It is privileged space. It is open to all, whether it is on billboards, bus shelters or park benches. This unique character of outdoor advertising was accepted by the committee and that is what has brought it to the attention of so many Australians who are concerned about the issue.

They say this for two apparent reasons. One is that the industry does not want it—surprise, surprise. The other is that comparable countries have not done so yet. I think that is a total and utter cop out. The test should be: what does the public think is acceptable for our children to view and be affected by? What does medical evidence say about the images that continually bombard our children? The medical evidence is saying that all of these images are death by a thousand cuts; they are affecting our children's emotional development and they are affecting them later on in life. This is the sort of evidence that should be looked at. I am astounded that this did not weigh more heavily on the minds of the committee members. The committee stated:

I wonder if Ms Bain has actually looked at the medical evidence, both in Australia and overseas, on the impact that inappropriate advertising—highly sexualised and suggestive advertising—is having on young children. Colleagues on both sides of the House, this is not about the rights of an advertiser against the rights of a so-called wowser who does not want to watch; this is about whether the advertising dollar is more important than the welfare of our children, whether the advertising dollar speaks louder than the collective public conscience about the sort of environment in which we want our children to grow up.

In other words: 'Thank you, little committee members; you've done your little work and, guess what, we're not going to take much notice of it because we're so good that we're already doing the things you want us to do.' Well, they are not acting appropriately, and this committee has let go of an ideal opportunity to actually do something real about this problem.

It goes on to say that 'the regulation of outdoor advertising should not be more lax than that of advertising in other media.' Yet we know that other forms of media are far more highly regulated, so this seems to be a contradiction in the report.

We have regulation in other parts of our life. One wonders why the committee were so hostile to actually having some form of real regulation in this area. I would not say that the personal views of members of the committee influenced their opinion about regulation about highly sexualised images; I would not say that the chair of the committee, the member for Moreton, who is known to be an author of highly racy novels, was influenced in the recommendations of the report by his personal opinions and the literature he has written—but others may.

It is not like the television, which you can just switch off. This has been recognised by the Outdoor Media Association. They acknowledge the impact and the reach that their advertising has. They say that it can achieve direct communication with consumers wherever they go—'where they live, work, play, where they drive and shop, where they commute, and where they congregate'. Billboard and outdoor advertising is probably the most in-your-face, unavoidable form of public advertising, and there have been some pretty shocking and highly sexualised images in it over the last few years.

As I said before, it is about not just one image but an accumulation of images that have such an extraordinary impact. We as adults may be totally numb and immune to much of this imagery, but anyone who has had small children knows that they are sponges and absorb so much more in their environment than we do, which is why the failure of self-regulation is having such a disproportionately damaging impact on our young children.

I have said before—and I will repeat it in this chamber—that we need to have a statutory body with some real powers, including the power to issue serious fines to offenders. Why can't it be the time to codify community standards and put weight on medical opinion about the impacts on children? We err on the side of caution so often in public policy. We have heard of the precautionary principle when it comes to environmental policy, but where is the precautionary principle when it comes to protecting children and providing a safe environment in which they will grow and develop?

So what is the answer? What does the committee say to parents who are concerned about this imagery, who have seen self-regulation fail, who have seen reports where the media mock the committee's recommendations, claiming the recommendations support their current position and what they are doing? What do you say to parents who say that you have failed as a committee?

We are not talking about how liberal you are, your civil libertarian values, about what you should read or what you should see. You can do whatever you want in the privacy of your own home as long as it is legal. That is what we in the parliament, on both sides of the House, generally believe. I am not talking about that; I am talking about the protection of children. Some people have said to me, 'Oh, well, kids need to grow up; they need to know what it's like in the real world.' Actually, there is a time and a place that is appropriate for such knowledge, comments and imagery. Young children do not have the capacity to process and understand much of the sexual imagery with which they come into contact in the public domain.

I am sure it will be greeted with great acclaim by the sectors of the advertising industry that have not yet commented on it and with disappointment by the rest of the community that is focused on child welfare. Do not call us wowsers, because we are not. Do not call us people who want to restrict the free market, because we are not. We are looking after the health and welfare of young children. I am sure that one impact this report will have is to put wind into the sails of the community organisations and parents out there who are fighting this great problem in our community. Just because we as adults are immune, are numb or have become desensitised to certain images does not mean that our children are not affected by them.

As the chair of the committee, the member for Moreton, has said on a number of occasions, the very nature of outdoor advertising makes it unavoidable. As University of Melbourne academic Lauren Rosewarne says:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p class="italic">
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Unlike the ‘private’ world of magazine and television advertising, outdoor advertising is displayed throughout public space, thus making regulation of the medium a pertinent public policy concern. The inescapable nature of outdoor advertising, compounded with the increasingly sexualised display of women within, demands that an active public policy response occurs.

When we drive down the major freeways of our big cities and even down our suburban streets, we are exposed to an onslaught of often highly provocative and highly effective outdoor advertising. From billboards, public transport shelters and kiosks to public toilets, park benches and phone booths, we live in a world saturated by advertising—and the committee took a wide range of evidence of these images, amongst other things. There is saturation with things like ads for nasal-delivery erectile dysfunction sprays, naked men pictured wearing dog collars and leashes to sell pantyhose and Lolita-like ads with women looking extremely childlike with lollipops, in seductive poses, to sell handbags. When people are faced with all this, I can fully understand why our community says, ''Enough is enough.' Unlike with other forms of advertising, we do not have the power to turn the page or change the channel. Every member of the community is stuck with the same overt billboard or other form of outdoor advertising until it is replaced by a potentially more contentious one.

This report comprises five chapters containing 19 recommendations. As well as making these recommendations to the government, the committee has made them to relevant industry bodies, acknowledging that neither the government nor the committee has authority over these industry bodies in many respects. One of the major concerns being expressed by stakeholders is the fact that the advertising industry is a self-regulating one. The committee recognises that the advertising industry has demonstrated some willingness to review and make changes to this system of self-regulation. The committee understands that the advertising industry has the opportunity to implement the recommendations contained in this report in order to improve its own operation.

The first is the oversexualisation of advertising. We are increasingly being subjected to oversexualised displays in media and especially in advertising. Advertisers realise the effectiveness of using sex to sell, and they consistently rely on the objectification of the female body to convey many a message. The committee looked at a number of examples displaying overt sexualisation of the female body in outdoor advertising, some of which I am sure many members is this place would, unfortunately, be familiar with.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>

This particular marketing campaign was entitled 'I love sex.' This campaign saw billboards displaying a naked woman, a man covering her breasts with his hands and the word 'sex' behind her head. I suppose one could be forgiven for thinking that this clothing chain is in the business of selling something other than clothes. As a result of the ad, a number of complaints by the public were made, including by one of my own constituents.

These images can sometimes be located near places of worship, schools and childcare centres and, as a result, expose all parts of the community to often controversial messages that cannot be avoided.

One of the most concerning aspects of exposing our young people to such oversexualised images in such public places is the effect it can have on their body image and their expectations of the other sex. This issue becomes even more problematic when we see our young people so obsessed with the superficial and the glamorous. Adolescent psychologist Dr Sloane Madden of Westmead Childrens Hospital details the rather frightening realities that our young people are experiencing:

Nearly 1 in 4 are dieting. I think there is a growing concern amongst eating disorder professionals around the world that children at this age are being subjected to increasingly sophisticated adult messages, messages equating thinness with success—sexualised images—presented to children at an age when really they're psychologically unable to understand those images.

By exposing children to oversexualised images—which is what currently occurs, unfortunately, in some outdoor advertising—we leave open a range of social, psychological and physical problems for our young people. These are problems no child should have to face.

The committee made 19 recommendations to industry to improve its processes. Some of these recommendations were as follows. The committee recommended that the Attorney-General's Department review by 30 June 2013 the self-regulatory system for advertising by evaluating industry's implementation reports and assessing the extent to which there has been effective implementation of the recommendations contained in the committee's report. Under recommendation 4, the committee recommended that the Attorney-General's Department look to include 'the unrestricted display of racist or sexualised images in the public space' in the scope of discriminatory practices with the intention of reducing the number of over-sexualised images that we currently see displayed on many billboards. Under recommendation 8, the committee recommended:

The report has delivered 19 recommendations to government and industry in order to improve the processes governing outdoor advertising so that they better reflect community standards. I am sure that the committee's report will be welcomed by many in my electorate, where there has been considerable concern about the standard of outdoor advertising. In closing, I thank my fellow committee members for all their hard work in contributing to this report. I make special mention of the committee chair, the member for Moreton, and the committee deputy chair, the member for Pearce. I thank the committee secretary, Dr Anna Dacre, and everyone else involved with the committee secretariat. I believe we worked in a very constructive manner on a very important issue. We took a wide range of written and in-person evidence, all of which was taken seriously and analysed thoroughly. It has been a privilege to be part of this committee, and I do hope the recommendations outlined in this report go a long way to seeing us reclaim our public space.

Self-regulation in its current form is not working; regulation needs to be strengthened.

During the course of the committee's inquiry, when there were seven public hearings—in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne—and 51 public submissions offered, we saw movement from the advertising industry. They have to accept that the community is concerned with sexually exploitative, provocative, violent or sexually discriminatory images that are shown clearly on places such as those adjacent to schools or churches, out the front of airports or on major highways, particularly in South-East Queensland, where I come from. At first the advertising industry were saying that statistics about this issue backed up their story, but in fact, when you delved deeper into this particular issue, you discovered that just over 2,000 complaints were forwarded to the Advertising Standards Bureau, of which just over 10 per cent were found to be in breach of the advertising codes of practice. It looked all right but, of those 2,000 complaints, 437 were for outdoor advertising and 35.7 per cent related to advertising that breached the codes of practice. Of the 90 outdoor advertisements that the Advertising Standards Board considered, 16.67 percent were found to be in breach, compared to less than 10 per cent for all other categories. So outdoor advertising breaches the codes of practice more frequently. Four of the top 10 most-complained-about issues about advertisements were for outdoor advertising.

Unrestricted, untargeted audiences can be seen, and this can have a cumulative effect, as the previous speaker said. There is concern in the committee and in the community about the complaints-based aspects and all the burden of complaint resting on the public. The public is not necessarily aware of how to make the complaint. Often the public, consumers, are time poor and not necessarily, as I said, aware of how to do it. We recommended that the Advertising Standards Bureau actually advertise the complaint process more and increase its accessibility.

The committee found that it is not clear how these standards are established and recommended that research be conducted to determine the prevailing community standards in relation to outdoor advertising; the use of sex, sexuality and nudity; health and safety; advertising food and beverages; advertising alcohol; and advertising to children.

Everyone from the whole spectrum, from the civil liberties groups to the more conservative Christian groups, lodged submissions in relation to this. They were not all saying the same thing, but it was interesting that many sang from the same hymn sheet, really, in relation to this issue. It was quite clear.

It must clean up its act. It may shape up and get its house in order or, by 2013, this report recommends the government intervene. This is a really big warning to that industry. It really needs to look at itself. The lack of enforcement powers and sanctions for noncompliance with the voluntary codes was a consistent criticism of the advertising self-regulatory system. The committee is of the view that, to instil public confidence in this system, you need to have muscle. For example, we need to have more public exposure and disclosure. The information, in relation to complaints decisions, should not be buried in websites or tucked away but should be transparent and obvious—listed by their parent company's name rather than the product name, for example, so everyone knows which company has offended against codes of practice. We think there should be a prominent webpage, dedicated to naming the products and the advertisers which breach, circulating the names of non-compliant advertisers to third-party media organisations such as the Outdoor Media Association, providing the names of non-compliant advertisers and getting this out into the public's domain—getting public scrutiny. Pre-vetting or copy advice is something which is world's best practice but it is not always done. Providing independent, non-binding copy advice to advertisers prior to running a campaign is recommended. Given the unavoidable impact of outdoor advertising, this can be done, but that advertisement can be displayed for a month or more before action is taken. So we think that it is necessary that copy advice or pre-vetting be provided for all outdoor advertising and we think there needs to be monitoring in this regard. The idea of world's best practice is simply to random-monitor outdoor advertising, so we think it should be complied with. We think compliance surveys should be conducted at locations such as near schools or sports grounds or for specific industries such as alcohol. The Australian Association of National Advertisers is currently reviewing its code, and it is not before time; it is the first time in over a decade. It plans to review other codes in the new year. The committee recommended that voluntary advertising codes be reviewed on an annual basis, or a regular basis certainly.

We recommended that the alcohol beverages advertising code system be monitored by an intergovernmental committee. We were also concerned about the proximity and the juxtapositioning of alcohol with sports. The Australian Association of National Advertisers' food and beverage code restricts the advertising of unhealthy food products to children. The committee was disappointed that sports sponsorship was not included in the code and recommended that sports sponsorship be recognised as a form of advertising and therefore subject to advertising codes of practice relating to food and to children.

The member for Indi is simply wrong to criticise her Liberal colleagues in the way she did. I want to commend the member for Moreton for his leadership as chair of this particular committee. To make the kind of surreptitious slurs that she did in relation to him was unseemly, unnecessary and beneath her. The member for Moreton did a fantastic job. I also want to commend the deputy chair, the member for Pearce, for the spirit in which she participated in this inquiry. This was a difficult inquiry and the coalition members contributed in an exemplary way. To cast aspersions on her own colleagues in the way the member for Indi did tonight is really quite shameful. They must have interesting party meetings. I would be very interested in how they might vote in any internal Liberal Party ballot in the future. It was a derogatory diatribe about the integrity of the committee, including her three Liberal colleagues. As I said, it was a unanimous bipartisan report. I congratulate the secretariat, who make us all look very good in this place.

Our presence in Africa has decreased from 12 diplomatic missions to eight in the past 25 years. We have significantly less diplomatic representation than a number of our trading partners such as Canada, Korea and Malaysia—not to say that we have significantly less diplomatic representation in Africa than the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom.

There are great trading opportunities in agriculture, resources and tourism.

So clearly there are great opportunities for Australian businesses to partner with African countries to our mutual benefit.

Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, the currency was worthless and still the international community, particularly Zimbabwe's African neighbours, stood still and stayed quiet. Would you believe that Zimbabwe was elected to a three-year term to the UN's Human Rights Council? I am all for international bodies, but when they kick dirt in our faces by electing the likes of Zimbabwe to a UN human rights body you have to ask, 'What is it all about?' Clearly, quiet diplomacy does not work with Zimbabwe and something more dramatic needs to be done.

That is no excuse to abuse human rights and suspend democracy. Mugabe is a dictator of the worst kind. It is an indictment on many of our international partners that something more has not been done.

They try to intimidate their political opponents. The rapes, the bashings, the poverty, the lack of education and health systems to speak of—thousands of people have died of cholera—are completely intolerable. I know that Kevin Rudd thinks that he is going to bring peace to mankind, and particularly to Libya, but why does he not pay more attention to Zimbabwe? Isn't it time that Australia, as a Commonwealth nation, made Zimbabwe an absolute priority for our foreign policy? There might be a power-sharing agreement between Morgan Tsvangirai and President Mugabe, but it is a power-sharing agreement in name only. There is no real democracy, there are no human rights and millions and millions of people lie scared in their beds.

It points to how we can strengthen our relationships with the countries of Africa. As I said at the start, Africa may not be in our diplomatic backyard, like Asia and the South Pacific, but it is a very valuable country in terms of Australia's global interests, and we have a moral obligation to help the millions of people in Africa who are dealing with extreme poverty and a lack of governance. I pay tribute to the chair of the committee, Senator Forshaw, his deputy chair, the member for Gilmore, and the secretariat for their important work. But I say to our Minister for Foreign Affairs and to our Prime Minister: Zimbabwe under Mugabe is a blight on the world and it is a blight on your foreign policy record. With

For too long, Africa has been a continent that has not received from Australia the attention it deserves, except perhaps in the form of the images of non-government organisations delivering aid projects in Africa and, to a lesser extent, of Australia's participation in UN peacekeeping missions. Unfortunately, this has meant that some Australians tend to associate Africa only with extreme poverty, corruption and conflict.

Overall, it is a more stable, free and prosperous continent than 10 years ago. Following economic reforms, many African countries have enjoyed strong growth in recent years. Africa is especially rich in resources, offering major economic opportunities but posing a challenge to governments. Collectively, African countries are becoming more important in global economic and political terms. They play an influential role in multilateral forums, including in the

The reality is that Africa is significant to Australia's interests in so many ways, not just economically, but also politically, strategically, educationally, environmentally and socially and from a global and regional security point of view. Indeed, it is a matter of common sense that we should engage comprehensively with a continent of nearly one billion people that comprises more than 50 countries. Importantly, witnesses to the inquiry emphasised that the 53 countries of Africa are extremely diverse and should not be considered as a homogeneous group of nations.

A witness to the inquiry, Mr David Wheen, argued that by extending the program to include African countries like Rwanda, recipient countries could achieve considerable gain with a minimal increase in spending on Australia‘s part. He noted that this would make a real contribution in enhancing the quality of public administration and that there are Australians, including retired businesspeople and public servants, with the skills and willingness to become involved.

The committee also recommended that the government work with the mining industry to promote corporate social responsibility and to continue to promote the extractive industry's transparency initiative, or

One witness, Dr David Lucas, commented that Australian universities did not specifically identify scholars engaged with Africa or highlight courses or projects in this area. Indeed, they appeared to be less than fully aware of such work being done within their own establishments. Other academics pointed to the lack of an Africa specific focus in relevant topics available to tertiary students and related observations touched on issues including the absence of dedicated academic appointments in the area, the closure of the only dedicated African research institute and an absence of jobs for African experts in Australia, whether in universities or in government. This is in sharp contrast to countries like the UK, the US, France, Canada and China, all of which have a strong African studies focus.

It is hoped that this will be the conduit for increased interaction between Australian parliamentarians and African parliamentarians, diplomats and others with an interest in Africa from across the spectrum of business, academia and civil society—including African migrant communities in Australia and NGOs that have significant operations in Africa.

But I hope that persons in this place and within the Australian community will have a chance to read the committee's report. In conclusion, I want to thank the chair of the committee, Senator Michael Forshaw, who took a great deal of interest and pride in this inquiry as the last one completed by the committee prior to his retirement from the Senate. I also thank my fellow committee members, especially Senator Russell Trood, who has been the distinguished and knowledgeable deputy chair of the Australia-UN Parliamentary Group since its establishment in early 2009 and who is now also retired from the Senate. Furthermore, I wish to thank the hardworking secretariat—in particular the secretary,

Finally, I wish to thank all of those people and organisations who made a submission, those who appeared in person before the committee and the individuals and organisations that the committee delegation met in Africa. It is through these contacts and on the basis of the information provided in the many submissions to this inquiry that the committee has been able to come up with a report that advances our understanding of Australia's relationships with the countries and peoples of Africa and that makes strategic and forward-looking recommendations which will, if adopted, enhance these relationships.

The inquiry commenced in late October 2009. Elections obviously intervened and so we did not finally have this report until June 2011, but it has been delivered at a time when Australian-African relationships are even more important than they were more than two years ago. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquired into the bilateral relations; economic, trade and investment issues; cultural, scientific and educational relations and exchanges; development assistance; cooperation; capacity building; defence cooperation; regional security and strategic issues; migration; and human rights issues.

It did take a very long time. There were the submissions taken in Australia, and we need to acknowledge the generosity of members of the public, institutions and non-government organisations who came forward and very carefully forwarded their thoughts and made their recommendations in an inquiry like this. But, as well, in April 2011 a small committee delegation travelled to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Ethiopia. I was very fortunate to be amongst that small group. We were able to visit and be briefed on a number of Australian aid projects. We met with parliamentarians in those four countries. We heard firsthand of their challenges. We heard of their very keen interest in forming a friendship group, particularly with members of parliament in Ghana. We were briefed by our ambassadors, by our Australian

Since then the issues of Africa have tended to slip from the minds of consecutive governments, but at no time were Africa and Africa's countries completely out of mind for many of Australia's faith based and other non-government organisations. So it came as no surprise to me to find that Australia's aid to Africa amounted to some $184 million—that is, AusAID managed aid—in 2008-09, while our Australia

Africa has about one billion people, compared to Australia's 22 million or so. It consists of 53 countries, and over the last 10 years we have seen an average of five to six per cent growth per year over those 53 countries. At the same time, though, we need to be reminded that, while many of those African countries are rich in natural resources, it is most unlikely that they will achieve the

It is a sad thing to observe almost a feeding frenzy in parts of Africa as more developed nations, particularly those wanting to lock in their own food security for years to come, are buying up arable land and fisheries and exploiting the mineral wealth of Africa, sometimes without putting much effort into technology transfer or building the capacity of those who work for them in extracting that mineral wealth to be sent offshore.

Their policy of employment in the goldmining company and processing works was to make sure, as much as possible, that they employed local people, trained those local people and were closely in touch with the local African leadership. We met with those men, and I was proud to think that this was an Australian owned goldmining company. But, not very far from their activity, there was an enormous amount of illegal mining activity being undertaken by, in this case, China nationals.

It impressed me that there was also an enormous potential to develop irrigation, particularly irrigated agriculture, in that country. They have significant water resources and dammed water resources. So we have enormous potential, given our expertise in irrigation system building and irrigation management, to help some of these African nations to make sure they do not make the sorts of mistakes we have made over centuries in Australia with irrigation and water management. They need to maximise their own water resources and their arable land so they can better feed themselves.

We do not have any posts in francophone Africa at the moment. We recommend that honorary consuls should be appointed as a short- to medium-term measure. Honorary consuls can go a long way towards filling the gap and meeting the needs of Australia's representation in countries where it is still not possible to put formal or full-time diplomatic representation. A number of our very excellent ambassadors and high commissioners must cover a number of countries, and that means in some cases only visiting one of the countries they are responsible for once or twice a year. Clearly that is not very satisfactory.

These are the kinds of people who are likely to have migrated to Australia under our skilled migration categories, when of course their home countries need their professional training, their expertise, much more than we do, you could argue.

She works at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. She now has mentored the establishment of a midwifery training college, again in Addis Ababa, called the Hamlin College of Midwives. At the college they are trying to ensure that their own country's young women, mostly those from regional parts of Ethiopia, are being trained in modern midwifery. When I talked to them about the opportunity for their coming to Australia for a time to do an exchange or to study, the Australian women managing that college were most concerned that it could be a distraction rather than a help. The women needed to train in their home country and develop their professional careers in their home country well before they took any trips out of that country and saw other conditions and opportunities.

She is an inspiration to all of us. Clearly, in countries like Ethiopia the poverty, the nutritional problems and the age at which young girls are having their first pregnancy all combine to make the rate of injury and deaths of young women during delivery, and of the babies themselves, a significant problem for that country.

The young children sit under a tree or in the shade somewhere. If you do not have a desk or a chair it becomes very difficult to manage paper when you are trying to learn to write. So, lap desks have been developed by a private South African country. They consist of a boomerang shaped plastic tray that sits on the knees of children as they sit on the ground or in a chair. The lap desks serve as a writing surface for the children. It means that they can in fact progress in the same way as other students throughout the world who have a desk or some furniture in their classroom. It is great that the Australian government has funded some 22,000 lap desks. They have been distributed to children in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is a very simple technology, but we do not understand the need until we go to these countries and see the lack of facilities that we take for granted. It becomes obvious that a small boomerang shaped plastic tray can mean the difference between a child easily being able to learn to write and not being able to learn at all.

The problem is that the households in those settlements wash their dishes with sand rather than washing detergent. The sand goes into the system and blocks up the works. There has been an enormous amount of effort to help the settlements in the Sabon Zongo urban slum in Accra to once again have running water and not have a system so contaminated and blocked that cholera is a problem. Even though the work was being done by a small fergie tractor—one we would not have seen in Australia for many years—it was still an inspiration to see how much progress was being made. We also saw the repairing of the city sewerage system by the city council in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.

Boys and girls were supposed to go to this school but, because there were no toilets at the school for the 900 students, girls did not attend. With Australian aid toilets were built for the school. Girls were then able to attend the school and have access to a toilet. It is a very simple thing—toilets for girls and boys—and suddenly you had 900 students able to access education whereas before only half the local school population attended. We went there on a school holiday and the students had turned out in their school uniforms to greet us, armed with their brushes and dusters to demonstrate how well they were minding and cleaning these new toilets. I have to say that it was a proud moment for me. Building toilets for a school might be a simple technology, but the need was great and Australia was able to step up and do the task. I think that a hand of friendship needs to be extended from Australia to the countries in Africa which are resource-rich and have enormous potential by developing their own human capital. We now have a number of African migrants but also many refugees, particularly in my own community in Murray. We have many Sudanese, Congolese and Somalians. They are all making a major contribution to our economy already but, more importantly, to our cultural life. We feel rich with the

One of their number, Immaculate, has already run for local council, although not successfully. That is the spirit of the people of Africa.

It was a terrible tragedy that indelibly scarred the psyche of this nation and reached out through the images on our television screens and portrayed in our newspapers to touch the hearts and minds of Australians right around the country. As I said on that day, the lives of those lost were and remain as precious as our own. Though more than six months have since passed, the events linger with clarity in the minds of those who deal with these matters on a very regular basis but especially in the minds of those who were involved in the rescue and who were called into action in that desperate hour.

The committee found that, given the terrible circumstances—namely, the ferocity of the foul weather that day—there was precious little that anything or anyone could have done differently to change that terrible outcome. It hardly bears thinking of but circumstances could certainly have been even bleaker. Had the boat arrived merely an hour earlier or one kilometre up the coast, there could have been no survivors. I think it is an absolute miracle that lives were saved at all on this occasion.

It is a long way from our mainland and oftentimes, I suspect, those who live on Christmas Island feel a long way from Australia. But on that day they showed the bravery, courage and empathy that Australians are known for around the world. On that day we could not have felt closer to them as fellow Australians and we stood with them in their sorrow and their grief but also we were incredibly proud of the way that our fellow Australians on Christmas Island conducted themselves on that day and the many days that have since followed. The bodies of 30 men, women and children were recovered. Another 20 were missing and presumed dead, and they rest beneath the waves. On that fateful day, the weather off Christmas Island was the worst it had been in the living memory of many locals: 40-knot winds, thunderstorms, and ebbing and pitching waves of three to four metres.

These sheer and ragged cliffs are basically the first things that the waves hit, with very little to impede their force as they wash across that sea. The conditions on that day rarely occur with that level of ferocity. But even on a still day you can see just how bad it could become in the worst set of conditions. Visibility was poor—you could barely see further than a rugby league field. And at the mercy of those churning seas, there was this wooden boat.

Naval and Customs officers were instructed to do all they could to help those in serious distress, and they did—above and beyond the call of duty. For many of those men and women, I suspect that this was a day on which they performed duties which they probably felt they had been called into naval service to one day potentially perform, and on that day they did not let down their oath, their service, their friends or those who had gone before them in these roles, and most of all they did not let down those who they had been sent to save.

They threw life jackets into the water as the boat was dashed against the ragged coastline and people were hurled into the sea. Those on shore risked slipping on the sharp, uneven rocks into deep ravines; nevertheless, 'They tried their best to haul people out of the water with ropes tied to life jackets on those struggling to survive a few metres away.' There is only one word appropriate to describe the efforts of those who rendered assistance on that bleak morning, and the report uses it: 'herculean'.

As my colleague the member for Stirling remarked, without the rescuers there is no question that those 42 people would have perished along with the other 50 lives that were lost.

It is vital that we acknowledge that here in this place and that those who were involved on that day understand that that is the finding of this report and that that is the view of this parliament. They need to cling to that. They need to know that this place and the members who represent Australians all around this country understand that that was the case. They can have great assurance that on that day they did all they could. There is no surveillance system available to the Australian government that is able to detect wooden hulled boats in such violent seas. The committee examined this extensively and found the intelligence community did all they could, based on the information they had, in relation to the arrival of SIEV221. The inquiry also spoke extensively to the people on the island who had responded. The report notes that many residents may retain horrific images in their memories—I have no doubt—and will grapple with questions and issues which are immensely difficult to cope with. That is why the inquiry recommends the provision of ongoing support not only to survivors but also to rescuers. Our hearts go out to them because these nightmares may remain not only immediately afterwards but also 12 months, five years or 10 years down the track.

This is not the first time that the tragedy of people being lost at sea has occurred in the sea lane between Indonesia and Christmas Island. We are aware—and there is credible evidence to suggest—that many other vessels that have left Indonesia have also gone off the radar and vanished somewhere in those millions of square nautical miles of water. Most recently, we are aware that a vessel departed a little more than six months ago with 91 people on board. Those people have never been heard of again. There will be no reports into what happened to them. There will be no inquiries. There will be no memorials. There will be none of that. But their loss is just as significant and relevant to the people here in this place who make decisions on these matters. And I remember another incident about two years ago when 109 people, all Afghans, left Indonesia on a vessel and were never heard of again. So I think we can say with some certainty that hundreds of people have lost their lives. It is our earnest hope that we will lose no more lives, and we need to do all we can to ensure that that is the outcome. No-one in this place would willingly endanger the lives of another, and members of this inquiry were profoundly affected by what they witnessed.

I think the most significant thing we must do is accept that, at the very least, in our participation in this debate there would be no-one in this place who wants to see harm come to anyone. We would hope that we endeavour to do what is in our national interest in addressing these matters and are very mindful of the moral issues that weigh heavily on officers who participate regularly in these issues.

I found their conduct over the course of those very, very difficult days to be outstanding. The minister was very open to our questions and ensured that we were able to get information quickly. In the most disappointing and upsetting of circumstances, that was the one thing where I thought those two ministers in particular engaged with members of the opposition and other members of this place in a very positive and responsible way. I thank them, on behalf of the opposition, for that. Briefings were made available through departmental officials—particularly Mr Carmody from the Customs and Border Protection Service—in circumstances where they had to deal with an unfolding situation. They made themselves available, and we sought not to detain them for long. The key message we sent to them at the time was to let every single one of the persons serving on behalf of the Australian government know that the people in this place were supportive of them and that they should get about their business and not be thinking of what might happen afterwards. I am pleased that in the course of this report and this inquiry their actions have been validated, their integrity has been reinforced and, indeed, their courage has been praised—as it should be. Those who at the time wanted to make different comments about those individuals will, I think, regret that. This report has more than vindicated the actions of our various service men and women, whichever government department or Defence agency they serve. They have performed outstandingly, so I thank them for that. I thank the ministers, again, for the way they have handled this matter. I hope we will not stand here in this place having conducted another inquiry into something of this nature, but we cannot be sure of that. It should only redouble our efforts to ensure that we do not see that happen again.

It was certainly a tragic incident. Much of the evidence we took—the images we saw and the witnesses we heard from—really did bring home what a harrowing event it was. It really was quite challenging to the members of the committee, on a number of different levels. Hearing the evidence, reading the evidence and seeing the evidence in detail did bring home the loss of life and the fact that we must do everything we can to prevent such tragedies.

I think they both did a very good job in handing down a bipartisan report—a report that I think will reassure Australians about the nature of this tragedy and the events surrounding it. This is very important for the country, because these events obviously have some capacity to divide the nation, and it is very important that there be a bipartisan approach to dealing with and reporting on such a harrowing and tragic event.

All the evidence we heard showed Australians acting at their best in a very trying set of circumstances. I know all the members of the committee were really in awe of their efforts, their bravery and the many small and large sacrifices they made during the course of the tragedy, the response to it and the months after it.

We are indeed lucky that there was no Australian loss of life, and there was certainly some potential for that. There was great risk to our own countrymen. While we value every life, and we mourn those dead and missing, it did make me reflect on just how brave, how decent and how heroic those who protect our borders are and what a great job they do. I have many constituents who fly P3s out of Edinburgh. I had some idea of the vastness of the ocean and the challenges involved in border protection. But going to Christmas Island reinforced in my mind just how important their efforts are and just how honourable, decent and brave all those people are.

While the report notes some areas where some limited improvement could have been made—such as the grenade lifejackets and the like—it is inconceivable that we could have had a better effort made by all those involved. They responded very well. As other speakers have noted, if it had been a couple of hours earlier or a kilometre up or down the coast, it might well have been much worse. Indeed, the fact that we have 42 survivors is a tribute to all of those involved. They really did save lives that day.

But when they are described to you and when you go down and see Rocky Point you understand just how challenging and difficult that it was. The report outlines those weather conditions. Those weather conditions also had a great effect on radar. Radar is of fairly limited use in spotting wooden hulled boats at any point in time, particularly in vast oceans. One important role that this report has is to put into context radar's ability to identify the small wooden fishing boats that are used for people-smuggling purposes. It puts into context the limits of human intelligence and the surveillance of vast oceans. No matter what the effort, if boats depart they will always get through. There is no perfect set of intelligence, radar or surveillance that can prevent such tragedies. It is very important that people be aware of that.

Hearing the evidence was challenging. One thing that it brought home to me is just what a rancid trade people smuggling is. It preys on the hopes of people but it also preys on the misery of desperate people. It is a trade that plays Russian roulette with people's lives. It is also a trade that places in this circumstance our border protection forces at some risk of their lives and wellbeing. I do not think that it is a trade that is based on compassion. It is a trade that is based on greed and selfishness of the highest order. We must within the bounds of our domestic and international obligations and standards discourage this trade. It must be stopped because it can cost lives. That was the one thing I took away from being on the inquiry. We must do all we can to avert such tragedies, while acknowledging that this tragedy was a tragedy brought about by the terrible circumstances of that day.

My wife works in child protection and she is a shift worker who works in a 24-hour service, so she often comes home at 10 o'clock or midnight. She often wants to unpack the details of some horrific tale—never breaching confidentiality but just sometimes talking about the circumstances. Obviously, lying in bed at 11 o'clock at night or midnight, the last thing I want to do is talk about these horrible things that go on out in the world in Queensland. But having been in this inquiry I now have a much better insight into why maybe I should just listen and talk about these things. Sometimes you just need to unpack the horrors and work through them so that you can put your head on your pillow and think that it is a wonderful world rather than a world of horror. So, yes, it was a very confronting inquiry; that is for sure.

The cover of this report is very nondescript and it has a very nondescript title, but so much in this inquiry report belies the tragedy that unfolded. Even the map on page 79 of the report is just a plain map with arrows and a very black and white strip showing what actually occurred, but it belies the horror that did occur. The reality is that on 15 December 2010 the conditions on Christmas Island were absolutely atrocious—40-knot winds, thunderstorms and wave heights of three to four metres, with some of the waves coming through at around four to five or six metres, according to the people at

As the member for Wakefield indicated, people were very much at risk, and the lives of Christmas Island residents were saved. Some of them were so horrified by what they saw that they were willing to put their lives at risk—to the extent that, but for their being restrained, they would have lost their lives because the conditions were so horrible. People were being slammed into rocks—and they were very sharp rocks. It was a stark contrast to what it is like if you go down there on a calm day. As Mr

It was just a feeling of absolute hopelessness. It was like it was happening in slow motion. A wave would pick the boat up and almost hit the rocks and then go back again, and then finally it … exploded.

They were hurling them as far as they could into the water. Maybe if they had had grenade life jackets they would have been able to rescue more people. I point out the following: of the 42 people who survived, 41 had life jackets. So it is not very complicated: if you have life jackets in rough seas, there is more chance of surviving. I will mention the one survivor who did not have a life jacket in a minute. The reality is obviously that Australia will never have enough life jackets for all the people who want to come to Australia. There are 42 million displaced people in the world; we do not have enough life jackets for all of them. Obviously that is metaphorically speaking, but in this circumstance it was practically speaking, because the 30 people whose bodies were recovered and the 20 people who are missing obviously did not have life jackets. The people who were able to get life jackets either from the Navy or from the people on land did survive.

This was a boat where 50 people lost their lives right in front of Australian observers, but there are other boats that just disappear out there. They do not disappear off the radar, because, as we know, radar will not pick up a 20-metre-long—or 20-foot-long, some of them—wooden vessel. We need to do whatever we can. We need to regulate government policy to make sure that we prevent such tragedies from happening again. I am pleased to say that the foreign minister, the immigration minister and the Prime Minister are working on making sure that we have a policy that breaks the people-smuggler business model.

No-one who lives and works in the Murray-Darling Basin could have escaped the feeling and the passion that was released about 24 hours after the first draft of the guide to the plan hit the decks.

When they picked it up and looked at it, it was so tough on their communities in terms of the direction in which it was heading. It also demonstrated that the authority at that stage really had very little understanding of what life was like, what the investment landscape was like and what people's circumstances were and had perhaps relied on desktop studies, scientific input—models that really did not mean much in the real world—and created this document that caused so much angst.

Four additional members were co-opted onto the committee apart from its regular membership, because of course it still continues as the regional Australia committee in this parliament, and I was one of those members.

We had many hearings in Canberra. I should know the number of submissions we received, but it was in the many hundreds—over 700 at least. I tried to read as many of them as possible. We took our job very seriously. But we realised there was not much point if we all approached this committee from the perspective of the individual areas that we represent because we would simply have a myriad of different views hitting the table at the end. It was important, therefore, that we all agreed on the final recommendations. It took us quite a few days, locked up in a committee room in

Labor members, Liberal members, National Party members and the Independent chair came up with a set of recommendations that we all felt we could live with. And anyone who knows the politics of water knows how difficult that really is. We had members who represent the Lower Lakes and we had myself and the member for Riverina, who represent the biggest rice growers in the Basin. So if we could agree on something then surely that is something the government needs to take seriously, and I very much hope that they do.

He made reference to 'apparently divergent views' within the federal coalition on Menindee. He perhaps needs to take a look behind him because it was a little over two months ago that the water minister's colleague, the minister for regional Australia, gave indicative support for a $100,000 grant to help the Menindee Lakes apply to become an internationally important wetland and tourism area. The minister yesterday was remarking on a tweet I posted saying I was pleased to see the memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government effectively torn up with a view to being recreated later. That somehow pointed to these 'divergent views' within the coalition. But it really is essential for the future of the Menindee Lakes that we do not have this tit-for-tat argument. And as the local member who represents the lakes and represents Broken Hill, my perspective was that for my local community anything that trashes the future of the lakes, that does not look after them sufficiently, is going to be bad. There is nothing in coalition policy that suggests that. I do not think there is anything in government policy that suggests that either.

We will argue about the extent to which savings can be made there. There are four engineering options on the table and there are discussions around which one of those options will be the best one, that ultimately does save the water that can be saved in Menindee. I have always been supportive of the re-engineering of Menindee Lakes, so for the water minister to suggest that somehow I was not and therefore I was not aligned with coalition policy is disappointing.

Minister Katrina Hodgkinson's media release begins by reaffirming her commitment to investment in water-saving measures and environmental works in the Murray-Darling Basin. The main reason I welcomed the ending of the memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and New South Wales was because one of its key ingredients was Broken Hill's water supply. Sure there was the re-engineering of Menindee Lakes, which I have just talked about, but there was also a 'solution' for Broken Hill's water issues—that is, an underground aquifer. Anyone who has visited the area and not just done the desktop studies that Geoscience have done—I am probably being a bit unfair; they probably have visited the area, but I do not think they have taken much in—would know that to cut off Broken Hill from the Menindee Lakes as its permanent water supply and to instead suggest that it gets its water from an underground aquifer, the science of which is still not decided, and that the people in the far west should be happy with that is quite patently ridiculous.

It was cobbled together in a hurry and it certainly is a good thing that it is now finished. However, I stand behind coalition policy, which does recognise the need to re-engineer Menindee Lakes and does say that we need a discussion about how that happens and does say that we need an agreement that every user in the basin can be happy with. I was disappointed that the water minister trivialised the issue to such an extent yesterday, because he is actually the one who is tasked with sorting this problem out. He has a set of recommendations in front of him which were made by a group of members of parliament from all sides. Those recommendations are quite sensible and have been well received by the communities. So I would ask the minister to actually focus on that and not the trivial politicising of the issue. I do not think people want to see a water minister trying to wedge the states against each other in a bid to cover up the lack of action and a completely botched report by the authority that he is supposed to administer. Let's face it, that is what happened. So, instead of spending their good time monitoring my Twitter account, perhaps the minister and his staff would be better off actually reading the report thoroughly and implementing some of the well-constructed and fully researched views of the Australian people, whom they claim to represent.

It is much more responsive to communities, much more interested in what they think and certainly much more willing to take on the ideas of the communities. When you live in a regional area you do not see a lot of the activity happening in Canberra that relates to you. There is nothing worse than relying on models, bureaucratic studies and desktop studies by institutions in Canberra that do not ask for your input, use their own ideas and think they know what is best. That is why it is so important that Craig Knowles spend some time among basin communities. He has done that. I commend him for it and I am delighted that he has.

We should not just confine it to what happens in terms of dollars saved per megalitre of water. And we all know how we could do that most cheaply. We could wait for the market to be where it is now and go in and buy out stressed sellers. But we should not be doing that.

One of our first recommendations was that we stop non-strategic buybacks—in other words, that we listen to the communities and take on their ideas. People come to us with ideas about how we could better save water—I have a significant one in the lower Murrumbidgee in my electorate and there are many others. The communities are saying, 'If this is what you want to do let us show you the way.' A Swiss cheese type buyback that just sees water bought from all over the place in a patchwork sense leaves communities decimated as a result. It is actually not necessary. You can achieve the same result in a much more strategic way if you apply what is not much more than basic common sense.

We all have our favourite towns in our electorate. The 2½ days we spent in Deniliquin were very special to me, as was the time in Menindee and Broken Hill and in Mildura and Wentworth, where we saw the significance of the junctions of the Murray and Darling rivers and quite a different type of agriculture from that of the general water security users further upstream. We also went to

The heartache, distress and concern on the faces and in the voices of the people who spoke to us made me realise how important our task was. I can remember people one after the other, in the chance that they had at the end of the meeting, standing up and saying in just 1½ minutes how they felt. That meant more to us than a ream of carefully constructed arguments, to be honest. People said that they were not farming in order to survive and that they were sick of governments saying to them, 'What do you need in order to survive?' One woman said to us: 'We do not want to survive; we want to thrive; we want to have something to pass on to future generations; we want to do something that's meaningful. We have a history here; we can remember how our forefathers developed the area, digging irrigation ditches with a shovel. We can remember how the horse drawn carts were involved; we have the pictures in our homesteads. This is something that matters a great deal to us in terms of our heritage. And you people from Canberra'—as they said to us—'just do not get it, do you? You want to come down here and tell us what we need in order to survive, and it is just not about that.' Many indicated that they were not going to give up what they had worked so hard for without a fight.

But that was not really the argument; that was not really the perspective that they were coming from. They had just reached a point of exhaustion and distress and had no other way of expressing themselves. I thank everyone who stepped up and talked and poured out their heart and soul or wrote us submissions and say to them that this was an example of their voices being heard—they really were. Everything that they said mattered.

She did a fantastic job in supporting our work.

The Government acted on some of the AFTS review recommendations and ruled out some recommendations that were inconsistent with our policy priorities.

A number of the recommendations in the AFTS report require further community debate, which is why the Government will hold a public tax forum in October to continue the national conversation on tax reform that we started with the release of the report.
