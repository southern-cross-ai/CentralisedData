       <p>
        I present the Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 13 (2013-2014)—Australian Intelligence Agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I would now like to turn to the second report of the committee. The committee has today fulfilled one of its key statutory oversight responsibilities with the tabling of its report into the review of administration and expenditure of the Australian Intelligence Agencies for the 2013-2014 financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to report that the committee concluded that agencies are currently overseeing their administration and expenditure appropriately.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a number of years now, the committee has monitored the impact of the efficiency dividend and other savings measures on agencies. In this review, the committee sought assurances that each agency continues to have the necessary resources to address Australia's national security priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        While outside the review period, recent increases to the ongoing funding of intelligence agencies and the Office of National Assessment's exemption from the efficiency dividend, help allay the committee's concerns that agencies are at the point of being unable to find further efficiencies without affecting ongoing capability or operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee will monitor the effect of these funding decisions in its future reviews.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both these inquiries have taken place at a time when Australia is facing a heightened security environment. A major reason for the increased threat level is Australians travelling overseas to train with, fight for or otherwise support extremist groups, and the risks posed by these individuals when they return to Australia. In considering the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill and conducting its annual review of the intelligence agencies, the committee has sought to ensure that these agencies have the tools and resources they require to support our national security and law enforcement capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take a brief moment to thank the secretariat for their ongoing hard work. When it comes to the work of the committee, we have obviously faced a significant workload in this term of parliament and the professionalism and the dedication that the secretariat has shown throughout that process is to be commended. I commend the report to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a parliamentary paper.
