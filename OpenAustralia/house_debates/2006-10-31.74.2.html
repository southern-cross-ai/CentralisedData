       <p>
        I rise to speak on a remarkable achievement in my electorate of Stirling regarding Australian apprenticeships. There has been a marked increase in the number of young people learning the vital skills that my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        will need to sustain its unprecedented growth and lock in future prosperity. Since the Howard government was elected, the number of people training under Australian apprenticeships in Stirling has risen from 1,400 in March 1996 to over 3,000 in March 2006. This is an increase of 1,630 people learning vital skills in traditional trades, as well as trainees across our many local industries. It constitutes a 116 per cent increase in Australian apprenticeship training in my local area, a very welcome figure for the people of Stirling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently released figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research showed that there were 403,000 Australian apprentices in training in the March quarter of 2006, which is a 161 per cent increase since the coalition was elected in 1996. This is further proof that the Howard government’s initiatives and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        changes are encouraging people to seize training opportunities, particularly in the trades. Anyone who wants to learn a trade can now access the many opportunities the Australian government is providing to help them obtain marketable skills to contribute to our vibrant economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is delivering a range of initiatives during 2006 and through to 2009 as part of a $10.8 billion investment in Australia’s future, the biggest ever commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia’s history. This includes the Tools for Your Trade Initiative, which allows many Australian apprentices who started after 1 July to receive a tool kit to the value of up to $800. This initiative greatly benefits our local trade industry, and I am confident that many local employers and Australian apprentices will participate in the Tools for Your Trade Initiative, allowing many of our apprentices to achieve a financial head start in their new careers. When eligible Australian apprentices have completed three years of training, a voucher will be provided to their employer to purchase a tool kit. The Australian apprentice can keep the kit upon completion of a further six months of training. This very important initiative is one of the many measures that the Australian government has introduced to assist in addressing areas of skills needs in the trades.
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of eligible Australian apprenticeships for the scheme includes apprentice welders, sheetmetal workers, motor mechanics, auto-electricians, panelbeaters, carpenters and joiners, chefs, bricklayers, plumbers and many more. In a booming state such as Western Australia, these many programs and initiatives are to be commended in helping our young people secure their own futures and secure the economic prosperity of all our local communities, particularly those in Stirling.
