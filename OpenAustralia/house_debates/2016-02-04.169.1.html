       <p>
        I take this opportunity to reflect on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        and citizenship. Australia Day is a day when we reflect on the values that make our country great and acknowledge the citizens that contribute to and define Australia's values. It may be said that the decision to make 26 January the commencement date of Australia's first citizenship legislation linked Australia Day with the concept of citizenship. Taking an oath or affirmation of citizenship is the ultimate expression of loyalty and commitment to this great nation of ours. We, as Australians, value our concept of citizenship, particularly our commitment and loyalty to our great nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians are trusting and compassionate by nature but perhaps too much so, to our detriment. Sadly, perhaps until recent world events, we have been somewhat complacent in thinking that all those who come to our shores share our values and beliefs and concept of citizenship.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek" rel="nofollow">
         The Greek
        </a>
        philosopher Aristotle once said of citizenship, 'It is not always the same thing to be a good man and a good citizen.' What Aristotle was referring to was that there is nothing virtuous in and of citizenship itself; rather it is what we do with it that counts. It is how we exercise our responsibilities as citizens to participate respectfully and considerately in public discussion and debate, always working towards the betterment of our great nation through service to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a rich history that has shaped our culture, our laws and our systems of governance, and our unified and harmonious society. Our country has been built on the combined contributions of our Indigenous people and those who came later from across the world. No-one would ever dispute that Australia is truly the lucky country, but not for one moment should we ever consider that our great nation was born from luck. Since the arrival of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet" rel="nofollow">
         First Fleet
        </a>
        in 1788, consisting of around 1,330 people, our nation and her people have endured famine and adversity, but through iron will and determination our nation prospered. The foundation of the Australian culture and all that we value about being an Australian lies with the tenacity of the contribution of our forefathers—the convicts, marines, free settlers, migrants and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        . Now as then, as citizens of this wonderful land we should never take this great nation of ours for granted. Citizenship is a public commitment to embrace Australian values and institutions and brings with it certain responsibilities and privileges, such as the right to vote and access to an Australian passport. Citizenship also brings with it civil and social rights, especially the right to express cultural heritage and beliefs, as well as the responsibility to accept the rights of others to express their heritage and beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are proudly a multicultural society that is vibrant, colourful, tolerant and cohesive. Australia and its people are defined by their defence of freedom, democracy, tolerance, a fair go and, importantly, mateship. As Australians, we live within and are protected by a strong justice system. We embrace living in harmony and peacefulness in our local and national communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is well known as a land of opportunity, and we certainly do have boundless opportunities to live and grow and raise a family in a free and open society, without fear of oppression, systemic violence or censorship. As Australian citizens, we should all share in the common good and the bounty of our great land. In return for the honour of being an Australian, we owe Australia and our fellow Australians our duty to be good neighbours and good citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        As collective members of our inclusive Australian society, citizenship is a demonstration of our commitment to honour and respect one another and to uphold our democratic beliefs, rights and liberties. For those coming to our shores, we welcome you to participate in our way of life, our culture and our values. But only through sharing the same values and respect for Australia will we continue to thrive and our nation remain strong and secure. All our great nation asks for in return is mutual respect—respect for our way of life, respect for fellow Australians, respect for other religions, respect of our past and respect for the contribution of Indigenous Australians—and together we will create a thriving, strong, secure and prosperous Australia that is and always will be a land of opportunity for all.
