        As we draw towards the end of another Australian summer, I commend the efforts of Surf Life Saving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . Surf Life Saving Central Coast and its volunteers have been working tirelessly over the recent months to ensure that locals and tourists alike have a safe and enjoyable time on Central Coast beaches. You would be hard-pressed to find a more iconic representation of the Australian summer than our volunteer surf-lifesaving movement. Since its establishment in the 1870s, surf-lifesaving has grown across Australia to now include over 100,000 members from 256 clubs. Surf-lifesaving is etched into our national fabric.

        Founded in 1938, Surf Life Saving Central Coast covers the coast from

        </a>
        when the clubs on the Central Coast saw significant growth, expanding from the five foundation clubs to today's total of 15. My electorate of Dobell is home to six of these surf-lifesaving clubs: Wamberal;

        ; and Soldiers Beach. Each conducts a magnificent job on our local beaches. During the current season there were an estimated 1.3 million individual visits to Central Coast beaches. In the 2012-13 patrol season, Surf Life Saving Central Coast conducted 555 rescues, 25,259 preventative actions and 2,822 first aids and provided 95,843 volunteer hours.

        This summer has been particularly significant for the organisation as they celebrate their 75th anniversary. I was honoured to attend the 75th anniversary gala dinner last October, where I presented a letter of congratulations on behalf of the Prime Minister. The evening offered a unique opportunity to reflect on the many achievements of Surf Life Saving Central Coast. Since recordkeeping formally commenced in 1977, some 33,889 lives have been saved by Surf Life Saving Central Coast. Over the years Surf Life Saving Central Coast has pioneered many initiatives implemented Australia wide, including the formation of the first rescue helicopter services. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s The Entrance, Terrigal and

        were home to the leading power surf rescue divisions in Australia. Surf Life Saving Central Coast was instrumental in establishing the nippers movement along with the community education program. In 1988 Surf Life Saving Central Coast had the honour of hosting

        Special mention must be made of the outstanding commitment made by President Mr Stuart Harvey and

        Mr Chris Parker, who with their staff and directors ensure beachgoers receive an extremely high standard of care. May I conclude by again thanking and acknowledging Surf Life Saving Central Coast, all surf-lifesaving clubs and the thousands of volunteers for their ongoing commitment and outstanding effort over this current summer.
