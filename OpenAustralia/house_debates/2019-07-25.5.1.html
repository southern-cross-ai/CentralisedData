       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliament passed the 2019-20 supply bills before the election to facilitate the continuation of normal government business through until the end of November (around the end of the spring parliamentary sittings). At the same time, for transparency about funding for the balance of the year, we also introduced annual appropriation bills for scrutiny by the estimates committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following convention, the pre-election version of the annual appropriation bills then lapsed when the parliament was prorogued.
       </p>
       <p>
        The re-introduced
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 1) 2019-2020, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2019-2020and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, form the principal bills underpinning the government's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bills are substantively the same as the bills of the same names that were introduced into the previous parliament in April this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minor changes have been made between the pre-election and post-election versions of these annual appropriation bills to reflect new machinery-of-government changes resulting from the Administrative Arrangements Order and new decisions made since the 2019-20 budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of approximately $58.4 billion. The provisions in the bill seek authority for appropriations broadly equivalent to seven-twelfths of the 2019-20 annual appropriations and other measures. Together with the Supply Act (No.1) 2019-2020, this bill provides appropriations for the ordinary annual services of government for the full year of 2019-20.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now outline the significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

Included in this amount is funding to support ongoing major Defence operations, including operations OKRA, ACCORDION, HIGHROAD, RESOLUTE and MANITOU.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        will receive approximately $6.3 billion to continue to strengthen health services for all Australians. This will include funding for: new medical research, including administration of the Medical Research Future Fund; better mental health and drug and alcohol support services, including the expansion of the national headspace network; further support for improved access to quality of aged-care, residential and home care services; and workforce priorities, improved access to medicines and implementing the Sport 2030 National Sport Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will receive just under $5.6 billion, including funding for the Commonwealth's contribution to the fourth action plan to prevent violence against women and their children, the expansion of the cashless debit card to tackle drug, alcohol and gambling misuse, and the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

       </p>

        Fourth, the

        </a>
        will receive just under $3.2 billion to advance Australia's international strategic, security and economic interests and to manage and distribute Australia's official development assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifth, Services Australia will receive just under $2.7 billion to support individuals, families and communities to achieve greater self-sufficiency; and providers and businesses through convenient and efficient service delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sixth, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        will receive just under $2.5 billion, which includes funding for national security, the management of noncitizens within onshore and offshore detention, facilitation of people and goods across the border, and the provision of refugee and humanitarian assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        will receive just over $2.1 billion to manage Australia's taxation and superannuation systems, including through helping people understand their rights and obligations, improving ease of compliance and access to benefits, and managing noncompliance with the law. In particular, the bill contains funding for the continuation of the corporate Tax Avoidance Taskforce and the expansion of Single Touch Payroll.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the 2019-20 portfolio budget statements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
