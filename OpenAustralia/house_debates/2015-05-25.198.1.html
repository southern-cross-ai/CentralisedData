       <p>
        I rise to speak about a local manufacturing business in my electorate of Swan, the Fero Group, which are a local family-owned business. The Fero Group are working hard to develop their business model and invest in the future growth of their business, which manufactures steel and anti-corrosion materials for the oil and gas, mining, civil, marine, commercial, industrial and residential industries. Last week I had the pleasure of meeting the organisation's founder, Mario, and his two sons, Michael and Robert Franco, and the chief financial officer, Len Troncone. I also managed to bump into one of my old footy mates, George Giannakis, who is now the organisation's group finance manager. So I can attest that the business is in good hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the great catch-up, this was not a social visit. It was to inform the Fero Group that they had been successful in receiving a $4.9 million grant under the government's Manufacturing Transition Program to advance their manufacturing capability, because this government recognised the future growth potential of this local organisation. Despite this grant funding, this is a business that is moving ahead. Overall this is a $23.95 million project that Fero Group is investing in to design and build a new state-of-the-art highly automated galvanising plant which will ensure it remains a competitive and sustainable business both domestically and globally.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thanks go to Mario, Michael and Robert for taking the time to show me around their impressive facility. I will be looking forward to returning in the near future when works are completed to once again highlight how manufacturing businesses such as this are working to generate growth, employment and industry sustainability.
