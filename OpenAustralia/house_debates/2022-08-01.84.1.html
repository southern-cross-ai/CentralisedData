        My question is to the Minister for

         Climate Change

        and Energy. What action is the Albanese Labor government taking to put more energy into the grid for Australian households? Why is it so important to be upfront on the issues facing the energy system, and what are the consequences of a failure to act?

         I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. She, together with her other

          Hunter Valley
         </a>
         colleagues, represents an area which has been crucial to Australia's energy generation and will continue to be so as we move Australia to become a renewable energy powerhouse. No region will be more important than the Hunter in that transformation. Getting more energy generation and more electricity generation is the centrepiece of the Albanese government's approach. We have Rewiring the Nation, which will ensure that we can transition to 82 per cent renewables in the system, because cheap energy is also clean energy. Unfortunately, the former government opposed, and continues to oppose, this investment in transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have our national energy transformation partnership with the states and territories, which we are negotiating and working on in good faith with our state and territory colleagues. It is very important. I know the previous minister for energy would not have been willing or able to do this. Of course, we also have our important community batteries policy and solar banks policy, to bring on new renewables and to bring on the storage.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I'm asked about the consequences of a failure to act. That, really, is what we're dealing with: the consequences of 10 years of delay, denial and dishonesty. There are four un-fun facts about the previous government's approach. We know that, under the previous government—

            It goes to the question of the extent to which ministers are given free rein to simply give their own interpretation of what's happened over the last 10 years.

           <p>
            The point of order, brainiac, is relevance! Standing order 98(c) is quite clear on the range of topics that ministers can be asked about. It is restricted to public affairs, administration and proceedings pending in the House. Then, of course, there's the well-understood requirement that an answer must be directly relevant to the question. It cannot be appropriate that there's a construct under which a minister is asked a question which invites them to reflect in the broadest possible terms on the conduct of the previous government. He should be telling the Australian people what the Albanese government's plans are to solve the problem.

              On the point of order: for the benefit of the Manager of Opposition Business, standing order 98, which he referred to at the start, carries the rules for the questions. They apply to the questioner.
              <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=3" title="An answer must be relevant to the question.    From...">
               Standing order 104
              </a>
              is the one that refers to the answers, and that's the standing order that refers to the minister. It's not a valid point of order to use standing order 98 to try to limit what's in an answer. This question specifically included 'What are the consequences of a failure to act?' and the minister is being specifically relevant to it.

               I understand the point being made, and this was a question put to me by the Manager of Opposition Business last Thursday. I'll continue to listen to both questions and answers carefully and enforce the standing orders. Answers must be directly relevant and within the parameters of the question. The question was about consequences of a failure to act. If that part of the question was not in the question, the minister would not be relevant. I'll make a ruling if I feel the answer is not relevant and outside the parameters of the question. I call the minister, who was being relevant to one part of the question.

               <p>
                Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I understand the sensitivity of those opposite about the four un-fun facts of their record. The first un-fun fact is that in their time we had four gigawatts of energy generation leave the system and only one gigawatt of energy generation come on, because the previous government did not encourage renewable energy generation. We saw a 17 per cent decline in renewable energy generation over their period. Second, is that the previous minister announced a billion dollars of funding to get 3,800 megawatts onto the system and didn't deliver a gigawatt, a megawatt, a watt or an electron. Not one. Third, their signature policy, Snowy 2.0—we heard a lot about it. Good project. Did anybody in the House hear the minister come to the dispatch box before the election and announce it was running 18 months late? I might've missed it! Anyone? No. I don't think it came up. It wasn't mentioned. Finally, the result of their delay and denial was the dishonesty: the minister changing the law so he would not be held to account for his actions, citing an instrument to keep the facts from the Australian people. That's what the previous minister did. We are dealing with the implications of a Taylor-made crisis and we're fixing the mess we inherited.
