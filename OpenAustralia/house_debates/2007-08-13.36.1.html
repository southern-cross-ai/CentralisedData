       <p>
        On Saturday, 4 August the Tea Tree Gully Golf Club in my electorate of Makin celebrated its 75th anniversary at a special anniversary dinner. I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere congratulations to all members of the club and especially acknowledge the President, Mr Brenton Burford; the Manager, Mr Dean Stanton; and the members of the board, who do such a tremendous job. The Tea Tree Gully Golf Club are the largest golf club in the Makin electorate. They provide outstanding facilities and an extremely well manicured course for the benefit and enjoyment of their members. Golf, as we all know, is an amazingly popular sport, especially for our older Australians, who take the opportunity post retirement to compete or play socially, gaining valuable exercise and community interaction.
       </p>

        I recently had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the excellent work of the club through the Australian government’s Community Water Grants. In round 2 of the Community Water Grants announced late last year, the Tea Tree Gully Golf Club were successful in obtaining assistance to the tune of $45,000 to pursue important work on their aquifer storage and recharge system and implement amazing water-saving measures. In round 3 I have been delighted to support their further application, which again seeks to save our most important natural resource—that is, our water. The commitment of the Tea Tree Gully Golf Club to the environment and to their members has been demonstrated by their ability to reach 75 years of age, and I sincerely hope they remain a viable sporting facility for a great number of years.
