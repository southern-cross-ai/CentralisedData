        When I am out there in the community—whether it be hosting street corner meetings or community meetings, door knocking, or attending local events—jobs and the future of our country, and of my state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , are topics that are frequently raised with me. I want to assure those out there in South Australia and my local electorate of Hindmarsh who are concerned about these issue: the federal government and I are committed to helping job seekers to a better future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past two years, since the coalition government was elected, over 300,000 jobs have been created across Australia. South Australia, however, has unfortunately not been experiencing the same growth. I understand that manufacturing is declining, the mining resource boom is slowing down and job uncertainty is becoming more of a challenge in South Australia. Our year 12 students who are undertaking their final exams are thinking about their future and whether their chosen path will lead to a job and a sustainable career.

        economy in both the public and private sectors, I have a strong commitment to the future of our state. This is why I recently hosted a forum on jobs in the economy with the Minister for Education,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Birmingham
        </a>
        , at the West Lakes Sports Club to generate a healthy and open discussion in my local community about jobs growth and opportunity. I also welcomed Sally Neville, from Restaurant &amp; Catering Australia; Rick Cairney from Business

        </a>
        —industry leaders in South Australia—to join the conversation. I would like to thank Sally, Rick and Michael for their involvement and efforts in making the forum successful. The large number of local residents who attended heard how there are opportunities out there. Yes, there are challenges, but there are promising signs in some areas—such as the hospitality and restaurant sector, where there is an ongoing job shortage, and our tourism sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the stories of success at the forum was that of a young juggler who quit her job at Cirque du Soleil in Montreal because it was too cold and has since started two businesses in Adelaide. This young entrepreneur has acknowledged her strengths and is now looking to expand and to hire staff—economic activity and business growth that is good South Australia. This is just one of the many great stories I have come across. Visiting local businesses, I am always impressed by the number of companies that did not exist 20 years ago but are now successful and talking optimistically about expanding and employing people. The one thing that large businesses have in common is that they all started as small businesses.

        South Australia has had some major wins in recent times and we are living in exciting times, with the growing middle class of Asia on our doorstep. Important projects and initiatives that will help the future of our state include infrastructure projects such as the $1 billion Northern Connector and upgrade of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
         South Road
        </a>
        to improve the North-South Corridor, which have seen 1,000 jobs generated through construction work; around $30 million to advance manufacturers in South Australia, including Philmac at North Plimpton and Seeley, with their world leading air conditioners; and the commitment to Defence shipbuilding in Adelaide with the recent announcement to build patrol boats and frigates—2,500 more jobs—fast-tracking both programs in 2018 and 2020. I will continue to work for the future of our state, including the future submarines, and for a better future.
