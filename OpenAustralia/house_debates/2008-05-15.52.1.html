         I thank the member for Moreton for his question. A responsible question about government policy stands in stark contrast to the performance of the Liberal Party, which obviously thinks question time is now for clutching bottles of alcohol and hurling over the dispatch box abuse about important social issues like binge drinking. I am sure the member for Moreton is also very interested to hear that the government’s Better Universities Renewal Fund will deliver to his local university,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
          Griffith University
         </a>
         , $16.2 million, an investment in a world-class education system—an education revolution. The government has to deliver an education revolution to make up for the more than a decade of neglect of our education system by the former government, by the Liberal Party and by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition when serving as ministers for education in that government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amongst our major initiatives in this budget is the Better Universities Renewal Fund to deliver $500 million to universities by the end of this financial year. But we are also creating the Education Investment Fund of $11 billion, a fund which will enable the renewal and renovation of both the higher education sector and the vocational education and training sector. These institutions have been allowed to languish as a result of more than a decade of neglect. The Education Investment Fund is composed of $6 billion coming from the former Higher Education Endowment Fund and a new investment of $5 billion. The money is all about improving higher education and vocational education and training.

         have criticised this fund, as they have criticised all of Labor’s investments in the future. But on these criticisms they show themselves to be out of touch with the thinking of those that care about the future of Australian education. In that regard, I refer to

             Phil Clark
            </a>
            —the board chairman appointed by the former government, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education—has welcomed the new broader endowment structure and the end to the inflexible reliance on earnings. He argues, as reported in the
            <i>

            :

            The $11 billion is good but the totally integrated framework (of the new fund) is the real winner; most people will miss that.

            Clearly, amongst the people who have missed that are the people sitting on the opposition benches, the members of the Liberal Party.

            He noted that we are ‘billions behind the rest of the world’. The flexible nature of the fund will obviously allow the government the discretion to provide funding where it is needed most.

             I understand that members of the Liberal Party are bored by education because they care nothing about it, and I understand that they are out of touch with the thinking of those that care about Australian education and its future. But these endorsements show that the education community understands that the Rudd Labor government, through its budget, is committed to the future of Australian education, committed to delivering an education revolution and committed to overcoming the legacy of neglect left by a decade of Liberal Party rule and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
