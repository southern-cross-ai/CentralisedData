       <p>
        I rise to draw the attention of the House to the passing of Wendy Jenkins, whose funeral took place in Melbourne this morning. I am very pleased that my friend the member for Chisholm was able to attend and to hear that it was a very fitting send-off. Hazel Eileen Jenkins, known as Wendy, made an extraordinary and indeed indelible contribution to the electorate of Scullin and to the Labor Party. While I only met her on a few occasions, and I do not presume to have known her well, it is important to acknowledge her achievements in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wendy was married to Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">

        , who represented the electorate of Scullin from 1969 to 1986, and was the mother of the representative who succeeded him, Harry Jenkins. I can only speculate as to her influence on their many parliamentary achievements, although I am aware of how proud she was of both of them. Her personal achievements deserve and warrant serious attention. Wendy was a life member of the Victorian Branch of the

        and was the first at many things—notably, the first woman on Whittlesea Shire and a real trailblazer in terms of women's involvement in the Labor Party, in Victoria and nationally. She famously stood up to Gough—the start of a friendship, I believe—and always stood up for social justice. She was very involved in the

        </a>
        and, until very recently, she was a delegate to the ALP's state conference, continuing her deep involvement at every level, going back to before intervention. She always put others first.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend all my best wishes to all of Wendy's family at this time and, in particular, to Harry and Michele. I know she will be greatly missed but always remembered.
