        Dedication, commitment and perseverance are fantastic attributes for any athlete. Most of us would agree that the top of the pinnacle is to represent Australia, and that is exactly what Goonellabah soccer player Kaiden Powell is doing. Last week, Kaiden was selected to play in the Australian Indigenous team against the

        team in the near future. The selectors cast their eye over an impressive pool of players representing 16 teams at the recent National Indigenous Football Championships in Nowra. The news had a double impact for Kaiden. He has also taken up a fantastic opportunity to play for the

        The 27-year-old aspires to reach the A-league or even play overseas if the cards fall the right way. He has climbed the ladder of success through his local club, the Hornets. It is one of the many teams that play in the popular far

        Today I would like to highlight the fantastic achievements of a Casino local, Karlee Whitton. Karlee is the mother of two young boys, a high school teacher, a trainer at Casino Boxing Club and an aspiring amateur boxer. She grew up watching her dad's passion as he trained boxers in the local gym, and is now extremely proud to have him standing in her corner. Last weekend, Karlee travelled to Cairns to take part in the Australian Amateur Boxing Titles. It was at these titles that Karlee achieved the first part of her dream: being crowned Australian Champion for both the flyweight and bantamweight sections. Karlee now has her sights set on fulfilling the second part of her dream: being selected for the Australian team to compete at the 2018
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I would like to congratulate Karlee for the success she has achieved over the weekend and, on behalf of our community, I would like to wish her all the very best in reaching her goal of representing Australia at the upcoming Commonwealth Games.
