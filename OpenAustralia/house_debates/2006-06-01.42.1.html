        My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on the training opportunities available to employees under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        . Are there any alternative policies?

         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         for his question. I note that the unemployment rate in his electorate of La Trobe is 3.7 per cent, due to the good economic management of this government. In response to his question, it is a fact that the members opposite and the union movement continue to persist with their misleading and ridiculous claims that people will not be able to receive the occupational health and safety training provided by unions. As I have pointed out in this place on a number of occasions, occupational health and safety remains a state and territory responsibility. It seems that the only person these days who does not believe that, and is incapable of understanding that, is the Leader of the Opposition. First, we had the email from the member for Lilley, acting on the advice of the member for Perth, which said that this training would continue to be provided. Then yesterday we had the collective agreement entered into by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Shorten
         </a>
         ’s union, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Workers Union
         </a>
         , which provided not only for occupational health and safety training but also that the workers would get paid leave to go and do that training.
        </p>
        <p>
         I came across some more information about this matter overnight in a document called the
         <i>
          SafetyNet Journal
         </i>
         . The
         <i>
          SafetyNet Journal
         </i>
         features in it each week a frequently asked question. This week’s question is quite interesting. The question is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Does the ‘
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorkChoices" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="italic">

         </a>
         rep’s course?
        </p>
        <p>
         The answer is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         No, it does not.
        </p>
        <p>
         It goes on to explain:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The changes to the Federal Workplace Relations Act (‘WorkChoices’) do
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" rel="nofollow">
          NOT
         </a>
         affect an OHS rep ... right to attend an initial/refresher course of their choice, including courses run by unions ...
        </p>
        <p>
         This is very interesting advice because the
         <i>
          SafetyNet Journal
         </i>
         is published by the

          Victorian Trades Hall
         </a>
         Council. If you go to the Victorian Trades Hall web site and look up this week’s question, you can get the answer to it. I note also that the journal says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If you have any questions or need help—
        </p>
        <p>
         the Leader of the Opposition might listen to this—

        <p class="italic">
         with any OHS related issue, Ask Renata.
        </p>
        <p>
         I suggest he give Renata a ring before he makes foolish comments in future. This ridiculous situation, which the Leader of the Opposition maintains, just shows that he and some of the unions will stoop to any lengths in order to make a political point, including recently making a political stunt out of the death of a worker, something about which

Isn’t it the case that in Mount Druitt there are nearly 600 employees employed in the retail industry on the relevant award or certified agreement who, if they work at Coles or Kmart and work the same hours as Mrs Harris, are $119 to $126 a week better off than those on the 2c an hour Spotlight AWA? Won’t the government’s industrial relations legislation force the other retailers in Mount Druitt to join the 2c an hour wages race to the bottom?
