        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government is building a stronger and more prosperous economy?

         I do thank the member for Mallee for his question. I cannot help but note he was a highly successful farmer before entering this parliament. As a successful farmer, he understands that stronger businesses are at the heart of a stronger economy. More than most in this chamber, he understands that you cannot have stronger communities without a strong economy to sustain them and you cannot have a strong economy without strong, successful and profitable private businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before the election and after the election, this government has been making absolutely crystal clear its fundamental objective to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. It is true that in recent months the focus has been on national security rather than economic security. But in the end, you cannot have one without the other. We cannot have stronger defence forces, stronger security services, let alone better funded social programs and better schools and hospitals; we cannot have any of these things, without a strong economy to sustain them.

         We promised that we would get rid of the carbon tax. The carbon tax is gone. We promised we would get rid of the mining tax. The mining tax is gone. We promised that we would build the roads of the 21st century and these roads are starting. We promised to get the budget back under control and step by, often, painful step in another place the budget is coming back under control. We promised that we would cut red tape and, so far, measures announced by this government will provide $2 billion in annual red tape cost reductions for Australian businesses. All of this is starting to deliver results for the businesses, the individuals and families of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The biggest fall in power prices on record thanks to the abolition of the carbon tax is now going to the consumers of Australia—the biggest fall in power prices on record. We have also provided environmental approvals for projects worth well over $800 billion—that is investment to secure the jobs of the future. We have finalised two out of three major free trade agreements—exports to secure the jobs of the future. As part of our competitiveness agenda, we are going to restore workable employee-share ownership plans—that is entrepreneurship to give us the jobs of the future. More profitable businesses lead to a stronger economy, to give us stronger and more cohesive communities and the happier families that every Australian wants.
