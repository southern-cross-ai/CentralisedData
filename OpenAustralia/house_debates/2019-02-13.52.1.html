       <p>
        Today marks the 11th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations. I want to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        , my predecessor as the member for Griffith and, much more importantly, the then Prime Minister, for having made that apology. It seems uncontroversial now, but of course there'd been a long road to get to that apology. It was particularly important that there were members of the stolen generations here on the floor of the parliament as a way of the parliament paying its respect to those people who had suffered such pain and loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        In marking the anniversary, I also want to mention Link-Up in my electorate, an incredible organisation that brings people back together with their loved ones. Sometimes they're graveside reunions; sometimes they're with living relatives. They're always incredibly difficult and incredibly moving. Thank you to Link-Up. In fact last year, on the 10th anniversary, they held a very large and well-attended commemoration at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_End" rel="nofollow">
         Hill End
        </a>
        in my electorate. It was wonderful to see Kevin Rudd there and to hear him address the assembled group on the anniversary of the apology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like so many Australians, I was so proud to watch the apology when it was given, and to hear the then Prime Minister give the apology. But I have to say it was pretty regrettable that there was a frontbencher from the Liberals who did not attend. Of course, that frontbencher was the then and current member for Dickson, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">

        . It was a great shame, and I'm sure that he remains very upset by his shameful absence from the apology to this day.
