        It seems somewhat discordant to go from that speech to talk about local roads, but yet I am going to. Local roads are not necessarily the most exciting subject, people would say, but it is an important subject for people in my community. Every day they drive around, trying to get to work, getting the kids to school, getting to netball and footy. Well-maintained roads and community facilities are absolutely essential components of local infrastructure, and they impact people's lives daily.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really pleased that the Albanese government has allocated more than $740,000 through phase 4 of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program to Frankston City Council. The neighbouring shire,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        Shire, which covers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Eliza
        </a>
        in my electorate, is also set to receive significant funding across the peninsula. This is a really important delivery from the government for local priorities, reflecting our government's support for local communities to grow and prosper. Councils like Frankston and Mornington Peninsula Shire will be able to undertake vital local road and community infrastructure projects with ongoing federal funding and funding over $740,000 which I have just talked about. Jobs are created and everyone benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know the councils love to get feedback from locals about what should be done for community infrastructure and roads and footpaths, so I urge everyone in Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula: if you have ideas for how that money should be spent to deliver better local infrastructure, get in touch with the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula councils. Let them know. The more we're engaged with the councils, the more they will be able to deliver what our community wants. There is no point complaining afterwards that what they have delivered is not what we want. What is absolutely invaluable to the future of our community is the views of those of us who live there. Input from locals is the best way for councils and state and federal governments to be able to form policies that mean we have a shared vision for growth and prosperity. So I'm really looking forward to seeing how this money is spent for the benefit of the community and for the community's involvement in it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education is the key to everyone's future. No matter where you come from, what your background is, what language is spoken at home, how much money your parents have, a good education is the way to a better future, and everyone should have access to a great education provided in a great facility. It's why this government is so committed to investing in the infrastructure of schools as well as the curriculum and the teachers. More than 1,300 schools across the nation are about to receive shares of $32 million in grants dedicated to upgrading schools infrastructure and providing new equipment.
       </p>

        In my community of Dunkley, four schools have been successful in their applications—four incredibly worthy schools. Aldercourt Primary School in

        in Langwarrin, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Eliza Primary School
        </a>
        in Mount Eliza are all set to receive funding for crucial projects to enhance the learning environment for students and to enhance their enjoyment of the school facility at all times. The sort of initiatives are outdoor learning spaces, upgrades to outdoor spaces, modification to classrooms, doors and windows to allow better airflow—which we learnt was so important during COVID—and repair and maintenance of local school facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Aldercourt Primary School recently got another grant of $16,000 through the school's upgrade fund. I visited the school recently. While it might seem modest in the scheme of things, the plan that they have for their outdoor classroom is so exciting. You can see that the students are excited. They looked very flash in their blazers, I have to say. The teachers are excited. What a school looks like matters, and I'm really proud to be part of improving it.
