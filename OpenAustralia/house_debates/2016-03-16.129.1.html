       <p>
        Thank you. I would like to inform the House of some great work that was done in my electorate of Charlton during the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        . True to the nature of these annual events, I saw the pride Charlton residents have in our beautiful home on the western side of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        To start with, I wish to warmly thank some of my youngest constituents, the students in kindergarten to year 6 at Speers Point Public School. Students took time out from the classroom to learn about waste management on 4 March, a day when schools across the nation strive to tidy up. With the Principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Payne" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Payne
        </a>
        , and the organising teacher, Di Wood, extending an invitation for me to join the occasion, I am pleased to report that I picked up my fair share of litter. They breed 'em tough in Charlton. The kids were fascinated by the discovery of a discarded snakeskin. This was not quite what we were looking for but it was a surprise and it was added to their science program for the next week. It was wonderful to see the children's interest, which was a testament to Chris, Di and their peers, as they expanded on what they were learning through Speers Point Public School's environmental programs. These initiatives investigate the relationship between what Australians do, the impacts on our ecosystem and sustaining our natural resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just around the lake, to the south, Stephen Dewar of the Toronto Area Sustainable Neighbourhood Group has been a constant advocate of environmental awareness in both Charlton and Shortland. He truly has his footprint on both sides of Lake Macquarie. This year the neighbourhood group's commitment to sustainability has strengthened as Steve and his peers targeted fast-food litter in the region for Clean Up Australia Day. As Steve has imparted to the people of my area, in their fast-paced lives some Australians may carelessly discard fast-food rubbish from their cars. Signs around Toronto discouraging waste are part of the neighbourhood group's mounting campaign 'Tossers can be binners'. To stop litterbugs disposing of refuse on the run, Steve has partnered with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonalds" rel="nofollow">
         McDonalds
        </a>
        in Toronto to send a clear message about waste, and they did this on 6 March. I want to thank McDonalds and the other restaurants in the Toronto area who have joined this worthy initiative. Joining Steve and the members of the group, I took part in the start of this event to clean the streets surrounding the restaurant.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge and thank Speers Point Public School and the Toronto Area Sustainable Neighbourhood Group for their participation in Clean Up Australia Day. I am privileged to have been invited to be part of their efforts. Lake Macquarie in my electorate flows into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Ocean
        </a>
        , so it is with pride that I can say the residents of Charlton are contributing not only to the health of our local environment but also to the health of our oceans and the planet. The lake has never been healthier. When I was recently at Belmont wharf, in the Shortland electorate, I saw many schools of large fish swimming directly under the wharf. It is a tribute to local environmental groups, local communities and the council that this lake is now almost pristine and a great environmental jewel in our area.
