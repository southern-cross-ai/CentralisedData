       <p>
        Earlier this week, the member for Ryan put a motion in relation to postcodes. I want to associate myself with her and commend her for doing so. Certainly in my electorate of Blair there is an issue that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        needs to address, and that is the 4306 issue. The 4306 postcode goes from the western suburbs of Brisbane and right up through the Brisbane Valley, but it bypasses areas like Toogoolawah and Erskine. It then goes into Moore and Linville. Curiously enough, this has caused a lot of problems for people who live in the upper part of the Brisbane Valley. Strangely and tragically, insurance companies have made decisions in relation to insurance which mean that the people who live in these areas, who are not necessarily flooded, end up with higher premiums. It has also been an issue because mail goes astray.

       <p>
        I have written Australia Post about this issue. I have met with Australia Post about this issue. I have agitated on people's behalf. Petitions have been run by the Moore and District Action Group in relation to this. I have signed those petitions. I commend the work done by locals in this regard but Australia Post needs to have a look at this again. The member for Ryan is absolutely correct on this issue. Australia Post should have a look at themselves and reassess this issue. The evidence is overwhelming. They need to change their view in relation to postcodes in south-east Queensland.
