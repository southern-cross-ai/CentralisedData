        During Seniors Week it is appropriate to pay tribute to our seniors and the work they have done to make my electorate of Wentworth such an amazing place to live. At least 13 per cent of all our residents are over 65 and, amazingly enough, at least 3,000 of our seniors are over 85. Because of the high concentration of seniors, we are fortunate to have many organizations that take good care of them, and we do have a good variety of aged-care accommodation. It is always dangerous to name a few organizations, but I will just mention a few.
       </p>

        who are celebrating this global organisation's 170th anniversary this year. It was founded in the United States in 1843, making it the world's oldest community service group. B'nai B'rith has been serving Jewish communities in Australia since 1965 and, in Wentworth, it operates one of only two Jewish retirement villages in Sydney, the Princess Gardens Retirement Village in

        on Ageing has been operating since 1982 and delivers services to Jewish frail, aged and those with disabilities to enable them to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. They are the only kosher Meals on Wheels providers. Centre on Ageing serves 479 mostly elderly clients by home-delivering kosher meals, offering counselling and advocacy, providing home support and personal care, and running healthy ageing programs and activities.

       <p>
        The Holdsworth Community Centre takes seriously its motto of 'A Happy Life'. Holdsworth's aim is also to keep older people living in their own homes as long as possible and support them to continue to lead the lives they want for themselves. Holdsworth now focuses on enabling people to do as much as they can for themselves for as long as possible. They are working with an increasingly old and frail population, mostly in their 80s and 90s, many with mobility issues and memory loss, but united in their determination to get the most out of life. Holdsworth is transforming what was once Meals on Wheels to a community cafe model, with transport and entertainment thrown in. It is a great example of an integrated community based organisation. One inspiring project it has just completed was a partnership with the local girls school, Kambala, in which the students spent a number of months getting to know seven families with a person with dementia and creating for each family a 'memory book' full of personal photographs and stories to assist in the retention of the memory of family connections and love and friendship.

        With all those things going on in Wentworth in Seniors Week, it is not surprising that we can celebrate a wedding. Four months ago, Maurice and Betty Zamel were married. Maurice is a sprightly 93 and Betty, a very young 91. They live at the Montefiore home in Randwick. During Seniors Week I wish this very gorgeous couple a very long and happy marriage.
