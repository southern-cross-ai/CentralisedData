       <p>
        More than 400,000 Australians currently live with dementia, a condition for which there is no known cure. Over the last few weeks, I have been meeting with people in my electorate who are affected by the disease and seeing first-hand the wonderful work that Wentworth is doing to support them.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cottage" rel="nofollow">
         The Cottage
        </a>
        daycare centre is a social group for people diagnosed with dementia but who are still relatively independent and able to participate in activities. The Cottage offers outings, games, music and shared conversation, usually over morning tea or lunch. I was impressed by the courage of participants, making jokes about the challenges of their disease and engaging with each other to stay healthy. A special thank you to their dedicated staff, including Eric and Marta, who are wonderfully supported by the team of bus drivers and committed volunteers.
       </p>

        I would also like to acknowledge the many Wentworth locals who took part in a recent Bondi2Barossa Ride to Remember, a nine-day riding college organised by the dementia research community charity based in Sydney's east. I had the pleasure of attending the opening ceremony in Bondi and I'm delighted to say that over $175,000 was raised to fund research into a cure for dementia, and the charity has raised over $1 million since 2016. Congratulations to the co-founders of the charity, Nick, Pierre and James, and the committee members who supported now, who have used their passion for cycling and turned it into support close to their hearts.
