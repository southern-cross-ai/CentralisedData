        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, especially in his capacity for emergency management. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is supporting Victorians to recover from the last fortnight's severe floods and storm damage and how the government is working to make Australia more resilient to natural disasters like these?

         I thank the member for Monash for his question. I acknowledge his leadership, but also the leadership of you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity as the member for Casey. I also thank the member for Gippsland, the member for Ballarat and the member for

         for their leadership in supporting their communities through a trying timeâ€”a trying time that, tragically, saw the loss of two lives. We simply say to every Australian: there is no risk worth taking; if it is flooded, forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are continuing to work with the Victorian government, as the lead agency, and I can inform the House that 120 ADF staff have been invited, at the behest of the Victorian government, to help in the clean-up. I thank the men and women of the

         who continue to support Australians in their time of need. We continue to also work in making sure there is immediate support for those who have been impacted. We partnered with the Victorian government, but also federal partners, to provide a range of support across 39 local government areas in Victoria.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's important people understand that immediate support is there. There will be further support as the Victorian government makes further assessments around the damaged infrastructure. By partnering with the Victorian government, we have announced the disaster recovery allowance payment, which is up to $1,960 per family. Also, because of the loss of power across a number of local government areas, there is a payment, for up to three weeks, of $1,680 per family and $2,500 for small to medium businesses to support them as a result of those losses of power.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal government has also initiated disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, and up to 13 weeks of income support for those that have lost employment or income as a result of these floods. We are making sure there is immediate support there on the ground with the Australian Defence Force to rebuild the communities and lives of those that were impacted.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also looking to ensure that we look to the future. I'm proud to say that the federal government, in partnership with state governments around the country, have created the $260 million Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, putting in mitigation works around the country to reduce the risk. Also, as part of the Emergency Response Fund, this year $50 million has gone out into flood mitigations across the country, to protect communities right around Australia from floods. Applications for next year will open up in July.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, as part of the budget, the federal government announced the new Preparing Australia Package, which is $600 million going into mitigation work. There is $200 million for partnering with households to protect their homes and $400 million in supporting community infrastructure around these towns to support them and those around them. So the federal government is making a here-and-now investment but also one into the future to protect lives and livelihoods from natural disaster.
