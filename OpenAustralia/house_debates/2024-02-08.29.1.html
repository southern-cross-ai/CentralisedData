        I rise today to congratulate the six new additions that have been inducted into the Wambo Coal Singleton Hall of Fame. Val Smith has for more than half a century donated her time and skills towards local community organisations and charities. We recognise her for her amazing community service. There are too many to list today, but some groups that Val has been part of include: the Northern Agricultural Association Committee and the Singleton

        was inducted for their public service. For half a century, generations of soldiers have been connected to Singleton through the completion of their training in the School of Infantry. The Singleton Service Widows Group, who are devoted to enhancing the lives of families of veterans who have served, were also inducted. The final inductee was Singleton Neighbourhood Centre, which provides a variety of community welfare services to the people of Singleton. Congratulations to all of you. Thank you for all you do in our community, and keep up the great work. Without people who donate their time, as you people have done, we wouldn't have community organisations and we wouldn't have the places we have in the Hunter. We thank you so much.
