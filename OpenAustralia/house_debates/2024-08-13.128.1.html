        Like many Australians, I've been closely following an outstanding performance by athletes at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Paris Olympic Games
        </a>
        . Among them were four of my constituents, Olivia Gadecki, Kaylee McKeown, Cory Weyer and Emma McKeon. Their performances have been truly remarkable, and they should be extremely proud. I give a special shout-out to Emma McKeon, who not only won three medals this Olympics but became Australia's most decorated Olympian, with 14 career Olympic medals. That really is something for our community to very proud of. Later this month, Maddie McTernan will also represent Australia in swimming at the Paralympics. I was lucky enough to meet with Maddie at the Arundel Park Riding for Disabled recently, where she was making a contribution, giving back to other people with disabilities. I wish her the best of luck for her events at the

        I recently had the pleasure of joining Men's Shed Labrador for their annual general meeting. This group has played a crucial role in promoting the health and mental wellbeing of their members while greatly contributing to the community. This is mateship while making stuff. I give a special mention to Len Thomson for his 14 years as secretary and Merv Holliday for his seven years of service as president. Best wishes to Gordon Cowser and the new executive. I am confident you will continue the men's shed mission with great success in the years to come.

        I recently attended the Queensland Country Women's Association Coomera Branch's annual general meeting. This group exemplifies our Australian values and has significantly contributed to our community over many decades in the local area. It was inspiring to hear the way these ladies' skills and collective effort have served our community over the past 12 months, and I look forward to seeing what they can achieve in the year ahead.

        Last month I had the pleasure of joining the Pimpama Probus club to celebrate their fourth birthday at their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_July" rel="nofollow">

        event. Their rapid growth, with the club now boasting over 100 members, reflects not only the vibrant community spirit in Pimpama but also rapid growth in the north of our city. I give a special thank you to club president Anne and the committee for inviting me to share this special occasion.

        Another recent highlight was my trip to Labrador State School, where I attended the Academic Parade. I was able to recognise high achievers by presenting students with awardsâ€”and, boy, were there are some great achievements recognised that day! It was fantastic to spend time with Principal Stephen Josey and hear about the exciting new developments taking place on their campus, including the completion of their very own central park, which I know will play an important role in the school campus for years to come. Well done, Labrador State School team. These are outstanding efforts by the students and it is a wonderful school that they should all be very proud of.
