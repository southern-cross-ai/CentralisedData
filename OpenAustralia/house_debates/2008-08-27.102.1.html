        I rise tonight to acknowledge in this place the valuable contribution to my local community of the recipients of this year’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith City Council
        </a>
        ’s Wall of Achievement awards.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall" rel="nofollow">
         The Wall
        </a>
        of Achievement is an initiative of the Penrith City Council that each year recognises the tireless work of members of the community. Awards are given to individuals for their work in business, sport, the environment, civics and community services and as carers. Recipients of the award have their photograph hung on the wall of the Penrith city library for 12 months, where several hundred thousand people walk past each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2008 Wall of Achievement recipients are having their awards conferred on them tonight at the Penrith City Council chambers. I wish to take a moment here in our nation’s parliament to reflect on these very special individuals and to offer my congratulations to them and their families. The 28 award winners for 2008 are

        and Ian Garton in the business category, Rodney Hayward in the carers category, Leigh Hartog in the civic category and Susan Oxenham in the culture and environment category. For their contribution to community services, winners are

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these people are proud citizens of the city of Penrith, and they demonstrate that pride through their respective contributions to our local community. These local heroes are the very nucleus of our community. They are the glue that binds our community together and gives us that sense of community spirit that is such an integral part of the Penrith character. Amongst these local heroes are volunteers visiting the sick and the dying in hospital, delivering meals to the elderly, coaching our up-and-coming athletes and inspiring and supporting young people. They are involved in our emergency services, business innovation and giving others purpose and direction through employment. Collectively, they have shown us that no problem is too big to solve as long as you have the dedication, the perseverance and the commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I regret that time does not permit me to speak in detail about the contribution of each of these award recipients. However, I would like to make a special mention of Kerry Wyborn, who was a member of Australia’s bronze medal-winning softball team at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and who hit the equalising home run in the seventh inning and kept Australia on the edge of its seat. I congratulate her for her efforts at the Olympics, acknowledge the hard work and sacrifices she and her family have made and thank her not only for representing her country but for representing her home town of Penrith on the world stage with such distinction.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge the outgoing 2007 Wall of Achievement award recipients, who have been fine ambassadors for Penrith. I express my thanks in particular to Gary Stockbridge and his wife, Delma, Ruth Hutchins and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Mason" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Mason
        </a>
        for their regular attendance at civic functions throughout the past year and for their ongoing pride in their city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I pay tribute to a good friend of mine and a 2002 Wall of Achievement award reci-pient,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Marshall
        </a>
        , who passed away last week. Greg had spina bifida and was wheelchair-bound but was a committed community volunteer and a passionate advocate for people with a disability. Greg Marshall was a true local hero and a source of tremendous inspiration. For around 15 years, Greg volunteered with the Penrith Disabilities Resource Centre, advocating for the needs of people with a disability and their carers. He lent his support to hundreds of people and their families and championed issues like accessible community transport. Greg graduated from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        with a certificate III qualification in vocational education and training administration and was presented with a certificate of appreciation from the Penrith City Council and from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Premier
        </a>
        for his work as a volunteer. Greg showed us all what can be achieved with determination, hard work and a passion for living. My best wishes go to his father, Bobby, and the entire Marshall family. I pay tribute to Greg’s important contribution to our local community and I know he will be sadly missed.
