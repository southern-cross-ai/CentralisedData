         The Leader of the Opposition asks a question about when did the Prime Minister's office know about this, and, indeed, that is the question. When did the Prime Minister's office know? There was, of course, an inquiry into what the Prime Minister's office knew and when and who was told, and we still have never seen the Gaetjens inquiry. We know, indeed, that the Leader of the Opposition asked this question, but I'm surprised, because he knows that he informed the Prime Minister's office days before there was any public announcement of this.

           It's on relevance. This is a tricky answer. The Prime Minister was asked a question. I asked with respect to your office—I framed it in that way. If he wants to play these silly, juvenile games, the Australian public—

                I want to deal with this matter before I return to the Prime Minister. As members know, including the manager and the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister cannot be asked, under standing orders—and the manager is correct: page 553 to page 555 of
                <i>
                 Practice
                </i>
                makes clear that ministers or prime ministers cannot be asked questions about their actions in a former role or as a private member before becoming a minister. The question was lineball in terms of what the Prime Minister is responsible for. Moving forward, questions will be ruled out of order in terms of actions or issues before ministers or prime ministers came into these roles. The Prime Minister is answering the question. I'm going to listen carefully to his answer to make sure he's being relevant to the standing orders but also being relevant to the question. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order?

                 I thank you for your instruction to the House. I seek clarity in relation to the points that you've just made. I understand the standing orders in

                  The question, as I explained, was in order; lineball. I'm going to listen carefully. He's one minute into his answer about the important, serious issues that were raised. I'll listen to him carefully. If he strays or if he is not in line with the standing orders, he will be brought back into order. I give him the call.

                   I was asked about what the Prime Minister's office knew. The truth is that that goes to the heart of what this issue is. The heart of this issue goes to an alleged sexual assault by a Liberal staffer against another Liberal staff member in a Liberal minister's office in 2019, metres away from the then Liberal Prime Minister's office. When these allegations became public, two years after the Morrison government became aware of the security breach, the truth is that it sent shockwaves not just through the parliament but through the nation, as it was the first step in exposing a problematic culture in what should be Australia's safest building, the one right here.

                   had an inquiry led by Phil Gaetjens, his former chief of staff, who was then the head of his department, the

                   </a>
                   , into who knew what and when in his own office. That report has never been released. What we do know is that the Leader of the Opposition informed the Prime Minister's office prior to that information becoming public. But he didn't reveal that until 10 days after news.com.au published this information at 8 am on 15 February, and

                   aired an interview with Ms Brittany Higgins that evening. For 10 days the Leader of the Opposition said nothing about what he knew and about the fact that he informed the Prime Minister's office on that day.
