         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives" rel="nofollow">

         ) has spent $484,628.14 on legal costs arising from appeals against access decisions in the period May 2018 to 10 January 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2. From 1 June 2016 to 10 January 2020 the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAA" rel="nofollow">
          NAA
         </a>
         has spent $682,692.05 on this matter.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3. As the matters mentioned in the answer to Question 2 are still before the Court, the NAA is unable to estimate remaining legal costs in relation to AA1984/609.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4. All expenditure for these matters relate to professional services from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government Solicitor

          AGS

         ). Expenditure covers services such as drafting and reviewing correspondence, research and court attendance.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         5. From October 2019, the NAA and the Attorney-General's Department (AGD) agreed to split the legal costs 75/25 relating to the matters raised in question 2. To date, the AGD has incurred costs amounting to $23,105.41 for AGS services. The NAA is unaware of any other legal costs that may have been incurred by any other Commonwealth entity in relation to the Hocking matter.
