        Last week marked the celebration of National Volunteer Week, which is a special opportunity to highlight the invaluable contributions of volunteers within our community. Volunteering is the backbone of our community, and I extend my deepest gratitude to every person who generously dedicates their time and expertise, enriching the local community in Fadden.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another big part of National Volunteer Week is encouraging new able individuals to get involved. Recently I received a message from a local chef who was inspired by one of my Facebook posts to volunteer with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Paradise Point
        </a>
        Meals on Wheels in the hopes of supporting her community. This is an outstanding example of how one person's contribution can add so much value to organisations through sharing their skills and expertise. Meals on Wheels at Paradise Point is one of the many valuable community-run initiatives providing an important service to those who are most vulnerable. With over 7,000 dedicated volunteers, Meals on Wheels delivers a staggering 2.6 million meals across Queensland alone, reaching out to more than 19,000 individuals with diverse support needs. But Meals on Wheels, of course, offers more than just a meal. It's about the human connection, providing a vital lifeline of social interaction and companionship.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so grateful for the opportunities I've had to work with the exceptional Paradise Point team throughout the years, and I implore those who are capable to explore the realm of volunteering. As part of this year's federal volunteer grants, Paradise Point Meals on Wheels recently received $5,000 in funding towards continuing their valuable work. Other successful applicants throughout Fadden included the Animal Welfare League of Queensland who are located at Coombabah, the Labrador Girl Guides and Pacific Pines Panthers Basketball Inc. I thank all of those and the other successful applicants for everything they do for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the spirit of acknowledging volunteers, I want to highlight the exemplary efforts of our

        s, community groups and schools in organising Anzac Day services across our electorate last month. This is the first time I've had an opportunity to speak about this wonderful day on our calendar. It was an honour to participate in the Anzac Day services at Helensvale,

         Upper Coomera
        </a>
        service which is being held at its location in Upper Coomera for the last time before the monument is moved to allow roadworks. Special thanks go to the Runaway Bay RSL, the Northern Gold Coast RSL and the many community groups and schools who delivered this year's services. It's heartening to witness the enduring legacy of reverence for those who bravely served our nation on the battlefield being not just preserved but passionately passed down to forthcoming generations. The tradition of Anzac Day ensures that the sacrifices made by our Anzacs are not forgotten but are cherished and honoured for years to come.

         At the heart of strong communities are volunteers. They are the backbone of our communities. This year's National Volunteer Week theme was 'Something for everyone', highlighting the rich diversity of volunteer opportunity, which is as prevalent as ever in my electorate of Fraser and right across our great country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week I was delighted to host a morning tea for the Fraser volunteer award winners. In keeping with this year's theme, our volunteers demonstrate the diversity in volunteer talent. Michael Sposato, President of the Sunshine Heights Junior Soccer Club, won in the sports category for his almost 40 years of contribution to the soccer club. Michael is passionate about young kids in the community having a social and sporting outlet and being bonded by team camaraderie. Michael is the first person at the club every morning for training and game days, and is the last one to leave. In the community category,

         and Brenton Watson from the Sunshine

         </a>
         continuously show their support for veterans and their families, organising social events and many other supports. They work tirelessly on organising events and building up the club. They also provide connections more broadly in the community. Each year the crowds at the Anzac Day and

         My electorate has a strong Vietnamese community, so it was fitting that quiet achiever Vinh Nguyen would be awarded the seniors award for his 40-year involvement with the Victorian chapter of the Vietnamese Community of Australia, as well as holding leadership positions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">

         of Melbourne Vietnamese chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Vivi Dangcong received an award in the youth category. Her passion for the arts, stemming from the Australian Vietnamese Arts group, prompted her to lead youth group projects to demonstrate to other young people how to preserve the environment through crafts and also how to preserve many aspects of Vietnamese culture. She also completed a program for young people to appreciate, promote and reconnect with their culture and the community via visual arts and dance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last but not least was Poonam Singh, who is devoted to women's equality and founded Women of Brimbank. This organisation connects migrant women and their families through informal gatherings and larger cultural events and festivals. Poonam has been actively involved in coordinating and leading numerous programs aimed at empowering committees, particularly migrant women and survivors of domestic violence. Her volunteering work with this organisation has been ongoing for several years, demonstrating her long-term commitment to making a positive impact.
        </p>
        <p>
         These award winners demonstrate how volunteers underpin so many activities right across the community. This is true of Fraser and, as I mentioned before, right across Australia. Volunteer Week is an important time for us to recognise people who don't necessarily want recognition but whom it's right for us to recognise. They provide an incredible service to people in our committee who need it the most. Thank you to all of the award winners and all nominees.
