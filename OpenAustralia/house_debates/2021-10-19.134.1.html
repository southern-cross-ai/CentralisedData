        , was unfortunately killed in the line of duty while tracking a wanted person in Maryborough this year. It's a fitting tribute that the dog park in Neptune Street, Maryborough, near where Rambo found a missing child, has now been named in his honour. Last week his handler, Sergeant Ian Grigoris, the Police Dog Squad and

        opened the off-leash dog park in his memory. Rambo rescued a young girl, tracked down offenders and died pursuing an offender with his handler.

        We acknowledge National Police Remembrance Day every year on 29 September, where we pause to reflect on the courage of those who put their lives on the line to protect our communities. This year we honour three members who lost their lives since last Police Remembrance Day in 2020: Senior Constable David Masters, Senior Constable Kelly Foster and Detective Senior Constable Michael James Cursiter. The death of any police officer is tragic for their loved ones, their colleagues and the community. Every time a member of the police force puts on their uniform and wonders what the shift will bring, they reflect on the dangers inherent in policing. The risks and the dangers associated with policing sometimes mean that a member won't make it home at the end of their shift.

        The past 18 months have been morale sapping for police, who have been the face of enforcing social distancing, arbitrary lockdown measures, and border closures across the nation. Police swear an oath and/or make an affirmation to serve the people according to the law. They don't make these laws. They enforce them. Whilst I'm one of the few who have done both, I spent a lot of time—16 years—dealing with sometimes poorly formed laws put out by parliamentarians. We deal with many political ramifications in this place, but people who deal with the front end of our decisions are often the police officers on the ground, who don't have a choice. Police, accompanied by their dogs and horses, have copped the brunt of our lockdown responses in protests across the nation. We should remember the risks all police take in the course of their duty. Thank you for the service of all the police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice and to all past and present serving members of the Australian police forces serving in uncertain and very trying times.

         I understand it would suit the convenience of the Federation Chamber for constituency statements to continue for an additional 30 minutes. There being no objection, I call the member for Adelaide.
