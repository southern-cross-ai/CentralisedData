        I rise tonight to speak on the importance of buying Australian made. We just recently celebrated Australian Made Week, which is a reminder for Aussie shoppers to embrace the incredible quality of locally made products.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government recognises the job-creating power of Australian manufacturers. Our government has invested $1.5 billion in the Modern Manufacturing Strategy. This means our much-loved green-and-gold logo can have a stronger presence not only on home soil but also internationally. The Morrison government is backing local manufacturers to scale up and grow. I'm experiencing the benefits of this firsthand in my electorate of Bonner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonner is home to some amazing businesses proudly showcasing Australian made product. There are local businesses like Make Your Life Easier, in Carindale, specialising in premium home organisation products; August Skincare, in

        , manufacturing top-quality cosmetics and skin care; Oz Backdrops &amp; Props in Wynnum, a leader in printed and digital backdrops, printing and more. This is just a glimpse of the diverse range of Australian made products we are manufacturing in Bonner.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to talk about my recent visit to Couplemate in Wynnum. This is a local business that is championing Australian made. Couplemate is based on the bayside, specialising in design, manufacturing and distribution of caravan and trailer parts. The last time I visited Steve and his team was late last year. Since then they have done fantastic work, reinvesting in Australian products and production. The business's dedication to what they do is second to none, resulting in their recent expansion and hiring of four new graduates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year was incredibly tough on small businesses, but the Morrison government delivered a plan that created jobs, supported our skilled workers and enabled growth. We now have more Aussies in work than ever before. Since my last visit to Couplemate, their apprenticeship machinist has completed his trade and is working full time as a qualified machinist. Upskilling jobs and our young people has never been more important. It is essential that we are equipping Australians with the skills that they need to get a job today and tomorrow. As part of this year's budget, the Morrison government doubled our commitment to the JobTrainer Fund. We already have around 1,400 apprentices in my electorate of Bonner, and these new measures will lead to more opportunities for apprentices and trainees. To see Aussie grown businesses just like Couplemate go from strength to strength during this time is remarkable. The Morrison government recognise that local businesses are the engine room of our economy and, to secure our recovery, we are making sure that they can get on with what they do best.
