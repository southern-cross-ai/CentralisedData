       <p>
        According to the latest Rental Affordability Index, which came out last week, Hobart is now the least affordable city in Australia for renters. That's dreadful news because of the thousands of people who are in precarious housing situations, sleeping rough, couch surfing and in unstable short-term accommodation. But it's also dreadful news because, sadly, a lot of this is preventable, because the housing crisis in greater Hobart is, in large part, due to a series of policy failures by state and federal governments. For instance, the state government has failed to properly invest in affordable housing such as crisis accommodation, Housing Tasmania properties and supported accommodation for people with specific needs. And they haven't reined in short-term accommodation like Airbnb, instead just playing catch-up after a few bad headlines. But it's too little too late.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current and former federal governments have failed as well. For example, there has been no reform on negative gearing nor on the capital gains tax discount, both of which skew the market in favour of wealthy investors. Moreover, there's been no increase to Commonwealth rent assistance. The federal government really must also waive Tasmania's public housing debt, which is costing us $15 million a year in interest payments alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone has a right to safe, secure and affordable housing. The state and federal governments both need to step up and do much better.
