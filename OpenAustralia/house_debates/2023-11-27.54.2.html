        I'm thrilled that our strong community campaign has saved the $20 million in funding secured by the former Liberal government for the

        and Killara Road upgrade in Coldstream. After a long 200 days since the Albanese Labor government put the project on the chopping block, it's pleasing that the federal Liberal funding to fix this intersection will remain in the

        . Thank you to the 1,000-plus people who signed my petition, the hundreds who attended community meetings and every member of our community who advocated to the federal government on this important project. The former Liberal government secured the funds to upgrade this dangerous intersection in 2019. After nearly five years of inaction by the Victorian state Labor government and this drawn-out review, it's time they got on with the job and fixed the intersection.

        ' dirt roads. My community knows that the Prime Minister has the wrong priorities. He's cut funding that would seal over 450 dirt roads in the Yarra Rangesâ€”a project that was being delivered on time and on budget and a project that he supported and committed funding to when in opposition. Now is the time to end the days of dust, potholes and mud, and I'll keep calling on the Albanese Labor government to seal these roads and work with our community to make sure that they are safe. (
