         Yet another question from the shadow Treasurer, who simply does not understand what is happening in the economy. The problem we have in the economy is an absence of demand, and the federal government is moving in to actually stimulate demand. So the problems in credit flow do not have anything to do at all with the government’s current borrowing program.

            It is a bit rich for this to come from those opposite, who opposed the bank guarantee, particularly the wholesale funding guarantee, which has probably done more than any other measure to put confidence into our system and which has stabilised the Australian economy. We have been very active to ensure that credit flows as freely as it possibly can, given what is going on internationally. The Australian government has been very active. For the shadow Treasurer to get up and somehow argue that borrowing is being crowded out by the federal government’s actions in borrowing to support demand is a nonsense.

              I thank the honourable member for his question. Again I would commend to those opposite some good news for the Australian economy in the midst of a global economic recession, and it goes to statements today by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
               CEO
              </a>
              of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Holden Australia
              </a>
              concerning the future of the company in this country. This is important for Australia. It is important for manufacturing in Australia. Today I met with the Holden CEO,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Reuss" rel="nofollow">
               Mark Reuss
              </a>
              , and he had already had earlier discussions with the industry minister, Senator Carr. The CEO of Holden has advised that Holden’s operations will be unchanged by announcements in the United States by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" rel="nofollow">
               General Motors
              </a>
              . Specifically, he has advised that Holden will be part of the new
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM" rel="nofollow">
               GM
              </a>
              . He has advised that Holden will not be included in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
               US
              </a>
              filing under chapter 11. He advised that there will be no direct impact on local design, engineering and manufacturing operations. He advised that technology improvements to the Commodore and the introduction of the second car line remain on track. He advised there will be no changes to Holden employees and supplier payment arrangements and he advised there will be no changes to Holden dealer and warranty arrangements. I would say this is good news for the Australian economy—good news at a time when we have seen such an assault on the automobile industry worldwide as a direct product of the global economic recession.
             </p>
             <p>
              We cannot underestimate the significance of developments in the United States in the auto industry. General Motors’ decision to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy is a powerful symbol of the challenges now facing the global economy. This is the single largest industrial bankruptcy in US history. The actions of the Obama administration to support the industry are unprecedented. But Holden here in Australia has not been caught up in these US developments. Holden is considered an A-list asset in the General Motors group. It is in contrast to speculation in Australia that this would directly wipe away Australian motor vehicle manufacturing, particularly through
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Holden" rel="nofollow">
               General Motors Holden
              </a>
              . Holden has forged its path through difficult circumstances, and the company’s leadership and its employees have worked together to achieve this. They have also done so in direct partnership with the Australian government.

              The Australian government last year, in the midst of great criticism on the part of those opposite, launched a $6.2 billion new Green Car Plan providing certainty for the sector right out for 2020. This was government acting ahead of the curve. This was government acting at a time—

                Can I
               </a>
               say to all South Australia members that I would suggest they consider long and hard whether they support this vital piece of industry policy and industry plan because it goes directly to jobs in South Australia and jobs for the auto sector more broadly across the country.
              </p>
              <p>
               As well, in December last year, I was pleased to visit Holden’s Elizabeth plant in Adelaide to announce a $149 million investment from the Commonwealth government’s innovation fund for the green car. This will be used for the production of a new four-cylinder small car here in Australia. Holden produces 100,000 cars a year, exports cars to all continents and employs over 6,000 Australians. Those 6,000 jobs are important jobs. They are like the jobs in the retail sector that the government is supporting by other policy means. They are like the jobs in the housing and construction sector that the government is supporting by other policy means. It is something of which this government is proud. We have been out there in partnership with industry. Australia is one of only 15 countries in the world that can produce a car from scratch. That is why we have been in there, with our sleeves rolled up, working with industry when it counted to provide confidence for the industry at a time of unprecedented downturn. All those opposite can do is scoff, be negative, talk the economy down, talk the industry down, talk manufacturing down. I would suggest those opposite should change their tone.
              </p>

              <p class="italic">
               As an American and in Australia and watching this from afar I have worked in quite a few different places around the world and I, speaking on behalf of GM, have to say that we are absolutely fortunate to have a government that actually cares about manufacturing.
