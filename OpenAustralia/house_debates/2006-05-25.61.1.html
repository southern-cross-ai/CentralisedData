          on 26 February that the share sale was not the result of inside knowledge of the contents of the Volcker Report, and that he had always intended to sell his shares when the price hit five dollars;

          the $5 trigger price for AWB was in fact reached 18 months earlier, on 10 March 2004, and the share price hit that point on another 30 occasions between 10 March 2004 and 5 October 2005;

            Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: notwithstanding the discomfort of the Leader of the House, standing order 80 is clear and nothing can be done to prevent the member having the right to move his motion. It would be a travesty if the executive did have the capacity to interfere with the right of any member to move any motion in this House.

             Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the member for Wills is following the directive of the Speaker, who on 23 May said that the member for Wills should move a substantive motion. This is indeed a substantive motion, and the member for Wills should be allowed to read it and debate it.

              I thank you. I will rule on the point of order. To the member for Fraser: standing order 80 says that if the member is speaking, as the member for Wills was, the question could be put that the member no longer be heard, but I do not believe that the chair has the ability to cut off the member for Wills’s motion. The member for Wills may proceed.

                Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask the obvious, which is that the Leader of the House withdraw that remark. He has a particular responsibility to uphold standards in this House. He once again has gone that yard too far.

                That is just—

               <p>
                The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. Under standing orders I am required to put the motion of the Leader of the House immediately. I will put that motion immediately.

                Mr Deputy Speaker—

               <p>
                The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I intend to put the motion immediately. All those of that opinion say aye; to the contrary no. Is a division required? Ring the bells for four minutes.

                Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Cowan made a very abusive remark about the chair and I ask that he withdraw that remark.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thank the member for Paterson. I did not hear the remark—
               </p>
               <p>
                You are ruling on his point of order, but—
               </p>
               <p>
                and, to cool the House down, we might just leave it at that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Would you confirm that the motion before the House is ‘That that snivelling grub be no longer heard’. If that is the motion before the House, would you rule it out of order, because it clearly is unparliamentary.
               </p>
               <p>
                Order!

                 The Manager
                </a>
                of Opposition Business has asked me to restate the motion.
               </p>
               <p>
                No!
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry—has asked me to clarify what the motion was. For the benefit of the House—and I have already advised the Manager of Opposition Business of this—the Leader of the House did withdraw the words that are complained of; therefore the motion—
               </p>
               <p>
                <i>
                 Mr Swan interjecting
                </i>
               </p>
               <p>
                The member for Lilley walks a fine line by calling the Deputy Speaker an idiot.
               </p>
               <p>
                <i>
                 Mr Crean interjecting
                </i>
               </p>
               <p>
                The member for Hotham walks a fine line by clapping. For the benefit of members, the question before the House is ‘That the member be no longer heard’.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise another point of order. At what point was that motion moved? Not one person on this side of the House heard it. Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, in respect of the withdrawal of what you say were the offensive words, my clear recollection is that the Leader of the House said, ‘If I have offended grubs, then I withdraw.’ That is not an unconditional withdrawal; it is not an effective withdrawal; he never withdrew unconditionally the offensive words. The motion before the House is clearly out of order, because no in order motion was moved.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. The Leader of the House has clarified that it is his intention to withdraw those words and that what he said was intended to withdraw those words. I accept that. We will continue with the division.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: no subsequent withdrawal can change the terms of the motion that was moved. He has to withdraw the motion and move another one. You cannot put before the parliament a motion containing unparliamentary language. It is a disgrace.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thank the member for Fraser. I intend to put the motion. The motion is ‘That the member be no longer heard’. The ‘ayes’ will pass to the right of the chair, the ‘noes’ will pass to the left of the chair—
