       <p>
        This morning I met with some amazing women who are aged-care workers, nurses and unionists, who came to talk to me about their enthusiasm and hope for the future of the care economy and their workplaces because of the Albanese Labor government—about the difference that the increase to the minimum wage has already made to their lives, about the changes the reforms that the Minister for Aged Care is bringing into aged care are going to make to the way they can deliver care, and about the changes that need to be made so that

        teachers aren't being casuals for eight years and missing out on all of the things they need from permanent work.
       </p>
       <p>
        These women, these workers, are why everyone in this government is here—to make sure that their lives and their workplaces are better and to make sure that the work they do, caring for some of the most vulnerable people in this country, can be done to the best of their ability. They now have a government for the first time in a decade that has their back. We feel that responsibility and we are proud to take it on, because it's the reason we on this side of the chamber are here. We're here to make sure that workers get the pay and the conditions they deserve and that people who are cared for by those workers, who are predominantly women, get the care they deserve.
