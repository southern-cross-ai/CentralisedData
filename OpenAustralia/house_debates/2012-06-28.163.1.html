        Last Saturday I had the honour of attending the Festival of the Chariots celebration in Bigge Park, Liverpool, in my electorate. I was joined at the event by the member for Werriwa; the member for Hughes; the state member for Liverpool,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lynch" rel="nofollow">

        , and the

        mayor, Wendy Waller.

         The Festival

        of the Chariots was being held in over 100 cities around the world. It certainly presents an opportunity to celebrate the contributions made by the Indian and Fijian-Indian communities worldwide. In fact, the Ratha-Yatra festival or, as it is known, Festival of the Chariots is one of the oldest continuously celebrated spiritual festivals in the world. The event has a wonderful history, tradition and significance of the ancient nation of India.

        As far back as most records show, the splendidly decorated chariots of the

        have rolled each summer in the town of Puri on the Bay of Bengal, in India, to the delight of millions of joyous pilgrims. The towering red and blue silken canopies rise into the skies as the drums and cymbals surround the joyous celebration. The celebrations in the city of Liverpool in my electorate were slightly more low key but festive nevertheless. During the local celebrations, visitors took part in the street parade and cultural show and sampled very tasty vegetarian snacks. I would like to praise the hard work of Arvind Baldeo and his organising committee for coordinating this wonderful festival.

        The Indian and

        communities certainly make a valuable contribution to my electorate of Fowler and the wider Australian community. According to the recent census data, more than 3,000 individuals from Indian and Fiji Indian backgrounds reside in my multicultural electorate of Fowler, and they have a great influence. Bear in mind that 800 of these local residents were born in India while 2,500 Fowler residents noted they follow the Hindu religion. The Indian community is one of a large number of diverse cultural and religious communities residing in Fowler. This is a testament to the success of multiculturalism and diversity in our great nation. Multiculturalism in Australia is about building a shared sense of nationhood forged through mutual respect, common values and a commitment to fairness and equity. This did not happen by chance in south-west Sydney but through the hard work and dedication of members and leaders of a number of different cultural and religious groups. I have always been touched by the talents and the cultural richness of our fellow Australians who come here as migrants and refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Festival of Chariots was organised as part of the Refugee Week celebrations conducted throughout our nation last week. Refugee Week provides us with an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the unique position that refugees and recently arrived immigrants hold in our community. The Festival of Chariots truly showcased the wonderful cultural and social contribution made by those Australians of Indian and Fijian origin to our community. Indian Australians have played, and continue to play, a very important role in shaping the face of Australia today and building a bridge of friendship between India and Australia. Tens of thousands of Indian international students are welcomed to study in Australia each year and they will undoubtedly help to further the good relationship between our two countries in the years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud and honoured to have the opportunity to represent such a diverse community. I see first-hand the values of multiculturalism as it is played out on a daily basis in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        . People who come to this country for various reasons, out of fear, fleeing persecution or oppression or alternatively applying to come here as immigrants, all do so with a view of pursuing a better way of life. I note from south-west Sydney the contribution our diverse range of ethnic communities makes in terms of reshaping the face of our nation. They certainly change our outlook and I for one believe we are the richer for it.
