       <p>
        I welcome the opportunity today to provide an update on the Bombala community's Currawarna assisted living proposal. Last year we saw the Currawarna aged-care centre close its doors after 43 years of operation. The centre was built by the community. It was a much loved facility in that community and was proudly supported by the Bombala and Monaro communities. It was a victim of staff shortages and the changing structure of aged care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was upset and frustrated last year, as were so many people in that community, when the Morrison government stood by and did nothing when the facility closed. But the strength of this regional community has meant that they started the #standwithcurrawarna Facebook page. They formed a committee, and they've now got a proposal, the Currawarna assisted living proposal, which utilises the existing facility to provide affordable, supported housing for those who are unable to continue to live at home independently. The facility would have access to the care-at-home packages from the My Aged Care program, as well as to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        packages, to provide services on the premises, while the cost of residential living will be paid for by the residents without the need for residential aged-care deposits. The committee envisage that this will also support in the delivery of home-care and NDIS packages to the wider community by centralising the demand in a central location.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was extremely pleased that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Whan" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Whan
        </a>
        , the Labor candidate for Monaro in the upcoming state election committed a Minns Labor government to fully fund this community driven project, a commitment that will build on the incredible efforts of the community, who have already fundraised over $200,000 to get this up and running. The community know that it will take about $1 million of working capital to get this facility open, and they have got there with the commitment from Steve Whan.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project needs to go ahead. It doesn't need more political gameplaying. We know that this fits directly into the state government's responsibilities in assisted living. Without the need for continued federal funding, this commitment gets this centre open. I look forward to Saturday coming along and those residents of Bombala and the Monaro district being able to vote for a proposal to get this back open for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today also to discuss the Australian government's landmark national cultural policy Revive: A place for every story, a story for every place, which was released in January this year. It's a five-year plan to renew and revive Australia's arts, entertainment and culture sector. It delivers the momentum that Australia's creative workers, organisations and audiences need to continue to thrive and grow so that our arts culture and heritage are repositioned as central to Australia's future. The mighty Eden-Monaro is full of stories of renewal and revival, and I'd like to highlight just a few of those today.

        Three years on from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
         Black Summer
        </a>
        bushfire, artists Nat Ord and Vanessa Keenan have collaborated to produce
        <i>
         Mid Stories
        </i>
        , a multi-artform exhibition that explores the impact of the fires on our landscape and our community. It uses photography, video, solargraphy, augmented reality and installation to show the destruction and the regeneration of the Batlow area. Having lived through the Black Summer fires, Vanessa and Nat used their experience to inspire their art.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Regeneration Roadtrip, which was developed by Navigate Arts was an arts road trip from Canberra to the far
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        . It showcased the incredible arts across many towns and communities of Eden Monaro. Hosted in September and October last year, the self-guided road trip included stopovers at concerts, exhibitions, installations and workshops. Yuin artist Warren Foster Sr recreated and installed a scar tree for the Regeneration Roadtrip project. He held talks to explain the significance of scar trees in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        cultures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locals recognise the immense value of the sector to our economy, to our community and to our culture. Revive will empower talented artists and arts organisations like Nat, Vanessa and Warren and organisations like Navigate Arts to thrive and to grow, unlocking new opportunities, reaching new audiences and telling stories in a compelling way. On that note I give a quick shout-out to local Braidwood artist John R Walker, who has just had his artwork

       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'll give a quick shout-out to the Sapphire Coast Skate Park Association. This organisation has been working for years, trying to get a renewed skate park in the township of Merimbula. We're now a step closer. The council has confirmed that it will back
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Park" rel="nofollow">

        , in particular, who has been driving this project for a number of years. Our election commitment of $500,000 will see stage 1 of that project delivered in Merimbula.
