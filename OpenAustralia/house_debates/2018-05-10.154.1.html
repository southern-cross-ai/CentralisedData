Numbers will go through 7,000 this year, which is a wonderful statistic. We have an international coaching centre in Lismore, and we've also produced some local icons such as a Socceroo,

Iraqi veteran Jake Scobie was visiting his mother, Gail, when he and a Dutch backpacker heard the screams of Robert's mother, Vivien, after a wave had dragged Robert out deeper and she could no longer see her son. Without a moment's hesitation the two men ran into the surf, reached Robert and were able to pull him back to safety. I thank them both.
