        I wish to speak about the Dugandan Dive and the Cancer Council of Queensland. The Cancer Council of Queensland is the leading anticancer organisation in Queensland and provides a vital link between the public and people with cancer in Queensland. Currently, one in three Queenslanders will be diagnosed with this life-threatening disease. My family has been touched. I wish my father well: he is currently suffering from prostate cancer and bone cancer.
       </p>

        It has been my privilege to go to the Dugandan Dive for the last three years. On Saturday, 24 January 2009 it was held at the Dugandan pub and the Dugandan oval. The event is known as the Dugandan Hotel annual skydive. Winnie Parker and her husband Gary have organised the Dungandan Dive for the last three years to raise funds for the Cancer Council of Queensland. The Dugandan Dive originated in 2007, and its genesis can be traced to Winâ€™s decision to parachute-jump for her 50th birthday to try to overcome her long-held fear of flights and of heights. Win discussed her wishes with the locals at the pub, which is located just south of the township of Boonah. Win could hardly believe how many people dreamed of skydiving themselves. At the time, one of her staff members had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, so the decision of Win and Gary to do this provided a great opportunity for the Cancer Council of Queensland to promote its organisation in the Boonah shire. Sadly, a second staff member was diagnosed shortly thereafter.

        approached a skydive company and learned that landings could be held on the oval just opposite the pub. A country carnival has been created. Rim

        100.1 operates there. There are vocalists and musicians, and artisans and local businesspeople ply their wares. They have asked for donations, and in 2007 they raised $16,717. In 2008, $35,000 was raised. So far this year over $20,000 has been raised by the tireless team of staff and volunteers, as well as Win and Gary.

        Win said to me recently that it is nearly impossible to talk to someone who has not been affected by cancer. Nicole Baker, the fundraising officer of the Cancer Council of Queensland has been effusive in her praise of Win and Gary and the volunteers. In honour of the efforts of Win and Gary, the Cancer Council of Queensland has created a research grant which helps fund breast cancer research and the employment of a professor at the Queensland Institute of

        . This is an important activity in my area. Congratulations to Win, Gary and the local community. They are a tribute to the whole Boonah shire.
