        In Lismore the Gahan family and baseball go hand in hand. In 2011, Michael Gahan played for Queensland, taking out the national youth championship. In 2015, he took up a position with the United States college team of Miles Community College in Montana. In 2018, he was selected in the Australian under-23s team that competed in the world cup. Michael's great-great-grandfather, Herb, was a scorer and his great-great-uncle Michael Sr played for

        . Second-generation cousins Michael Jr and Peter both represented Queensland, with Peter being selected in the 1981 Australian All-Stars World Cup team. Michael's grandfather Maurice represented Queensland and his three great-uncles all represented at a national level. Chris played in the Australian team, Terry played in the All Australian Country team and Paul played in the

        , while his uncle Andrew was the Far North Coast Rookie of the year. His dad, Anthony, has also represented Queensland. In 2013, Michael's mum, Emma, received the Far North Coast Commissioner's Award for her outstanding commitment to baseball, and Michael's younger brother Jordan was also selected in the Australian under-14s squad several years ago. This family obviously has a very proud tradition and history around baseball, and they do our community and our nation proud in the world of baseball. Congratulations to all of them.

        Glenreagh has a very rich history in timber dating back to the first settlement of the village. This festival is all about preserving the skills developed by the industry. I congratulate the Glenreagh community and I very much look forward to being there on Saturday.
