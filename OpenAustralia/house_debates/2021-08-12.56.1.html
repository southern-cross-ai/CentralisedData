        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 11 residents and three staff at an aged-care facility in Newcastle have been infected with COVID? The facility's chief executive says only one-third of staff have received even one dose of the vaccine. These workers were meant to be fully vaccinated by Easter. Who is the Prime Minister going to blame for this one?

         I want to thank the member. I can confirm that the Royal Freemasons Benevolent Institution Hawkins Masonic Village, in Edgeworth, has had a series of COVID-positive cases. Eleven COVID-positive residents have been transferred to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          John Hunter Hospital
         </a>
         . Of these, 10 are fully vaccinated. All residents have been offered vaccination. One is, sadly, not vaccinated. I would continue to urge, around the country, the family and friends of those who are in residential aged-care facilities to provide the consent and to take up the opportunity, because it can literally save the lives of your friends and family members.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the facility, 76 residents are fully vaccinated of a total of 84 residents. All, though, have been offered vaccination on a number of occasions. In terms of the staff, the figures I have are that there are 28 staff that have been fully vaccinated and a further 17 staff with one dose. In terms of the actions to support the situation at this stage, residents have been transferred to hospital, and

         stocks have been reviewed and are considered to be adequate. There is an order for 5,000, however, that has been placed with the National Medical Stockpile. In addition to that, an infection control lead has been put in place. A deputised nurse practitioner has assumed that role, and they're getting assistance from the Commonwealth government. In addition to that, workforce support has been activated through the Commonwealth's surge workforce, and a request was placed on 10 August for two additional

         s and four additional other nurses to assist with workforce on site. These are the actions that have been taken. These are the actions that, importantly, have seen 76 of 84 residents fully vaccinated. We would continue to urge and encourage all those family members who are speaking for residents to help get those last residents vaccinated. It's available and it can help save their lives and protect their lives.
