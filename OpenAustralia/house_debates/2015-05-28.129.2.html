       <p>
        In this constituency statement I want to highlight again the issue of inborn errors of metabolism, which I have been highlighting through the parliament this week. No decision highlights more highly the cruel and, frankly, pathetic nature of the government than the budget decision to cut what is a tiny subsidy of around $250 per month to help cover the costs of specialist foods for the families of 900 Australians suffering from rare conditions known as inborn errors of metabolism, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEN" rel="nofollow">
         IEN
        </a>
        . Managing these conditions requires a lifetime commitment to a rigid diet of carefully weighed synthetic, low-protein formulas and foods that are often very expensive to buy. They are not foods that are available in general supermarkets. They are not gluten-free foods. They are specific low-protein to no-protein foods. Pasta and rice at $10 a packet and cheese after shipping costs is included at $68 a block.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without warning or consultation to any of these families or the organisations that represent them, they were informed last week that the grant would cease next month. I now want to read to the House a letter I received from a constituent of mine called Heidi about the impact that decision has had on her. Heidi writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can only consume 10g of protein a day as set by my dietitian. As a result, I cannot eat most dairy, nuts, legumes, meat, fish and grains. My diet consists of fruits and vegetables that are low in phenylalanine and specially formulated low protein products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2001 I and many others with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEM" rel="nofollow">
         IEM
        </a>
        s have received an IEM a monthly payment of $256.75 to assist with the cost of special food which has now been cut in the latest budget The reason provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        for ceasing the grant is that more supplements are now available and that low protein foods are now more accessible and lower in cost. Both of these reasons are false.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a teacher's aide on a fairly low income, I feel very anxious at the release of this budget measure as I am certain that I will not be able to afford the low protein products I need to stick to my log protein a day.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        cannot stick to my diet my long term neurological health is at risk which could affect my capacity to work and live as a normal person.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know from letters and emails forwarded to me and my colleagues that Heidi is far from alone in her distress, and I strongly suspect that there is not a member present who has not received similar correspondence since the budget. I wonder how the Treasurer can reconcile this pathetic small-minded measure, which only punishes those reliant on the subsidy to help cover the cost of protecting people with this very rare disease, with the miniscule savings. This is $3 million; this is not a big program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, I want to call on the Abbott government to seriously reconsider the cutting of this program, stop blaming people for their own decisions and actually reverse what is a very pathetic and small-minded decision in this budget.
