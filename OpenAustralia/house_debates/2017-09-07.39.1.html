        Danielle Tindle was a courageous, inspirational and extraordinary young woman who passed away suddenly last Friday. For the last 13 years of her life, Danielle devoted herself to improving the survival rates and quality of life for young cancer sufferers. She herself came back from the brink of death, surviving Hodgkin's lymphoma in her early years, and, by extraordinary chance, it was her own father's groundbreaking stem-cell research which contributed to saving his daughter's life. But then, midway through completing her PhD, she was diagnosed with a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma. Despite her setback, she continued her strong advocacy for young cancer survivors right around the globe. She was a strong voice in the press, on

        , in keynote addresses, as the chair of committees and, indeed, around the world at conferences for the unique challenges of young cancer sufferers. She advised cancer charities in Australia, in the

        and in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        . Her connection with Rare Cancers Australia helped highlight the significant costs of access for those suffering rare cancers to lifesaving and new treatments. For her advocacy for adolescent and young adult cancer sufferers, Danielle was awarded her PhD in 2015 and she was then, in 2018, a finalist in the Queensland Australian of the Year awards.
