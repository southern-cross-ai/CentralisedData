        Each year, I have the distinct pleasure of running and judging a Christmas card design competition in my electorate of Brisbane. The entrants are local primary school students, and the winners’ artwork is emblazoned in full colour on the front of my Christmas card which I send to all residents right across Brisbane. It's always an occasion when emerging young artists can show off their talent, their flair and their creativity. This year’s entries did not disappoint with their artwork on the theme of 'Christmas At My Place'.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year's overall winner was Lucy Sadler from Wilston State School. The winner in the Prep/Year 1 category was Sandra Syam of Eagle Junction State School, and the runner-up was Thomas from Newmarket State School. The winner of the Year 2 category was Olivia Bongers of Ashgrove State School, and the runner-up was Sophie Farley, also of Wilston State School. The winner of the Year 3 category was Ava McMillan from Our Lady Help of Christians, and the runner up was Mannat Verma of Enoggera State School. Congratulations to those talented young people right across Brisbane. I thank all of them for making my Christmas card so bright and colourful in 2020. A big thank you also goes to the other 500-plus young participants and entrants from schools right across Brisbane.

        The spirit of Christmas remains strong in Brisbane despite—or maybe because of—what has been an incredibly difficult and challenging year for so many residents, groups and local businesses. I want to give a shout-out to two Christmas street events being held soon in support of our fantastic local small businesses—in the Paddington Terraces and in Wilston Village in Kedron Brook Road.

        Working closely with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        , I've been pleased to fight for and deliver federal funding to put in place capital works and street improvements for both of these key business districts. The project at Wilston Village has seen $150,000 of federal funding, matched by Brisbane City Council, to deliver balustrades with artist designed panels, creative gobo projections, urban stools and a drinking fountain, including a dog bowl facility. The project in Paddington has seen $250,000 invested to deliver an illuminated welcome gateway sign to the precinct, street tree lighting, gobo projection displays and some really amazing largescale art murals and displays that are helping to make Paddington an even more amazing and unique destination for Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate and thank everyone who has worked so hard to bring these local projects to life, including so many small business people and local organisers who give again and again for the benefit of our local community. And, in closing, I remind all business locals once more how important it is for all of us to remember to support and love our local shops.
