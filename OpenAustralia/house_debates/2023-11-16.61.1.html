        My electorate is an absolutely amazing electorate. Last weekend was an absolute cracker. The Sheffield Mural Fest was on. Congratulations to brothers Kerry and Malcolm Nicholson from Queensland, who took home the $15,000 major prize for the

        On Saturday, I attended a

        </a>
        service in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Town" rel="nofollow">

        , with guest speaker Geoff Parkes, from Nasho Fair Go, who delivered a fantastic oration on behalf of Vietnam veterans.
       </p>

        Saturday afternoon was a day I look forward to all year with the Westbury show, which was celebrating its 160th year. There were many highlights, including the release of a book. The show goes on at Westbury!
       </p>
       <p>
        The next day, Sunday, I was back down south for another great country show in Brighton, the best country show in southern Tasmania. I had the honour of officially opening that show, alongside my state colleague Jen Butler.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to all the committees and volunteers of these amazing festivals and shows, who do such amazing work in the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also a sad time this week. Three days ago we lost Lindsay Birch, who was 41 years with the Tasmanian Fire Service, many years as a volunteer, mostly at Runnymede station. My condolences to Lindsay's family and the extended Birch family, an extended family that does incredible work out in the south-east of my electorate. Of course, I also give a shout-out to all the volunteers and emergency service responders who responded to the Dolphin Sands fires. Thank you.
