        I rise tonight to compel the Gillard Labor government to turn its rhetoric into action. It is now 303 days since Prime Minister Gillard made a crucial promise to the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">
         Port Stephens
        </a>
        . She promised to replace the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast 2025, a noise map which severely affects property values, the ability to sell homes, the building rights and the quality of life for thousands of my constituents. During the election campaign Prime Minister Gillard promised that her government would take action by the end of 2010. It is now 152 days past that self-imposed deadline, and we are still waiting.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday morning I was being interviewed on ABC Radio Newcastle on this very matter. Jill Emberson asked me what the hold-up was on replacing the ANEF. I honestly could not give Jill an answer. Updated noise data is contained in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANEC" rel="nofollow">
         ANEC
        </a>
        , a concept map. The parliamentary secretary in charge of this matter has had half-a-dozen meetings with the community to help him understand the importance of this. I have written numerous letters to the government explaining the ANEF's importance to allow the council to update section 149 property certificates. And yetâ€”nothing. The only possible reason I could provide was partisan politics: Labor deliberately stalling action on aircraft noise to try to score some cheap political points.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can tell the government right now that my constituents will see straight through it, and Labor will pay at the next election. This is not some stupid game; it is people's livelihoods at stake. As the movie character Darryl Kerrigan so famously said in the movie
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle" rel="nofollow">
          The Castle
         </a>
        </i>
        , 'A man's home is his castle.' My constituents' castles are under threat under this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take for example Robyn and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_South" rel="nofollow">
         Richard South
        </a>
        of Medowie West. Robyn and Richard are hardworking people who saved throughout their working lives to support themselves. They are also tender, loving parents, who have dedicated themselves to their disabled adult son. In early 2010, Robyn and Richard extended their home, including the installation of solar panels and roof water collection. Due to their son's condition, it is unlikely that he will become more functional than at present, so the long-term plan was to sell the current family home and use the proceeds to purchase a duplex closer to public transport and medical services. I want to make it very, very clear that Robyn and Richard did their due diligence when they bought their home. They knew they would hear some noise from the airport, and that was fine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then suddenly, with the introduction of the ANEF 2025, their property rights were affected for the very first time, through no fault of their own. They now fear their property is next to worthless. Under the current noise map, if their home were to burn down it would cost tens of thousands of dollars extra to rebuild because of the insulation required. The ANEF footprint map has also deterred potential buyers. Robyn and Richard wrote to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now in our sixties, we are facing an uncertain future. Our right to self determine our future and cater for the needs of both ourselves and our son has been taken from us without consultation, communication or consideration. This is causing undue stress and impacting on our health and that of our son, who already has difficulty due to his illness and medication. Our ability to continue as self funded retirees will be harshly impacted as this property was part of our savings and superannuation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is powerful stuff. I ask here today that the Prime Minister put herself in the shoes of my constituents. Perhaps then she may realise what her procrastination is really costing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Gillard promised that there would be no carbon tax under her government. However, after winning the election, a carbon tax was her No. 1 priority. She also promised she was committed to the duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        by 2016. However, she did not provide the necessary money in the budget. Prime Minister Gillard promised she would lift the ANEF by the end of 2010. However, 152 days after that date, it remains still in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have lost faith in the Prime Minister's word, yet I have not lost faith in the power of the local community that works so hard. No group of people have worked harder for each other than those in Port Stephens who have tirelessly fought on this issue not only for themselves but for their neighbours, past and present, friends and strangers. They deserve action, not rhetoric. I say to the Prime Minister: do your job and take action on aircraft noise as you promised. That begins with a new ANEF, something you promised the people of Paterson in the days before the election.
