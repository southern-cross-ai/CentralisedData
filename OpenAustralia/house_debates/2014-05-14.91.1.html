        My question is to the Prime Minister. During this question time, on eight occasions the Prime Minister has lacked the courage to admit that he broke his promises. Enough is enough. Will this Prime Minister come to the dispatch box, look Australians in the eye and apologise for his lies?

               Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You very generously allowed the Leader of the Opposition to mount an argument that was masquerading as a question. He is now trying to do it a second time, and you have given him another chance. Either he has to ask a genuine question or you should sit him down and take the next question from this side of the House.

                The point I was making was I made the Leader of the Opposition withdraw the word that was totally unparliamentary, and he knew it. He has now withdrawn it, so there is no question before the chair. I said he may rephrase it; it does not mean to use the same argumentative material.

                    May I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is all politics, no policy; all complaint, no solutions. And I might offer this thought to members oppositeâ€”that confected moral outrage is no basis for governing a countryâ€”

                        What this country needs is a government which is prepared to confront the reality that our country faces, the reality of debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see, the debt and deficit disaster which the members opposite, the Labor Party, created. This government did not create the problem but we take responsibility for addressing it. We take responsibility for fixing the problemâ€”the debt and deficit disaster that Labor created. I think that is exactly what the people of Australia elected us to do and I am proud to serve them in my capacity as Prime Minister of this great nation.

                             does not miss out. In fact, there will be $4.7 billion of infrastructure investment in Western Australia over the next few years. It will be investment in productivity lifting and in enhancing infrastructure, which will mean more jobs and greater prosperity for our country. This investment is $16.5 billion more than the Labor Party promised during their election campaign on infrastructureâ€”$16.5 billion more for funding projects such as the

                             This project will be a huge benefit for the member from Durack because all the goods from her part of the world, which are our great export lifeline, will be able to be moved more quickly through Perth, getting trucks off the major highways. This will also mean commuters can drive on the roads without competing with big trucks. This is a huge reform, thanks to the innovation of the infrastructure Prime Minister and his government, and the Western Australian government. This is not only a $50 billion program; it is a program with innovation at its heart.

                             The Labor Party did not support and was utterly opposed to the WestConnexâ€”Stage 2 project. It was also utterly opposed to and did not have any idea about the East West Link project in Melbourne and the North-South Corridor in Adelaideâ€”we are delivering both projects. The Labor Party did not have it within its wit to do so. This is the infrastructure Prime Minister driving productivity growth in our country, driven through a Treasurer who has put in place in the budget the money required to ensure that these projects get doneâ€”not just announced on whiteboards but actually done and delivered. New projects worth $50 billion is a fantastic development for Australiaâ€”that is, more jobs, more growth and a stronger Australia.

I am absolutely confident that, when the Australian people come to judge this government and this opposition in 2016, they will vote for a government which has been faithful to its pre-election commitments. Do you know what the Australian people were looking for in the election last year? After six years of dysfunction, the people of Australia were looking for some leadership. They were looking for a government that was prepared to make not the easy decisions but the hard decisions. The people of Australia were looking for leadership. Last night they found it.

                                  I am very pleased to be able to tell the member for Swan that we are delivering better outcomes for school students across Australia through this budget. We are doing it by funding our election commitments to the letter, whether they are through teacher quality, a robust curriculum, principal and school autonomy or parental engagement. We are funding all of those commitments to the letter.

                                  Even better, we are keeping the commitment we made before the election that we would fund the new school funding model in exactly the same way as Labor for the next four years and that is what we are doing. We have also put $1.2 billion back into school funding which the Leader of the Opposition took out when he was the ninth Minister for Education in the previous government.

                                  The Leader of the Opposition would like the people to forget that. They would like the Australian people to have the memory of a goldfish, as the Leader of the Opposition has. But we will not forget and we will keep reminding the Australian public that the Leader of the Opposition removed school funding and we have put it back. Ironically, we are spending more in 2017 on school funding than Labor would have if they had been re-elected.

                                     I will. I withdraw. On Thursday night, the Leader of the Opposition has to do three things. He has to explain how he would address the debt and deficit disaster left by the previous government. He has to explain how he would address that. Secondly, he has to explain how he would fund the physical and skills infrastructure that Australia needs in the future without just borrowing more money from overseas, as the previous government did. He has to explain how he would deliver the infrastructure that we are delivering while reducing the tax burden by $5.7 billion over the budget. Thirdly, he has to explain how he would establish a sustainable safety net for Australians into the future, because that is what we did in the budget last night. In this budget, Australians have found that they have a government of adults who will make the tough decisions to make the safety net, which we on this side of the House all regard very highly, sustainable into the futureâ€”and not just by borrowing more money overseas. If he does not meet those three tests, explaining how he would deal with the budget, then he will not measure up as Leader of the Opposition on Thursday night.
