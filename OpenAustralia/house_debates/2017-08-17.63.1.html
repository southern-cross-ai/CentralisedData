       <p>
        Just before we came back to Canberra, I had the privilege of welcoming the Minister for the Environment and Energy to my electorate of Swan to join me in announcing that the Turnbull government provided $1.1 million to deliver stage 2 of the Swan-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning_River" rel="nofollow">
         Canning River
        </a>
        Recovery Program as part of our election commitments. The wild weather didn't stop us. We met at the Canning River Eco Education Centre, along with representatives from environmental and community groups, including the Canning River Regional Park Volunteers, the Wilson Wetlands Action Group and the Swan River Guardians, all of whom played a large role in the success of stage 1 of the program. It was a great opportunity for the minister to meet with some of our hardworking volunteers. I would like to thank those who attended.

        Funding for stage 2 of the Swan-Canning River recovery project will help to build on the important work undertaken during stage 1, which the Turnbull government also proudly supported with $1 million of funding. Stage 2 will continue to rehabilitate the iconic river system by addressing the damaging impacts of weeds on our wetlands, including eradicating the hydrocotyle weed from priority sites. I would like to make a special mention of the Perth NRM's Abi Smalley and

        Lisa Potter for their continued commitment to the project. I look forward to working with you throughout stage 2. I would like to reiterate that it was the Turnbull government and only the Turnbull government that has committed any environmental funding in Swan in the last 10 years.
