        My electorate of Mackellar is filled with magnificent beaches and some incredible surf lifesaving clubs. For years, proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        residents have claimed that we have some of the best beaches in Australia—well, it's not a claim; it's a fact—if not the world. That too is a fact. Yes, it's a huge claim; however, if you've visited one of the many beaches along our peninsular, you may even agree.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our beaches would not be the same without our heroes in yellow and red. They add safety, fun and soul to our beaches. So it came as no surprise to me to hear that the Avalon surf lifesaving club was named the best surf club in Australia for 2017-18. Not only is it visually a work of art; Avalon surf lifesaving club boasts the highest number of patrolling members, with over 313 people, as well as the highest number of collective patrol hours—a staggering 8,787 hours.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club would not be the same without former president and current vice-president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cole" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Richard and fellow club member Robert Hopton were integral in the conception, generation, design and funding of the new Avalon surf lifesaving club. Richard is a highly acclaimed architect and was at the helm of the club's restoration. The design has the history and location of the club in mind. The shape of the roof reflects the abstract form of the sand dunes, and the plane of the ceiling and eaves echoes the plane of the ocean and broad horizontal of the horizon. The building is naturally ventilated and highly insulated. It uses minimal energy and collects its own rainwater and solar power. This award-winning surf lifesaving club is an asset to the community of Mackellar, and I commend Richard and Robert on all their hard work in seeing this project come to fruition.
       </p>

        When accepting the highly coveted award of Club of the Year, Richard said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We're doing incredible things as lifesavers and we really can be the heart and soul of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree more. Richard and all of the team at Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving Club are the heart and soul of our community, as are all lifesavers across Australia. I'm honoured to have people so committed to our community in Mackellar. Richard, I commend you on all your hard work at the club. I look forward to seeing what stunning architectural projects you get up to next.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 20 seconds I have left, I would like to wish this House, all my colleagues here, my community, my family and, in particular, my staff, who do such a good job of making me look good, a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
