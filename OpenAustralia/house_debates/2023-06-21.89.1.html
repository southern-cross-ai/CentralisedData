        My question is to the Minister for Communications. How is the Albanese Labor government's investment in communications infrastructure helping fix connectivity challenges for Australians in rural and regional communities?

         I thank the member for his question. He knows that, if you live in a capital city or in a region, access to fast, reliable, and affordable broadband has never been more important. That's why the Albanese government is supporting the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         to provide thousands of Australians living in rural and regional areas access to faster, unmetered Sky Muster satellite broadband.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a game changer for regional Australia. We know that Australians have never been more data hungry, with more devices consuming more data than ever before. What this new product means is that satellite consumers can get faster downloads of up to 100 megabits per second—unmetered data, 24 hours a day. And that is a first for an NBN consumer satellite product.
        </p>
        <p>
         These improved satellite services have been made possible by this government's $480 million upgrade to the fixed wireless network—upgrades that the Liberals and Nationals talked about but never actually delivered. In contrast, the Albanese government is delivering. Over 400,000 homes and businesses can now access faster internet speeds with this new satellite product, including more than 4,800 in the member for Hunter's own electorate. The honourable member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
          O'Connor
         </a>
         may be pleased to know that there are almost 29,000 premises in his electorate that can benefit from that; and the member for Maranoa may be pleased to know that there are some 20,000 premises in his electorate which will enjoy those faster and more reliable internet speeds. I know that the member for Indi, who has been a passionate advocate for improved connectivity, will be pleased to learn that there are some 11,500 premises in her electorate alone that can benefit from this.
        </p>
        <p>
         This product launch follows the successful trial of over 10,000 customers, who reported greater user satisfaction with higher speeds and uncapped data. It complements the commitment that we made in the October budget to deliver $1.1 billion for rural and regional communications infrastructure. Importantly, that included $656 million to improve mobile and broadband connectivity and resilience, which is so important for rural and regional areas, with $65 million to communities in need to improve their disaster readiness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our work to fix the NBN and to improve regional connectivity comes after nearly a decade of technological and economic incompetence by those opposite, whose multitechnology mix failed the regions, who promised an NBN for $29 billion. It doubled in cost and didn't deliver. This government is delivering.
