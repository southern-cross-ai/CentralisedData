        If you're a young person between the ages of 12 and 25 and you're going through a tough time for any reason, headspace in Bunbury is providing services for you to treat your head right. The centre manager, Marie Eckersley, and her dedicated friendly team are there for you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some years ago, I worked with a group of local people to help secure headspace in Bunbury, which opened in January 2013. Since then it has assisted over 2,700 young people on 16,200 different occasions. Over 32 per cent of those people were 15- to 17-year-olds and 25 per cent were 12- to 14-year-olds. Young people from other towns in the

        have also sought positive assistance from Bunbury headspace. They offer services from social workers, psychologists, a doctor, a nurse, drug and alcohol counsellors and a vocational advisor. They offer workshops, a Youth Connections program and free fitness. There's a headspace app aimed at training your mind for a healthier happier lifeâ€”your own personal trainer, in fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, if you're not ready yet to meet one of these wonderful people face-to-face then eheadspace might be a first step, providing a confidential and free service through web chat, email or phone support with a qualified youth mental health professional. Headspace Bunbury has a youth reference group and a family and friends reference group, and we know how important headspace is in our communities. I would like to thank Marie and everyone involved at Bunbury headspace for the work they do.
