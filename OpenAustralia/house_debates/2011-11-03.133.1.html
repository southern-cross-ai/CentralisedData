       <p>
        Tomorrow I will be hosting another trilevel government meeting in my Bennelong office. The trilevel government meeting is an initiative that I introduced on my entry into parliament last August. It is designed to bring together all three levels of government in Bennelong on a regular basis. By looking past any of the partisan or personal differences that so often set back the ability to achieve real things as representatives, we can discuss and resolve issues of concern to the single most important party of all in our roles, our constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to entering politics I too often shared the frustration felt by so many in our community for the blame game between federal, state and local governments that is used as an excuse for inaction. Most people do not know which health, education or transport issue is covered by the state or federal minister, and they certainly do not care. If there is a pothole in the road, a leaking roof in a hospital or a train line to be completed, they want governments to work together to get it done. The trilevel government meeting is the best way to achieve real results, as it brings together all the major decision makers of the region at the table.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agenda at tomorrow's trilevel government meeting will cover issues ranging from the redevelopment of the Ryde Civic Centre and Epping Town Centre to boarding houses surrounding

        and from the construction of the

        </a>
        and the Epping to Parramatta rail link to resolving the traffic congestion in a region that has some of the most clogged up road arteries in the state. If Bennelong was a living body it would be in cardiac arrest twice a day, five days a week. Directly related to this is a dire need for heavy rail infrastructure, which has been repeatedly promised over 13 years. The North West Rail Link and the Epping to Parramatta rail link are perfect examples of the stark difference between our two types of government. In March this year Premier Barry O' Farrell went to the state election with a 'no strings attached' promise to build the North West Rail Link, which is expected to cost over $7 billion. Within months of winning the election, preconstruction efforts are proceeding at pace.

       <p>
        In August last year, the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, went to the federal election with a $2.1 billion announcement to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link with a volume of out clauses. Funding was promised to commence in 2014-15 which is within the current forward estimates period, yet the project was nowhere to be found in this year's budget papers. Regardless, I have assured the people of Bennelong and my colleagues in the trilevel government meeting that I will hold this government to account for its promises. The trilevel government meeting includes three state government ministers—
