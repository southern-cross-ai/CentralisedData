         All infrastructure has to be built over a phased period. You cannot build it all at once. When you're spending a record $100 billion on infrastructure, you can't spend it all in the one year, but we're getting on with building a better Corangamite. When you look at the investment that we're making in the electorate of the member who asked the question: over $100 million for the Warrnambool Line Upgrade; the duplication of the

         —and I appreciate the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and I have been as one when it comes to road safety and issues on the Princes Highway; I see him nodding—over $82 million for roads from

         </a>
         to Winchelsea and $25 million for the Great Ocean Road Upgrade, which is so significant, because there are many people who want to go and see the

         The million-dollar upgrade to Forest Road and Grays Road at Paraparap mightn't seem like a lot of money to the member for Watson, but every bit of infrastructure spending gets people home sooner and safer. Whether it's rail or whether it's road, whether it's $1 million or whether it's $100 million, we're getting on with building our future—building the people of Australia's future: the Bridges Renewal Program in the Corangamite electorate, $4.3 million; blackspot funding, $6.8 million; and councils within the electorate of the member who asked the question have a 25 per cent increase in Roads to Recovery funding. That wouldn't have happened under those opposite, but it's happening under us. Mayors right throughout Australia are delighted. We've got the Mayor of North Burnett in the gallery. She came to see me this morning and expressed gratitude about roads funding, and we'll work with her to build even more infrastructure and better roads in the

         When there was regional funding under Labor, that went to electorates such as Watson, whose member is so chirpy and always calling out. Let me tell you: the member for Watson does not represent a regional electorate, but under Labor it was considered regional.

          I just say to the Deputy Prime Minister: I think it was fine when he was confining himself to the Corangamite electorate, but a wider character assessment was not part of the question.

           I'll finish the list by just saying: not to mention $2 billion for the Geelong to Melbourne faster rail project, which we'll get on with and do.
