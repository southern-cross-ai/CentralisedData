       <p>
        The election in Tasmania on 15 March revolves around some big issues, the most important of which is who has the best long-term plan for Tasmania. Given the depth of our economic and social malaise after 16 years of Labor and Labor Greens government, Tasmania's recovery will take time and there are no silver bullets. But the Liberal team has a credible plan to change Tasmania for the better. That requires strong, stable majority government to implement a plan that tackles the jobs crisis by backing our competitive strengths in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, mining and tourism; that helps business by cutting red and green tape; that delivers a single, state-wide planning scheme and restores an international shipping service; that rebuilds front-line services and extends high school to year 12; and perhaps most importantly, that fixes the budget mess, cuts waste and makes the public service more efficient.

        and his team have already announced 130 detailed, fully costed and fully funded policies. When the Labor Premier divorced the Greens a few weeks ago, her campaign was all about asking Tasmanians to 'forget about the last four years'. Well, Tasmanians will not forget and realise that we simply cannot afford another Labor Greens government where the minority calls the shots. My message to the people of Bass is that the Liberals are the only party Tasmanians can trust not to do a deal with the Greens. Will Hodgman was the only leader to keep his word on this issue and his vision for Tasmania is the best plan for a brighter future.
