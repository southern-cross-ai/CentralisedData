       <p>
        I rise to speak about a great family-owned business in my electorate that has just celebrated its 80th anniversary. The story of Linke's Bakehouse &amp; Pantry started in the Depression of 1933, when Jack Linke left the family farm to find work in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Barossa Valley
        </a>
        . After five years working in the Barossa, Jack purchased a bakery in Nuriootpa and began the family business that has become so successful today.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1961 Jack decided it was time for one of his four sons to take over the business, and Brian and his wife, Jan, put their hands up to take it over. Brian, Jan and their three children moved into the building that housed the family home, with a retail stop at the front and a bakery at the back. In 1980, it was decided that they would expand the business by converting their family home into an indoor-outdoor dining area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story of Linke's bakery is like many small businesses that are the backbone of this country. From Jack taking a risk and giving it a go in 1938 to the hard work of his family over many decades, from children and grandchildren through to great-grandchildren, Linke's bakehouse has become an iconic Barossa Valley business, situated in the main street of Nuriootpa.
       </p>
       <p>
        My congratulations go to the now matriarch, Jan Linke, her son Chris and his wife, Tamra, as well as Sharon Edward for not only the last 80 years but also continuing this successful business for many future generations.
