        The St George Business Awards is an annual event in the Barton electorate that celebrates the businesses in this wonderful community. I was really pleased to be able to attend this year, along with my wife, to meet all the finalists and the winners, and to present several categories of awards. It is such a great honour to attend an event such as this in my capacity as the federal member, to help celebrate the hard work of the region's many diverse enterprises. As we all know, small businesses are the backbone of our nation. They are the engine room of our economy. That night, I saw our nation's ethos all around the room in the Venus Reception Centre—that if you have a go, you can succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barton has some 13, 000 businesses dedicated to serving the community and beyond. They range from automotive services, personalised services, professional services, hospitality and catering through to health, child care and community based organisations. Many of these businesses are family owned and run by people who work long hours and work tirelessly to retain their customers day in, day out. These businesses are also under pressure from other similar organisations or online based enterprises offering similar goods. Yet these businesses have survived the ebbs and flows of the economy and battle on each day to provide something invaluable for the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        They do not ask for much in return, except to be left alone to run their operations according to the needs they have identified.
       </p>
       <p>
        This means not being burdened by red tape, excessive bureaucracy and spending days in the office pushing paperwork, as opposed to developing and nurturing client and business relations. They want a fair go because they have neither the time nor the resources like big organisations have to dedicate to compliance, accounts keeping, recruitment, advertising and marketing, sales and so forth. For many organisations, the owner and manager is one and the same, the marketer and human resources manager is one and same and the accountant and customer service manager is also one and the same, or within a lean team. Yet, their economic contributions to the local Barton economy and Australia cannot be underestimated. All these businesses want recognition of their hard work and appreciation of their needs in the policies we develop to further assist them, not hinder them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The St George Business Awards is also an excellent opportunity for me to personally speak to many businesses in a celebratory environment, to catch up and see how they are going. Of course, it is a great opportunity to let them know what the coalition is doing to further their entrepreneurial spirit and how we are encouraging them with opportunities of growth and investment rather than burdening them with new rules and legislation that stifle their potential. The budget this year has an outstanding small business package designed to help grow the economy and create jobs. We understand the value of small businesses in the Barton community. This can be said of most small businesses across the country: often they are small enterprises operating locally and employing locally. These organisations need and want greater incentives to continue doing what they love, including tax relief and tax deductions for assets purchased and also access to resources to help run their organisations more efficiently or to mitigate commercial or contractual issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that this side of government has been vital in delivering a multitude of small business packages that will assist organisations in many ways, including a cut of 1.5 per cent for incorporated small businesses and five per cent for unincorporated. Small businesses can also claim an immediate tax deduction for every asset purchased up to the value of $20 000. For example, Shelley, from Admire Florist in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bexley_North" rel="nofollow">
         Bexley North
        </a>
        , the winner of the St George Business Awards in 2014, can now acquire new vans and computers to keep up with local and online demand. In fact, when I visited Shelley's business recently with the Treasurer, she was more than happy to reiterate what a help the small business package in this year's budget has meant for her floristry. Similarly, when we visited Macchina coffee shop in Kingsgrove, the owner, Harry, confirmed exactly what the budget meant for his growing enterprise—in this instance, new cashiers, a new coffee machine, grinder and so forth. Being able to deduct the asset amount straightaway can make a world of difference to small businesses, which are the lifeline of local communities. To be able to reduce tax burden and assist in revenue mean more investment back into the business and stability for its employees. These small business owners are extraordinary individuals. They have taken a risk in bettering their lives and that of their families, and they deserve to be rewarded with adequate support.
