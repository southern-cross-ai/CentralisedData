       <p>
        I have received letters from the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable Leader of the Opposition proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d), I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Throsby, namely:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The urgent need—
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposition members: Where is he?
       </p>
       <p>
        Order! I am reading, and I think it is highly disrespectful to not let me at least read this in silence:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The urgent need for the Government to protect Australian jobs and workers and prevent the exploitation of foreign workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. As the individual proposer of the matter is not present, the matter lapses.

         may, on indulgence, it is quite unusual for another MPI to be selected over one submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. I accept that it is your right to do so. But it is particularly unusual for someone who thought this was so important that it should be the subject of a matter of public importance debate today not to be in the House for this. This is completely, absolutely and utterly unprecedented. It smacks of a set-up, if I may say so, Madam Speaker, and I suggest that—

           , on a point of order: can I say that I think what the Leader of the Opposition was doing was not reflecting on you in any respect but reflecting on the member for Throsby and the government. It is not your fault that the member for Throsby is not in the chamber. Clearly you made a decision. You would not have known that the member for Throsby was not in the chamber when it was called on. It is clearly no reflection on you, and therefore I would ask you to hear the rest of the Leader of the Opposition's statement.

             may, I absolutely agree with the Manager of Opposition Business that there was no reflection intended on you and it would have been disorderly of me to do so. But how could the member for Throsby seriously submit this matter for debate and then absent himself from the House? How could this happen? Under the circumstances I submit that it would be open to you to say, 'Well, really, obviously the matter which is most worthy of debate is that submitted by someone who is actually present in the House.' I suggest that you now put this matter forward for debate.

I am embarrassed, I am ashamed, that you have been put in this position by this Leader of the House and by the absent member, and I believe the only way to protect the dignity of the parliament is for you, Madam Speaker, to revise that decision on the floor from the chair and to put this matter of public importance that I submitted now.
