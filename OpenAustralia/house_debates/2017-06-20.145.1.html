        I did not know that I was coming into the comedy club this afternoon, but that speech from the member for Ryan reminds me of something I saw—which actually was quite funny—down in Melbourne one time. Perhaps more effort on the coalition side could be directed not to their football team but to focusing on what is actually important, which is getting their school funding sorted out.
       </p>

        But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to talk about some of the great things that are happening in my electorate on the back of the amazing people I have the absolute privilege and honour to represent. I wanted to come in here today and mention a bloke called Allen Cullen, who I have known for many, many years. He was recently awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for his service to our community. Allen was the principal of our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSP" rel="nofollow">
         SSP
        </a>
        , Kurrambee, and a teacher for over 50 years. I am absolutely certain that he appreciates the value of needs based funding more than anybody in this place. For many years I thought Allen was still the principal, and I was quite surprised to learn that he was no longer the principal but had stayed at the school as a casual teacher and had become the president of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_By_Little" rel="nofollow">
         Little By Little
        </a>
        , which is the charity set up to support the school's needs and provide the resources they do not get. I would point out that they are going to face a $166,000 funding cut under this new school funding model.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Cullinan also played a crucial part in making sure trampolining became, for the first time, an official Olympic sport, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in 2000.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the week we were not here in parliament, I had the pleasure of visiting Lorraine Stacke and her team at the Nepean Family History Society. Lorraine has been a local historian for many years and has written a book on the history of Penrith. I suggest that that would be compelling reading for anybody in this House, particularly the member for Reid. He might want to look at the great things that are happening out there in Penrith, given that he likes to talk down my area quite frequently. Lorraine Stacke and her team keep great records of local families and land grants as well as other amazing historical data.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also been able to pay a visit to our local seniors and pensioners group, headed up by Grace Brinkley, the president, where I had the absolute pleasure of being their guest speaker. Nobody fell asleep on the day, so I take that as a win. These were hardworking pensioners who were relying on the government for help in their retirement as a way of being thanked for the work that they have done in our community over a great number of years. On the way out of there, a very sprightly young woman passed me, and she said, 'Just don't ever get old, love.' As she passed, she said, 'I'm only 98.' I was quite surprised to see how very fit she still was at 98.
