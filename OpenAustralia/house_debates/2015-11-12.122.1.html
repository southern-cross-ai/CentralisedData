In the year ended June 2014, tourism contributed over $1 billion—or four per cent—to Tasmania's economy: 15,000 direct jobs and 22½ thousand indirect jobs in our state. In 2014-15, international visitors to Tasmania were up 22 per cent to 198,000, with China being the largest of those markets. So it was that on Friday, 6 November, at the
