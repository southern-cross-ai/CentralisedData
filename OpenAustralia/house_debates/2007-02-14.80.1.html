         I thank the member for Hughes for her question and note that the unemployment rate in the great electorate of Hughes is now down to 3.1 per cent. Once upon a time they said five per cent was full employment, but in the electorate of Hughes it is 3.1 per cent. It would not have happened under

           That is right—a few of them. One of the reasons for that is that this government believe in helping families and we want to encourage women in particular to enter the workplace and to give them the choice of either staying at home with their families or, on occasions, going into the workplace. Since we were elected to government in 1996, one million more women have entered the workplace in Australia. There has been a 35 per cent increase in part-time work, participation rates are at all-time highs and the pay gap between men and women has narrowed. So we are getting to a better position in relation to the pay gap. In fact, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum" rel="nofollow">

           <i>
            Global gender gap report 2006
           </i>
           described Australia as a leader in closing the gender gap.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is all in addition to our other initiatives in which we have doubled the number of childcare places, introduced and extended the family tax benefit, introduced the baby bonus, introduced the childcare benefit and provided up to $4,000 in tax deductibility for child care, helping to provide choice for Australian families.
          </p>

           The interesting thing is that under the Labor Party between 1993 and 1996—and note that their workplace changes were made in 1993 by

           —the last three years of Labor, the wages gap between men and women grew; and it has narrowed under the coalition. That is what happens when you have a centralised system. That is what happens when you have an inflexible workplace system that does not take into account the aspirations of women. The Labor Party now want to return to that system. I note that

This is the ‘independent analyst’. But, wait, there is more. Professor Peetz, the independent expert, writes poetry for the Workers Online website, the official organ of Unions

                        It comes back to the point that you have to judge people not by what they say but by what they do. The coalition has been about helping Australian families in the workplace, through the tax system and with family benefits. The Labor Party is about getting these concocted reports put together by flawed academics and parading them as a new paradigm for women in the workplace. The coalition is about getting more women into work if they choose to do so, providing them with better pay and better opportunities and helping Australian families.
