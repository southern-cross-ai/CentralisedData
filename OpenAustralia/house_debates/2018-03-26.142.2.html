        I associate myself with the words from the member for Perth and acknowledge the leadership by Senator 'Wacka' Williams from the other place in that delegation.

       <p>
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the following reports: the first report of 2018 concerning referrals made in the year 2017 and the
        <i>
         Eighty-first annual report (2017)
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present two reports—the first is a report for 2018 and the second is the 81st annual report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first report of 2018 looks at four proposals referred to the committee over the course of last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first proposal is the Engine Test Cell 1 Upgrade at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley. This involves enhancing the existing engine test cell to enable it to test the new F-35 engines, as well as the engines of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hornets" rel="nofollow">
         Super Hornets
        </a>
        and Growlers. This will be the only test facility for F-35 engines in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . The project cost estimate is $23.7 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . I can report to the House that that facility will also be a cost-recovery facility for other air force facilities around the Southern Hemisphere that want to come and test their engines, and we will pick up some coin out of that on cost recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second proposal is for the Joint Health Command Garrison Health Facilities Upgrade Project. The project proposes to deliver 13 fit-for-purpose health centres across Australia, constructing eight new health centres and refurbishing an existing five. In making this recommendation, the committee recognises the importance of suitable health facilities in enabling defence capability. The project cost estimate is $212.5 million, excluding GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third proposal is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP" rel="nofollow">
         JP
        </a>
        157 Replacement Aviation Refuelling Vehicles Infrastructure Project. This project will provide new and upgraded infrastructure at 15 sites to accommodate replacement aviation refuelling vehicles, including new vehicle shelters, bunding around fuel tanks which is designed to contain fuel leaks, hardstand and roads, and fuel treatment facilities. The project cost estimate is $40.4 million, excluding GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final project is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEA" rel="nofollow">
         SEA
        </a>
        1654 Phase 3 Maritime Operational Support Capability Facilities Project. This project will provide suitable facilities and infrastructure to support the new supply ships which will be based on the west coast at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Stirling
        </i>
        and on the east coast at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Garden Island
        </a>
        in Sydney. The project estimate is $220.5 million, excluding GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that the four proposed projects should proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also present the committee's 81st annual report, which reports on the committee's activities for the 2017 calendar year. In summary, it was a busy year for the committee. Twenty-four projects were reported on, with a total combined value of more than $2.03 billion. The committee also had a significant increase in medium works projects, examining 147 proposals, with a total value of $718 million. The committee held 45 meetings during the year, in Canberra and at locations around Australia. May I suggest that one of the more successful meetings we held was in the member for Griffith's electorate, where we held a public forum at the request of the member, and I think, from feedback from your constituents, the meeting was well appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge the exceptional work that is undertaken by the secretariat. In the chamber here at the moment we have Pauline Cullen, and not in the chamber is a gentleman who is a powerhouse of work for us—James Bunce. James, we wish you the very best and a speedy recovery to get your feet back under the desk as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        also say that, when we are examining projects, the committee looks for best practice in looking for value for money. In turn, when we are examining the cost of getting the committee to projects right around Australia, we will create subcommittees, and those that are situated on the west coast will often go and do inspections on projects, without any regard for what side of the House they sit on. When you sit in this Public Works Committee, your opinion is valued. There have been a number of occasions where members of the opposition have gone, as part of a subcommittee, and come back and made diligent recommendations which have been wholeheartedly accepted. I only highlight that to show the collegial spirit that exists when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and having an open, fair and transparent process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank my fellow committee members for all their hard work during the year of 2017. As chair, I appreciate firsthand the work of every individual and the collegial way in which we work. Their commitment and valued contribution to the work of the committee is appreciated. In closing, I want to acknowledge some of the members of the committee who will no longer sit on that committee, who have been elevated because of their exceptional skill sets. I speak of Mr David Coleman, the member for Banks, and Senator Dean Smith, from the other place, who's stepping down to take up another role. He's a former chair of this committee, and his experience will be greatly missed. I commend the report to the House.
