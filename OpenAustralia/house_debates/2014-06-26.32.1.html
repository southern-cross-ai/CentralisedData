        Taking a dip in the ocean early on a winter's morning might not seem like a great idea to some, especially in Tasmania. But last Sunday more than 50 daredevils braved the icy waters to participate in the Boat Harbour Beach Surf Life Saving Club's annual Polar Bear Swim. Boat Harbour is a small but seaside community in my electorate. The Boat Harbour lifesaving club holds an important place in our community. Nationally, volunteer lifesavers have saved more than 600,000 lives since 1907.

        Now in its sixth year, the Polar Bear Swim is conducted annually on the winter solstice and, thankfully, the temperature this year was a balmy 15 degrees. Anyone brave enough can enter. There is only one rule: no wetsuits. Most opt for a costume with as many layers as possible. This year there were cowboys, businessmen, ghostsâ€”you name it. Participants have the option to take a 50-metre swim or wade in shallow water.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am yet to decide what option I will take next year, but I am looking for suggestions on costume ideas. Maybe the Prime Minister can lend me a pair of red togs! That last sentence was in fact cheekily inserted into my speech by my staffer Stephanie, in Burnie. She thought I wouldn't spot it, so I hope she enjoys her very long vacation!

        This event is not just about finding out who is brave enough to enter the icy waters. It is a very important event on the calendar. Well done to the Boat Harbour Beach Surf Life Saving Club.
