       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to Patricia Fallas for her herculean 50 years of service to Meals on Wheels in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        community. Volunteers play a critical role in helping shape our society and build stronger communities, and the dedication of volunteers like Patricia is to be highly commended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pat's journey with Meals on Wheels began in 1964, when she agreed to fill a shift for another volunteer. She was soon a permanent fixture. When Pat began her journey of volunteerism, she was accompanied by her four-year-old daughter, Karen, as she worked in the kitchen helping to prepare what was then 39 meals a day. Pat has seen many changes over the years, and has always enjoyed the camaraderie of her fellow volunteers on her fortnightly Monday shift. By 1995, Mount Gambier Meals on Wheels had moved to a newer, larger kitchen to help cater to increased demand. Pat has continued to always maintain high standards in preparing meals. As she has said on numerous occasions, she would never serve to a client anything she would not eat herself. In July 2010, the Mount Gambier branch of Meals on Wheels served its one-millionth meal, which Pat had the privilege of preparing and serving.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pat epitomises the values of volunteer. She is passionate, she is dedicated and, notwithstanding her advancing years, she has remained enthusiastic during each and every shift. Pat has been an outstanding contributor to Meals on Wheels and, as such, a great asset to the community of Mount Gambier.
