        Like the member for Hasluck, I was very proud to host an Indigenous year 11 student as part of the Learn Earn Legend Work Exposure program this week. Connor Watson spent two days learning the ropes and seeing what life in this place is like. I asked that Connor write a few words about his time with me and my office. I am happy to read those into

        I did some office work and I learnt about the issues facing people in our electorate of Robertson.

        I have known Connor over many years. He was the absolute gun rugby player who joined my son's under-seven team at the Sharks at Avoca.
