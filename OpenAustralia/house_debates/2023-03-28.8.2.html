        The Health Insurance Amendment (Prescribed Dental Patients and Other Measures) Bill 2023 seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 with three administrative changes, which are supported by the coalition. The bill will improve access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule for eligible persons requiring treatment for cleft and craniofacial conditions by removing the age restriction, which is currently 22 years. Schedule 2 enables Services Australia to use a computerised system to action decisions made by a specified body to place doctors on and remove doctors from the Register of Approved Placements. Schedule 3 is a technical amendment that relates to the Bonded Medical Program, rectifying inconsistencies and the length of a bonded participant's return-of-service obligation between the act and the rule, and making other related amendments to enhance the administration of the program.
       </p>
       <p>
        This legislation arose following the findings of the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce report on the cleft dental services
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBS" rel="nofollow">
         NBS
        </a>
        items in 2020. It suggested that the current age limit of 22 years for eligible persons requiring treatment for cleft and craniofacial conditions be lifted. Age limits for access to the scheme were initially established on the basis that patients with cleft and craniofacial conditions would generally have completed most specialist dental work associated with their condition once their facial growth was completeâ€”on average, at 22 years of age. However, there continues to be a small number of patients who are denied treatment on the basis of the age limit in circumstances where that treatment would be clinically beneficial to the patient's condition and general health. This bill will also serve the important purpose of enabling patients who have had their surgeries deferred beyond the age of 22 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to access Medicare benefits for the treatment they require. Cleft lip or palate conditions affect one in every 800 babies born in Australia. This bill will not significantly alter average patient numbers, but will nevertheless support improvements to patient treatment plans to ensure support is available for those affected by these conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government has stated that this bill will strengthen Medicare by making it fair and equitable for young people needing cleft palate and craniofacial procedures to access those procedures regardless of their age. The coalition absolutely supports the intention of this bill to improve access to affordable and life-changing procedures for those Australians impacted by these conditions and to ensure increased access to critical health care through Medicare. However, if the government is serious about strengthening Medicare and improving access to affordable and potentially life-changing or life-saving health care then they must pursue further urgent action to do so. The Strengthening Medicare Taskforce report, released by the government, whilst clear on the problems facing primary care in Australia, contains no specific actions, no funding and no time lines. Disappointingly, the report had no urgency. There's nothing in the report to address the immediate challenge facing our health system, which is workforce shortages. For months and months we have seen the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Aged Care talk about the crisis in health care and the workforce shortages that are putting significant pressures on the system. But we have not seen any tangible plan from the government to address this critical issue. In fact, all this government has done to date is weaken our Medicare system. Bulk-billing levels, which were at a record high when the coalition left government, have dropped because the health minister has broken confidence in the system by prioritising politics over healthcare outcomes. The government has cut hospital funding and slashed Medicare subsidised mental health support in half. They have ripped doctors out of rural, regional and remote Australia by changing the distribution priority areas for overseas trained doctors, and they have cut 70 telehealth items from Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a time when Australians are struggling with skyrocketing energy prices, mortgage repayments and grocery bills, we're now seeing the cost of going to the doctor skyrocketing too. Following the release of the report, the opposition has called on the government to immediately provide the time lines and details of the funding required to ease the pressure on Australia's hardworking doctors and nurses. The government needs to stop talking about the challenges facing Australians and start doing something about them. Actions speak louder than words; all we have seen from the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce report is just more words and still no actions. Aspirations are commendable, but without urgent action to follow they're not going to assist Australians with the significant cost-of-living pressures that are only continuing to rise. It's $55 for a script and $60 out of pocket for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , all while energy bills are increasing and inflation is skyrocketing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition has remained absolutely committed to ensuring the sustainability of Medicare and that all Australians have access to Australia's world-class to health system. In government, the coalition increased Medicare funding every year. Total annual funding for Medicare increased under the coalition from $19 billion to $36 billion a year, increasing by over $1 billion annually.
       </p>
       <p>
        The introduction of universal telehealth under the former coalition government was also the most significant reform to Medicare since it was established. This saw more than one hundred million telehealth services delivered under the coalition, ensuring greater and more flexible access to healthcare support for over 17 million Australians, including those in rural and regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government does not have a plan to address the critical workforce shortages in Australia's healthcare sector, particularly relating to general practice. Once again, we support the administrative improvements that are being introduced through this bill, particularly the affordable access to critical procedures that this legislation will provide to more young Australians impacted by cleft palate and craniofacial conditions. However, we will call on the government to follow up the release of their Strengthening Medicare Taskforce report with urgent tangible action to address the issues currently facing our healthcare system. I thank the House.
