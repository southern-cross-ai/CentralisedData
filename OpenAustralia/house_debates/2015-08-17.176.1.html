        Congratulations to all the winners and the nominees, especially to the winner of the award for best community or social service non-profit organisation, which was Tweed Palliative Support, who also won the award for best business overall. Thanks also to the many sponsors and for the general community support for this great event. I would like to acknowledge the organisers, Toni Zuschke and Natascha Wernick, both of whom did an outstanding job again in showcasing the local business community and arranging a truly magnificent evening.

        It is also important to note that all of the produce and businesses sourced for this event are from the Tweed Shire. Special mention must also go to Jonathan, Mel and all the team from Ju Ju's restaurant, who provided the outstanding three-course meal for the event. Also, the performers were just fantastic, especially local superstar 17-year-old Nina Baumer, who recently appeared on the
