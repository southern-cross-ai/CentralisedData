       <p>
        I rise today to record my opposition to a proposed high-rise development in my community at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Lake" rel="nofollow">
         Forest Lake
        </a>
        and to place on record my support for the Forest Lake action group, who are leading the charge to stop this development and this eyesore and this ridiculous development from going ahead. Forest Lake is a beautiful local suburb which many families, seniors and young people call home. You'll find people around the lake. You'll hear the voices of children and couples taking their pets for a walk around the edges of a late afternoon as the sun sets over the majestic waters. But this is now under serious threat.

        An eight-storey development has been planned adjacent to the lake which will overshadow what has always been a scenic community meeting place. So far the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        council has remained silent on this development. The LNP planning boss in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        , Councillor Julian Simmons, has been far too busy stacking the branches in the member for Ryan's electorate to remove a hard-working representative of this place.

        The member for Mackellar is another person who took out a woman on that side of the chamber. This LNP believe they have too many women in parliament as it speaks. With the removal of the member for Ryan, this will leave one Liberal woman in the House of Representatives from Queensland. Everyone opposite thinks that's acceptable. I'm here to say the Labor Party says that's not acceptable. We will keep fighting for the rights of women, not only for their voices to be heard but to serve in this parliament—
