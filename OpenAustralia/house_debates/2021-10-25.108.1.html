        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister fail to make every effort to properly consult Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, on his national strategy to prevent child sexual abuse?

         Mr Speaker, I'm going to ask the

          Special Minister of State
         </a>
         to respond to this question, because there has been a misunderstanding of this issue. He has responsibility as Special Minister of State in terms of the child protection office to address that matter which has been raised by the member.

          The national strategy development has been made possible through the incredible work and insights of those who have contributed to it. Consultations have been made with victim-survivors of child sexual abuse, their advocates, Aboriginal and

          peoples, people with disabilities and the Australian children's commissioners.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to the Australian of the Year: in March, the head of the National Office of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Safety" rel="nofollow">
           Child Safety
          </a>
          had an informal introductory meeting with Ms Tame in Canberra to discuss the national strategy. In March, the head of the National Office of Child Safety emailed Ms Tame about how she might work with the National Office of Child Safety in relation to the strategy. On 13 May I spoke to Ms Tame, to talk to her about the measures in the budget that form part of national strategy. In May, further, the National Office of Child Safety emailed Ms Tame to advise her of the national strategy commitments; that was to anticipate further activity of Ms Tame, including her advocacy on these issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          Further in May, the Healing Foundation, on behalf of the National Office of Child Safety, emailed Ms Tame to invite her to attend a consultation workshop on 10 June about these issues for victim-survivors. A follow-up email was sent. On 14 June, I personally travelled to Tasmania with the head of the National Office of Child Safety to meet with Ms Tame. The position and role that I take as the minister responsible for the National Office of Child Safety, and the work I've done in relation to the national strategy, was one that has been informed by Ms Tame's meeting with me and her engagement with our officials. I thank her for the insight on those issues. But, also, there is the fact that I had concerns and reservations about some of the elements of the strategy. Grace and I spoke about those and she actually assisted me in understanding the importance of them; that will be announced this week.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 20 October, the National Office of Child Safety emailed Ms Tame to make sure she participates and to invite her to the launch later this week. As a result of media discussions on this issue, there has been further interaction with Ms Tame to ensure that she can participate with other victim-survivors in relation to the national strategy launch. Subsequently, in relation to tweets from the Leader of the Opposition, on Friday afternoon I reached out to his chief of staff to inform him of some of these engagements with the Australian of the Year.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to the national strategy: it is an important issue and victim-survivors deserve it to be above politics.
