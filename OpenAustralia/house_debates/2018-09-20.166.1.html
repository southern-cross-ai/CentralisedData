I'd like to acknowledge and honour each of those players, including: captain, Zac Hunt; man of the match, Ty-Lee Simmonds; try scorers Mackenzie Atkins, Finlay Grabham and Noah Griffiths; Matthew Cole, who was awarded most improved for the Bathurst Panthers at their presentation night recently; Elijah Sharwood, who received the Bathurst Panthers coaches' award;

        The Bathurst Panthers reserve grade side fought all season to make it to the grand final, but unfortunately they were unsuccessful. It was a tough game against the rival Bathurst St Pat's side, who emerged victorious after 80 minutes with a score of 27-14. Well done to the boys on an incredible game nonetheless. I'd like to acknowledge: Marcus Turnbull; Ben Dolan;

         Premier League
        </a>
        side: the Bathurst Panthers took home the title in the Premier League division with a 12-10 win over the Cowra Magpies. This was the first time since 2007 that the Panthers had made the grand final. The game did not get off to an easy start as they were facing the Cowra Magpies, who had a game advantage. The grand final was a race to the clock, as the sides were only a few points apart the entire game. The premiership was only secured in the dying minutes, and it all came down to a last-minute try by the Panthers that relied on a successful conversion that had to be taken from the sideline. Five-eighth and goal kicker Willie Wright lined up the tee and kicked the footy—kicked the pill—straight through the goal posts in what will go down as one of the best moments in the Bathurst Panthers' history!

        Congratulations to the team, including captain coach, Doug Hewitt, who made his debut as coach this year and is also the youngest coach in the competition at just 24 years of age—well done, Doug. Brent Seager was awarded the Dave Scott Medal for player of the match and took the Bathurst Panthers best and fairest award and Wilmer Asher Ward—well done, Brent. The try scorers were Blake Hewitt and Andrew Mendes—good on you, guys. Callum Young was named the most improved at the club's presentation night. Jed Betts took home the coaches award. Luke Bain was named player's player for the 2018 season and won the Guys Weeks Memorial Trophy. Congratulations to Josh Rivett, Blake Lawson, Jye Barrow, Kade Barrow, Nick Loader, Dane Thorogood, Blake Seager, Jack Siejka, Kara Rotarangi and Trent Hotham. Well done to the support team, who included manager Danny Dwyer—well done, Danny; head trainer Kevin Franklin; and trainers Tony Davis and Grant Walsh. Grant was named club man of the year.
