        Great Eastern Wine Week runs from 8 to 17 September, so book your tickets to Tasmania today. Great Eastern Wine Week showcases some of Tasmania's finest wines along the beautiful 221-kilometre coastal stretch of my electorate, a coast that includes—but is in no way limited to—Orford, Freycinet and the Bay of Fires. More than 40 events will take place over the 10-day festival, providing visitors an opportunity to sample Australia's best cool climate wines at wineries and other venues and pair them with produce, including the coast's stunning oysters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Visitors will also be able to meet passionate winemakers while taking in the stunning landscapes, working their way south from

        . Sensibly, buses are available for anyone who would like to try more than a sample, and they're well recommended.

        The wine industry in Tasmania contributes more than $200 million to our economy and employs more than 2,000 full-time workers, so it's serious business. You're not going just for the fun of it; you're going to support the economy. That's important to remember!
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, this week is Tasmanian Whisky Week. As a co-convener of the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Spirits, I'm pleased to say: book your tickets to Tasmania today for the weekend, enjoy the whisky and then come back on 8 September for Great Eastern Wine Week.
