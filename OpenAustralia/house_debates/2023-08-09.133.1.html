       <p>
        My electorate of Hawke is much younger than the rest of the country. The issues that are important to us are vastly different from many others across our country. We're a rapidly growing seat on Melbourne's growing outer western fringe. We have the fastest growing council area in Melton and a booming multicultural population. To try to deal with some of the challenges we face, it's important that we listen to the voices of our young people in our communities. And we've been doing just that in Hawke.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hawke Youth Advisory Committee is a group of 10 young people, from the Hawke electorate, who have come forward and are ready to have their voices heard by the Australian government. The members of this committee are dedicated to raising awareness for issues important to them and other young people in our community. They have been attending regular meetings to raise these issues directly with me, and I have then, in turn, been raising their issues directly, here, in Canberra, whether it's mental health in schools, opportunities in education, pathways to the workforce or climate change and so much more.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great opportunity for them when consultations for the Albanese government's new youth engagement strategy opened. The committee has put forward a submission providing insight into the life of young people and the issues affecting them in our community. This committed group have given me an opportunity to better understand how the young people of Hawke are affected by the decisions that we make every day up here, what we need to do to address these tissues and how we can best work with them to solve the relevant problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank, very much, Minister Anne Aly for her generosity and commitment to listening to the voices of our young people. She will be making time to meet with the group next week, to discuss their submission in more detail. I also thank all the committee members for their hard work and dedication in making sure that we are hearing their concerns loud and clear. I look forward to working with them well into the future.

        was a larger-than-life figure who left a lasting mark on our community in Hawke. I could reel off the extraordinary list of her awards and achievements, all worthy of mention. However, while I know Lyn was very proud of her accomplishments, what drove her every single day was her family, her friends and her tireless work in our community. If you happen to find yourself in our neck of the woods, take a quick trip down to

        . The trees you walk amongst will have been planted by Lyn and her dedicated band of volunteers and workers, thousands of trees all lovingly nurtured and cared for, a living memorial for Lyn that will stand for decades to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's more than one string to Lyn's bow. Over the years, she welcomed many people on community based orders, teaching them life skills and imparting her wisdom through her tree-planting program. She never judged, and she was always happy to have another pair of hands to help with the tree-planting effort. She was also a fierce advocate for people living with a disability, drawing on her own life experience of caring for her beloved daughter, Simone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Melton was more than just Lyn's home town. Melton was her life, and our community embraced her. As a testament to how much Lyn meant to our community, the flags in

        flew at half-mast on the day she was laid to rest. Those who knew Lyn knew what an extraordinary powerhouse she was. Never one to take a step back, Lyn grabbed life with both hands. In her own words: 'Anything can be done, bit by bit. Find your niche. Never be afraid!'
       </p>
       <p>
        Lyn will be very fondly remembered by the Melton
