        In between sitting weeks here in parliament, I made the dash home to the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        and was able to take part in one of my favourite activities. Bright and early on Saturday morning, the SAHSSI 30 Walk was on. SAHSSI 30 is a fundraising walk to raise awareness and to support women and children escaping domestic violence. Importantly, funds raised go to support the Nowra women's refuge and supported accommodation. I'm pleased to say this is my third SAHSSI 30 Walk. I love the SAHSSI 30 for another reason as well: it is about getting outside, breathing in the South Coast salt air, feeling the sand and hearing the waves. You just can't help but admire the beautiful surrounds of our bush,

        </a>
        and our natural environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The SAHSSI 30 is a 30-kilometre coastal walk that goes from Huskisson along the glorious beaches of Jervis Bay and into

         Booderee National Park
        </a>
        . We go through Plantation Point, Nelson Beach, Blenheim Beach, Greenfield Beach, Chinamans Beach and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyams_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Hyams Beach
        </a>
        and through

        <i>

        to Captains Beach and then through Iluka Beach and Iluka reserve to the 15-kay turning point.
       </p>
       <p>
        I always say to people: if you get the chance to do the SAHSSI 30 Walk, always do. It is for a brilliant cause, and the walk is one of the most scenic you will ever find. Thirty kilometres might seem a long way, but when you put one foot in front of another and have the good company of fellow walkers like Deb, the time sure does fly by. But it doesn't matter how far you walk. You can walk a little or a lot. I had many great conversations and met new people as well. It's at this stage that you are reminded of the many people in our community that work day in and day out to support women and children faced with and escaping domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Coast Police District were represented as well. They, of course, do the most vital work and work hand in hand with SAHSSI. The walk goes through HMAS
        <i>

        . Special thanks to HMAS
        <i>
         Creswell
        </i>
        for allowing this to happen. I'm pleased to report that, once you reach Iluka Beach and then Iluka reserve, there is a delicious morning tea put on by Jervis Bay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        , which is code for more enjoyment and talking with people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to sincerely thank SAHSSI; SAHSSI 30 Walk organiser Jo Warren; and the SAHSSI All Stars. Thanks to Radio 2ST for their support, and, of course, thank you to all walkers and everyone supporting SAHSSI 30. One foot in front of the other, together, we are working to support women and children escaping domestic violence.
