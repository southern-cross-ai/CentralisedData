        My wife, Catherine; daughter, Georgina; mother, Eileen; three sisters, Denise, Robyn and Julieanne; mother-in-law, Beverley; and her mother, Joan, all attended Mount Erin at

        s' arrival in Wagga Wagga was celebrated. Indeed, Australia owes a great debt of gratitude to those five valiant women who, in early 1874, left the country of their birth, Ireland, to make their way to live on the other side of the world. They were
