       <p>
        Recently I welcomed the Treasurer to the electorate of Hindmarsh for the dedication of a plane for the

        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFDS" rel="nofollow">
         RFDS
        </a>
        's new plane is, for all intents and purposes, a flying intensive care unit. The $7 million aircraft is the first of five new medically equipped Pilatus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        12 aircraft to replace some of their ageing aircraft. It features state-of-the art avionics and emergency services and will replace their current aircraft which for the past 13 years has transferred more than 10,000 patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Treasurer was delighted to announce the $2.7 million contribution by the Commonwealth government towards this landmark capital project. As part of the announcement, there was a special donation of $600,000 by the Hackett Foundation to fund the medical fit-out that converted this aircraft into a flying intensive care unit.

        was on hand as a representative of the foundation, and I congratulate him for his generosity. This is a major philanthropic outlay and I applaud Mr Hackett for donating some of the money that he made from the sale of his

        business, Internode, to help those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The RFDS also receive significant support from corporate sponsors, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        Billiton and Oz Minerals among others. Over the last two years I have supported and attended the RFDS Wings for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Ball" rel="nofollow">

        , another of the many fundraising activities for the organisation. I thank Charlie Patterson and his team for their fundraising activities and look forward to supporting them in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, like many organisations, the RFDS will need community support over the coming years but, under the leadership of Chairman David Hills and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        John Lynch and their team, I am sure they will continue to succeed in delivering a world-class service.
