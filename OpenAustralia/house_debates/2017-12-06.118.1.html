        I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Singapore, Myanmar and Indonesia from 2 to 13 July 2017. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.

       <p>
        Leave granted.

        In July of this year, a delegation comprising the members for Flynn and Herbert, Senator Kimberley Kitching and I participated in a delegation to three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        nations, namely Singapore, Myanmar and Indonesia. Australia's economic and security interests remain inextricably linked with the countries of South-East Asia. In recognition of this, the aim of the annual Australian parliamentary visit to the Association of South-East Asian Nations, ASEAN, is to gain a better understanding of developments in ASEAN countries and to examine opportunities to broaden links with these countries. This will focus on, firstly, economic development, including responses to global economic issues and opportunities to strengthen trade and investment links; secondly, the environment, including policies and initiatives to meet the challenges of climate change; thirdly, security, including defence cooperation and responses to the threat of terrorism; fourthly, cooperation within the multilateral system; and, finally, social development, including community health and education.
       </p>

        In 2017, ASEAN is celebrating its 50th anniversary. ASEAN was formed in 1967 by the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Membership has been expanded over the years to also include Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar. Australia became ASEAN's first dialogue partner in 1974 and entered into a free trade agreement with ASEAN and

        </a>
        in 2010. Australia's strategic partnership with ASEAN delivers important economic and security benefits to Australia. As a group, ASEAN is Australia's third-largest trading partner and Australia is working closely with ASEAN nations in important areas such as counterterrorism cooperation and maritime security. In 2018, Australia will host the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Sydney, the first time Australia has hosted a summit with ASEAN leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the ASEAN delegation visited Singapore, Myanmar and Indonesia. The program was comprehensive and it facilitated insights into Australia's trade and investment, security and defence development cooperation, and people-to-people relationships across all three countries as well as broader issues facing the region and the opportunities to strengthen Australia's engagement at the bilateral and regional level. It is clear from the visit that Australia is regarded as a valued, constructive and practical partner by our ASEAN neighbours in an era of rapid change and uncertainty. The delegation was warmly received in all three countries by parliamentary colleagues, national and local government officials, business groups, religious leaders and local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an avenue for deepening mutual understanding, the annual parliamentary delegation remains a very important part of Australia's overall engagement with the countries of South-East Asia. It allows Australian parliamentarians to engage in a dialogue with their peers in different ASEAN countries, as well as with partner government officials, business experts, non-government organisations and local communities with whom Australia is working to advance our shared interest to ensure a secure, stable and prosperous region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation has stated in its report that it believes there are several ways these visits could be further strengthened. First, we believe that, at the commencement of each visit program, future delegations would benefit from a briefing by the ASEAN mission in Jakarta on Australia's overall regional engagement strategies. This could be held either in Jakarta or remotely prior to departure. Second, the opposition and the government may wish to consider appointing a standing delegation member for the term of each parliament to allow for greater continuity and follow-up on issues from year to year. Finally, we believe there may be value in considering whether future delegation visits should be timed to coincide with meetings of the ASEAN Inter-

        </a>
        , of which Australia is an observer member, in order to maximise the delegations' interaction with regional parliamentarians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the delegation wishes to express its appreciation of the work that went into preparing for the visit, including the support provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        , the International and Parliamentary Relations Office and the Parliamentary Library. The delegation would also like to thank Australia's heads of mission and all of their mission staff in Singapore, Yangon and Jakarta, for their work in developing the programs and for the excellent support and hospitality provided during the visits. Finally, I would like to thank the delegation secretary, Dr Cameron Hill, for all his work in preparation for the visit, during the visit of the delegation and, subsequently, in the preparation of this report. I commend the report to the House.
