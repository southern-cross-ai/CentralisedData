        Now for something completely different. I would like to introduce a very special guest today. This is Maisie, the travelling koala, from Midson Road Childcare Centre at Epping. She is named after Maisie Ward Nungurrayi, who designed the beautiful material that Maisie is made of.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the highlights of Maisie's time in parliament this week was meeting the Prime Minister. Maisie, being the passionate and politically engaged koala that she is, thanked the Prime Minister and the government for making childhood education more affordable and for all the work government is now doing to protect her natural habitat. She also sat in on some very important meetings. She observed everything very quietly and attentively, and everyone has been impressed by her listening skills. She thinks some people in politics could learn a thing or two from her. Maisie was a bit disappointed when I forgot to take her to see the

        Women's World Cup Trophy in parliament, but I told her not to worry, because I'm sure it'll be staying here in Australia for the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm grateful for Maisie's attendance this week. Being a koala, she served as a constant reminder of how important it is to look after Australia's precious wildlife and our ecosystems. I'd like to thank Maisie and all the wonderful kids, parents and childcare workers at Midson Road for letting me bring her down this week. I'm sure she'll have a great time sharing her stories with friends and family back home.
