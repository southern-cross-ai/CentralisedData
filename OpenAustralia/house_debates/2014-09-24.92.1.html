        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on the measures taken to secure defence force members and their families?

         I thank the member for Hughes for his question and his ever-present interest in the welfare of our fighting men and women. I also note the significance of this question to the 105 members of the House of Representatives whose electorates are home to Defence men and women and their respective families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to reassure all of our people, whether they are members of the military or those serving as civilian employees, or their families, that they should have complete confidence as they go about their daily lives. The government is taking its security responsibilities seriously. As the Prime Minister has stated previously, we are doing whatever is possible to keep them safe. As the House would be aware, Defence has raised the alert level at our defence bases and establishments to Safe Base Charlie. This is the third of five graduated levels, and it is consistent with the change to the national terrorism public alert level.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measures undertaken in response to the increase in the safe base alert level to Charlie are location-specific and base-specific across the country. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
          CDF
         </a>
         , using all available channels, has already communicated to every one of our Defence members and their families what these changes entail, and the need to remain vigilant in the current security environment. We are being prudent and responsible, with well-established measures and protocols, in response to a very fluid security environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to reassure Defence members and their families of the government's commitment to their safety. I ask that our people go about their daily lives as normally as possible, but with prudence and responsibility, and, if in doubt, as the CDF has communicated contact the

         </a>
         police commissioner and the head of the Defence Security Agency to ensure the continued safety of our people remains top of mind. The current circumstances and the safety of our people are receiving the highest ministerial priorities, and I thank the various agencies we are working with for their professionalism and their speed.
        </p>
        <p>
         For our Defence members and their families, please continue to familiarise yourself with the CDF's online messages, which contain important information and contact details for relevant authorities. Information will be updated as regularly as required. Please also keep an update on the CDF's Facebook page, if you have not done so already. I encourage you to 'like' his page as it will contain the most up-to-date and current information and news.
        </p>
        <p>
         I appreciate that the operational tempo of our forces may well increase in the coming weeks, and I thank our men and women for the speed and the professionalism of their response to the government's requirements. The nation is extraordinarily proud of all of them. I also appreciate that there is a toll on families. I again reassure you that the government and the Defence leadership will do everything possible to ensure your safetyâ€”as those of you who serve ensure ours.
