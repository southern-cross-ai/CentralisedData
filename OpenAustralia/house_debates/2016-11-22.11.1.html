        This Friday marks the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence campaign. It will also be the launch of the Prosecute, Don't Perpetuate campaign, helping to end impunity for sexual violence in armed conflict. The campaign calls for the investigation and prosecution of sexual violence perpetrated by people who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with Daesh. We know that Daesh has used sexual violence as a tactic of war. Sexual violence is a war crime and we should treat it as such. The occurrence of systematic rape is well documented in Iraq in Syria. It is a crime against humanity and we should treat it as such.

        Human Rights Council has published reports of Daesh's intentions to impose 'measures to prevent Yazidi children from being born'. This is genocide and we should treat it as such. By some accounts, over 100 Australians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with Daesh and other extremist groups. We need to investigate and prosecute the sexual violence they have perpetrated as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, for these are all crimes under domestic Australian legislation. These crimes create victims, and these victims deserve justice. This is violence against women. These women deserve justice.

        In finishing I want to acknowledge Susan Hutchinson, who wrote this speech with me, and who is an expert on women, peace and security. Thank you so much, Susan, for your assistance on this and for your support for this issue.
