        this year, Bill Singleton was recognised by his peers by being awarded life membership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        at the 2008 national surf lifesaving titles held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Life membership of Surf Life Saving Australia is the highest non-bravery accolade available within the organisation. The award recognises Bill’s exceptional contribution of 66 years to surf lifesaving as a successful competitor, official and administrator. He is currently the patron of Surf Life Saving Sydney and until recently was actively involved as a carnival official. He is a well-known, much loved and respected friend to all involved in surf lifesaving throughout Australia and especially in the Sutherland shire.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill entered lifesaving when he joined Bronte
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Club
        </a>
        in 1941. He became a life member in 1957 after long success in both competition and administration. The Bronte club described Bill’s contributions to lifesaving as legendary and said that he epitomises all that is good about surf lifesaving and that many people can attribute their successes in the movement to either words of encouragement from Bill or his efforts in saving lives.

        His move to the Sutherland shire, in the electorate of Cook, saw him join Elouera Surf Life Saving Club in 1969, where he has held the positions of vice-patron, vice-president, senior vice-president and deputy president, served on various committees, held numerous training roles and been actively involved in patrols and rescues. Bill also joined Garie Surf Life Saving Club, in the electorate of Cook, in 1998, where he has held various administrative roles, including club historian. Bill was president of Surf Life Saving Sydney from 1991 to 1995 and vice-president for the 10 years from 1981 to 1991. He was heavily involved on seven different committees as well as being a gear steward and

        supervisor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill has also been heavily involved in Surf Life Saving

         New South Wales
        </a>
        , where he is also a life member. Elouera Surf Life Saving Club described Bill’s commitment to surf lifesaving as ‘total dedication’ and ‘magnificent lifetime service which is both conspicuous and loyal’. On behalf of all my constituents in Cook and in the shire, I wish to congratulate Bill on his many achievements and decades of selfless service. Unfortunately, Bill was recently diagnosed with inoperable cancer. My thoughts and prayers are with Bill and his family at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to acknowledge another Elouera Surf Life Saving Club member, Ted Brooker

        , who was also recently recognised for his contribution to surf lifesaving with the award of a President’s Medal. Although this is a national award, it was presented to Ted at the recent New South Wales state titles at Blacksmiths Beach in Swansea-Belmont. Ted also has a long-term association with surf lifesaving at
