        I take this opportunity this evening to acknowledge the Produce of Heaven campaign that continues in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">

        this week. I acknowledged the team earlier today in the 90-second statements. As part of the new initiative under the Produce of Heaven campaign, 17 north-west Tasmanian agriculture business representatives will travel to Hong Kong—they are on the plane right now—from 14 to 21 August, where they will exhibit their produce at the Hong Kong International Food Expo. After the overwhelming success of the Taiwan exhibition, already creating $500,000 in orders as a starting point, and fantastic interest in our region and the creation of new jobs, we look forward to more success from the Hong Kong International Food Expo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Companies that will be exhibiting their produce include Hellyers Road Distillery, Ghost Rock Winery, Petuna Seafoods, Spreyton Fresh, Richey Fishing, Blue Hills Honey,

        , Kay Beef Farms and Greenham. The five-day visit will be packed with some exciting initiatives for attending delegates and the region. Included in the visit will be a private networking function between Tasmanian north-west delegates and leading businesses in Hong Kong, which follows on from the success of the business matching that occurred in Taiwan. This function is destined to be a spectacular success, with larger than life personality and

        The Produce of Heaven trade stand at the Hong Kong food show will provide a showcase of Tasmania’s north-west produce to over 100,000 buyers and visitors. The occasion will provide an excellent opportunity for the delegates to meet buyers and

        supermarkets and hospitality outlet and hotel leaders. Delegates will meet with businesses for the purpose of discussing trade opportunities, where they will gain valuable export contacts for business with a view to secure contract for supply.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken many times about the wonderful produce that comes from the southern state. Also, from an agricultural perspective, Mr Speaker, at times in this country we do not appreciate the wonderful produce from your area, whether it be from the perspective of fruit, vegetables, meat or even some of the freshest water in the world. The opportunities are outstanding in Asia and we are just starting to tap into that region. This campaign builds on the Fair Dinkum Food campaign, which occurred some two years ago. In Australia we need to acknowledge the value of food produce. Sadly, at times, with the dominance of the two major supermarket chains, that does not seem to be put forward to achieve the acknowledgement that it deserves.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge some of the comments from Taiwan. For example, Richey Fishing said:

        Without the Produce of Heaven, this initiative, we would have been unable to achieve these wonderful outcomes.

        Spreyton Fresh said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The interest shown in our apple juice was very promising and we are hopeful that the contacts we have made will enable us to export juice to Taiwan in the near future. We are very confident that this will occur as we are exporting cherries to Taiwan next season.

        This has been truly an exciting opportunity and one that a small business such as ours would not have had the ability to undertake by ourselves. I am expecting to do great business in Taiwan and this will lead to the full-time employment of at least one person, if not two people, on King Island.

        Tim Hess from Petuna Seafood said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Much interest was found in ocean trout. It was extremely promising, with many potential buyers becoming involved in our network in market.

        food show is one of the largest specialist food exhibitions in Asia. This year, 55 countries and 100,000 visitors are already registered to attend. With Produce of Heaven as the only Australian delegation to exhibit, we expect some wonderful and great outcomes.
