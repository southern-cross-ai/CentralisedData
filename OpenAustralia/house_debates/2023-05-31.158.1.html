        Since I came to this place in 2016, I've been working with my local community to change the story of the life you are expected to live when you've grown up in an outer suburban lower socioeconomic area. Across the country, 41 per cent of Australia's most disadvantaged 0-to-5-year-olds live in the top 20 per cent of the most disadvantaged suburbs. Children from socially and economically disadvantaged areas typically have poorer physical health, less access to learning materials and are less likely to access materials and support that they need. We on this side of the House believe that you're entitled to have a good education and access to good health care no matter the postcode in which you grow up.

        In recent years, there have been pilot programs come and go from our community, in schools and local groups, hosted by state and federal governments, philanthropic organisations and social services. They've each had different
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s, different projects and different theories, but each have come to the same conclusion: the first five years of a child's life are absolutely critical for positive life outcomes. By supporting families in health and education in the early years, you can change the story for children and indeed for their families and the entire community around them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm so proud to be working with my good friend and colleague the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Childhood_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Early Childhood Education

        to change the story for my community now that we're in government. The Early Years Partnership aims to improve the wellbeing and school readiness of children before they turn four. The WA state government, the Minderoo Foundation, the Telethon Kids Institute and our local community, including organisations like the Champion Centre in Armadale, are officially working together now in that partnership, with the support of the federal government through the Connected Beginnings program in Armadale.
       </p>
       <p>
        Connected Beginnings is an Australian government grants program aimed at giving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        children the best start to life. The program specifically draws upon the strengths and knowledge of First Nations communities to increase children's and families' engagement with health and early childhood education and care. The program seeks to enable local communities to identify problems and manage solutions themselves at the community level.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's the same principle as the Voice to Parliament—that listening to communities on the matters that affect them leads to better policies and better outcomes. In achieving a voice to parliament, we will be laying a stronger foundation for a better future for the families in local communities like mine across the country.
