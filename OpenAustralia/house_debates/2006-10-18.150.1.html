       <p>
        I rise this evening to speak about a unique part of Australia in my electorate of Braddon. Covering a vast area of Tasmania’s north-west hinterland, the area known as the Tarkine is regarded as Australia’s largest temperate rainforest and is of significant environmental and heritage value. Through the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement, the Australian government has already acted to protect this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tarkine is one of north-west Tasmania’s greatest natural assets and represents a significant drawcard for future tourism in the region. The area is becoming increasingly well known nationally and internationally, and holds a great, untapped potential. In the not too distant future, I believe people will speak of the Tarkine in the same vein as they now speak of

        and the great

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        If we are to further develop tourism as a strong and viable industry in Tasmania’s north-west then it is important that we manage our natural attractions in a responsible and sustainable manner. The Cradle Coast Authority, which is our regional development body, has been working through an extensive consultation process with the local community and other stakeholders to produce a Tarkine Development Plan. The plan provides an opportunity to develop partnerships between key stakeholders in the region to protect the unique environmental values of the Tarkine whilst also looking at ways of appropriately developing its tourism potential. It is hoped that the Tarkine Development Plan will provide a blueprint for tourism development in this unique area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Howard government has provided the impetus for developing the Tarkine as a tourist attraction. On 8 September 2006 I had the privilege of announcing $200,000 in Australian government funding under the Howard government’s Tourism and Conservation Initiative, to help fast-track the Cradle Coast Authority’s work on the Tarkine Development Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must thank the Minister for Tourism, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Bailey" rel="nofollow">
         Fran Bailey
        </a>
        , who is a regular visitor to my electorate, for her assistance in securing this funding. I would like to acknowledge the Cradle Coast Authority, especially the executive chairman, Roger Jaensch, and the Regional Tourism Development Manager, Ian Waller, for their vision and work on this important project.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was fitting that we were able to secure this grant in time for it to be announced at the 2006 Cradle Coast tourism forum, ‘Capturing the edge’, held at Smithton on 7 and 8 September 2006. This forum was attended by a wide range of stakeholders from throughout the north-west of Tasmania including tourist and associated industries and local councils. Along with the Tarkine Development Plan, a new brand for the region was also unveiled. ‘Tasmania’s north-west—where will the stories take you?’ has been adopted as the slogan for our new tourism marketing strategy. Supported by all nine local councils in the greater north-west and west coast region, and by Tourism Tasmania, the strategy will focus on telling the remarkable cultural and heritage stories of the north-west.
       </p>
       <p>
        I fully support the decision to feature Tasmania’s north-west in the marketing of our region and I note this has been particularly welcomed by local tourist operators. Regrettably, the tourism industry in my electorate has had a few major setbacks over the past year. However, in the true spirit of the people of the north-west, rather than dwell on these setbacks, the industry is looking to move forward in a positive way. The assistance of the Howard government in these endeavours is greatly appreciated by all involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that not only you but all the members of the House will be hearing much more about what Tasmania’s superb north-west, particularly the magnificent Tarkine area, has to offer to visitors in terms of tourism in the future not only from Tasmania, not only from Australia but from overseas.
