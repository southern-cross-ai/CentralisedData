        On Friday 4 December, Austrade will hold an information seminar in my electorate to explain the details of the free trade agreements this government has signed with some of our largest trading partners. Hinkler businesses will find out how they can take advantage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        s in place with China, Japan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        . The interactive session will give Hinkler businesses an opportunity to speak directly to officials from the

        </a>
        , Austrade and other government agencies. I strongly encourage local people involved in advanced manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, food and beverage, and tourism and hospitality to attend. The free seminar will be held between 11 am and 2 pm in the auditorium of

        Queensland East Coast Bundaberg campus on Walker Street. Registration commences at 10.30 am. The event will suit not only those who already export but also those considering expanding export opportunities. The key thing about these agreements for the people in my electorate is that they will lead to jobs that are sorely needed in my region. When businesses have the confidence to expand it is they that create new jobs. We on this side of the House understand that it is business that creates jobs, not government.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is not enough time here today to detail the benefits of each of the agreements we have signed, so I use the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement as an example. Under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, 95 per cent of Australian goods exported will be tariff-free. This includes the abolition of tariffs on our clean, green, premium agricultural products as well as on a range of Australian manufactured goods such as pharmaceutical products, car engines, plastic products and processed food. China is Australia's largest agricultural and fisheries export market, worth $9 billion in 2013-14—$9 billion—up from $5 billion in 2010-11. China's demand for high-quality agricultural and food products is growing rapidly. Until now, the absence of a bilateral FTA with China has meant that Australian producers and exporters have faced significant tariffs on agricultural products, putting them at a competitive disadvantage compared to countries like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and Chile. Examples of progressive tariff eliminations include the elimination of the 10 to 25 per cent tariff on macadamia nuts; the elimination of the 10 to 30 per cent tariff on all non-citrus fruit within four years; elimination of the 10 to 13 per cent tariff on all fresh vegetables within four years; elimination of the 14 per cent tariff on crabs, oysters, scallops and mussels within four years; elimination of the up to eight per cent tariff on prawns within four years; and tariffs of up to 65 per cent on alcoholic beverages and spirits will be eliminated within four years. There will also be progressive elimination of tariffs on fruit juices, canned fruit, biscuits and cakes, honey products, pasta and chocolate. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will also increase two-way investment and reduce import costs. For example, the removal of the five per cent tariff on Chinese manufactured exports is expected to make electronics and whitegoods cheaper for all Australians.

        I hope to see many Hinkler businesses and owners at the seminar. This is our opportunity for agricultural producers and for people in regional Australia. For the businesses and the people I represent, this is their chance. This is a chance for them to expand, to find export markets, to increase their business productivity, to make more money and to employ more Australians—particularly the youth of my region, who desperately need those jobs. I congratulate the government on negotiating such a successful agreement, particularly Minister Andrew Robb, and I thank you for the opportunity.
