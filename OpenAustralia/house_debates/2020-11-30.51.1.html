        The strength of our local schools and community groups is vital for the welfare and success of Australians of all ages and circumstances. For Moncrieff, I'd like to highlight some of the groups and schools I've visited over the last two weeks for the work they do. They're all very deserving of the support they've received from the federal government.

        is improving sun safety for their students with a Local Schools Community Fund grant of $5,000 which they've used to purchase new covered outdoor seating for students to enjoy during breaks. The Southport Soccer Club has upgraded change room facilities thanks to a $5,000 Stronger Communities grant. Last but certainly not least is Surfers Paradise State School, who received a Stronger Communities fund grant of $5,000 for new musical instrumentsâ€”close to my heart.

        All of these groups play a role in making our communities healthy, happy and successful. Well done and keep up the good work! A special thankyou to all of the professionals and volunteers involved for their dedication to the good people of Moncrieff.
