        Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention the wonderful success of the Wangaratta Show, which took place on Friday and Saturday. Despite the rain and despite the problems with the levee bank, people turned out in huge numbers to have a wonderful day at the Wang show. So I particularly want to congratulate the organising committee. To Bernie and Fiona, thank you for your hospitality. I had the absolute pleasure of sitting next to Brian Kensington, who is on the committee. What a magnificent achievement he has had over the many, many years that he has been part of the committee. I thank the Wangaratta Girl Guides for the wonderful work they do, and I particularly thank Zoe Goodger for handling us and waiting on our table and your mother, Stephanie, for the great work that she does. I would like to acknowledge the Dwyer family, and particularly Greta—those eggs! Greta won the first prize for her dozen eggs at the Wangaratta show, and you have to go a long way to do that. And her sister came second in the prize for the novelty cake—great work! I would also like to acknowledge the work of the north-east sustainability team and the Wangaratta group, Rowan O'Hagan and all the people who keep us on track at shows and give their time.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I would particularly like to thank the community of Wangaratta. They have had such a hard time with the floods, we have been surrounded by water and yet they turn out in their numbers and support their community. They get involved with the animals and the rides. Wangaratta is a fantastic community. I am so pleased to be your representative and thank you for your great spirit.
       </p>
