        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister take responsibility for not delivering on his commitment that he would fully vaccinate aged-care and disability-care residents and workers who care for them by Easter and that this has left vulnerable Australians at risk?

         At this point, 99.7 per cent of aged-care facilities around Australia have had a first vaccination and 80.3 per cent of aged-care facilities around Australia have had a second vaccination. That means that 156,436 residents have received a first dose and, of those, 126,046 have received a second dose. The importance of these vaccinations has been shown at Arcare, in Maidstone, where two residents have been infected. Both had been vaccinated, one with a first dose and the other with both doses. At this stage, both residents have been placed in hospital for observation, but not for the symptoms or circumstances that they face. They've been placed there for observation. They've been placed there to ensure that other residents are safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         The figure of 99.7 per cent is the national achievement to date, with the remaining facilities—due to their own particular circumstances, such as gastro or otherwise—to be done in the coming days. It is a massive challenge, and yet it's an extraordinary national achievement, to have seen the in-reach, right across the country, to all of these facilities. We have done that to ensure that we are providing protection across the country. That's our task and that's what we've achieved.
