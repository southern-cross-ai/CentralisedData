        I rise to speak and reflect on this year and to thank everyone for all the support they've given me. As this is the last day before we break for Christmas, I thought it would be appropriate that I take this opportunity to deliver a special Christmas message to my electorate of Aston.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christmas means different things to the various cohorts in our diverse nation. For some it's a time to party and let your hair down after a long year and relax. For others it's a time for a bit of retail therapy and a chance to grab a bargain in the post-Christmas sales. But for many it's a time for great stress and financial hardship as they try to make sure that their kids aren't the ones on their street who miss out. Some people don't celebrate, acknowledge or recognise Christmas at all, or they observe a different religious celebration. That's how it is in our beautiful, diverse country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to say thank you to the constituents of Aston. Thank you so much for your kindness throughout 2023 and for electing me to this wonderful place in April. I truly appreciate it. It was a pleasure to see some of you in person when I was out and about throughout the year, and I hope to see you again soon, in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a great year. However, I am looking forward to spending some time with my family, whom I have not spent much time with over the past few months, it has to be said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the members in this place and senators in the other place for spending time with me and helping me navigate through the halls of this place. It takes a bit of getting used to. I had a lot of learning to do when I was first sworn in, and I am still learning as I go. I would like to thank everyone for their patience and for supporting me in this journey. I am very grateful to be surrounded by such supportive people and staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay many respects to the late Peta Murphy, whom I was just getting to know. She helped me so much. I will miss her very much.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take this time to show appreciation to all my volunteers who have all worked tirelessly and earnestly this year. Thank you for all that you do for me. I couldn't have gotten this far without you. I hope you enjoyed the Christmas party that I hosted in November, and I can't wait to get together again for another fun celebration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to my constituents in Aston: as your federal Labor member and your voice in the federal government, I will work with our community each and every day to get things done, to deliver for you and to hear from you about what matters most.
       </p>
       <p>
        To those who celebrate: have a great Christmas and a fantastic new year, and I will see you are back in next year for another terrific year. Enjoy the holiday season and stay safe.
       </p>
