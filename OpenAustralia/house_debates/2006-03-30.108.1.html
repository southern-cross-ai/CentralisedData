       <p>
        I am pleased to have been able to present certificates to 10 organisations recently under the Australian government’s excellent Community Water Grants program. This program was designed to encourage community groups in schools to undertake programs that will save water. Australia is the driest continent, and it really is important to have this program. While my region of Queensland has experienced very good rainfalls in recent months—and a good proportion of it over the last fortnight as a result of cyclones Larry and Wati—there remains a concern about water shortages across Australia, while much of our nation remains drought affected.

        The 10 projects in my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        electorate will save some 30 million litres of water annually, equivalent to 30 Olympic swimming pools full of water. This is a significant amount, and it is well worth mentioning that once these programs are in place the water savings will be repeated year after year. One of the projects in particular has impressed me. The Montville State School has been awarded $29,836 under the scheme, money which will help to pay for new tanks that will capture and store rainwater from the roofs of school buildings. The water will then be treated, using an ultraviolet facility, and used for drinking water. It is amazing that on the Sunshine Coast this school currently has no reticulated drinking water. Once the project is completed, it is possible that they may well have some of the purest drinking water on the Sunshine Coast. It all comes through the thoughtful plans put in place by the Australian government. The school estimates that it will save somewhere in the vicinity of 75,000 litres annually.

        Altogether, the local organisations will share in funding of almost $421,000. Funds will also go to the following groups: Buderim Wanderers Soccer Club, $49,281 to install tanks to catch rainwater for playing-field irrigation;

        </a>
        , $50,000 for tanks to collect rainwater to supply toilets and irrigate gardens. All of the recipients of these grants are very excited. They are enthusiastic about their grants. This program is very sensible, because it improves environmental outcomes and water conservation throughout the country. I commend this program to the House.
