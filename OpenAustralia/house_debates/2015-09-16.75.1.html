        My question is for the Minister for Education and Training representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister update the House on the benefits to growth and jobs of the export agreement with China. What support has there been for expanding free trade and what are the obstacles to those benefits being realised?

            Western Australia

           , which at this time is facing an election very soon. We want to remind them of the huge benefits in international education, in opening up services and in agriculture from their particular part of the world that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will bring and that the Labor Party is trying to sabotage. Labor is actually trying to sabotage jobs and growth for Western Australians. On Saturday, when voters go to the polls, they need to remember that this side of the House is in favour of jobs and growth, that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will bring, while that side of the House is dancing to the tune, instead, of the

          <p>
           I am asked about the support that we have received for the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The wonderful work done in advocacy by the Minister for Trade and Investment has brought a lot of people out in support of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, especially because of the risk that Labor pose to it and to the economy; groups like the

          <p>
           I picked up a speech recently which I had started to read and I was terribly impressed by some of the things contained in the speech, lines like:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … trade benefits working people.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           …   …   …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Trade is especially important for growth at the moment when the economy faces headwinds.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           …   …   …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Refusing to enter into trade agreements will allow our competitors to gain market share at Australia's expense.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">

           Miners, manufacturing workers, food processing workers, truck drivers, wharfies, warehousing workers, shop assistants—their jobs all depend on exports and imports.

           They sound like the people of south-western Perth in Canning. I thought that this was an excellent speech, that

            Julie Bishop
