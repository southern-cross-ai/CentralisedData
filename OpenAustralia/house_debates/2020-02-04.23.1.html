         As noted in the table in response to Question 1, $200,000 has recently been allocated to the Kangaroo Island Nature Resources Management Board to assist the recovery of threatened species and threatened ecological communities in areas impacted by bushfires on the island. Funding will support emergency intervention activities such as priority pest animal control, which may include feral cat management.

         This funding is part of the Australian Government's initial investment of $50 million to support immediate work to protect wildlife and longer-term protection and restoration efforts. The $50 million funding package comprises:
