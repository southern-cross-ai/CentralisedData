       <p>
        One of the first priorities of this government was to make our workplaces fairer and ensure that Australians were better paid for the work they did. We are now working to ensure that Australians keep more of what they earn, while those opposite want Australians to work longer for less. We understand that family budgets are under pressure right now, and taking that pressure off family budgets is our No. 1 priority. In relation to tax cuts, Robin from Wanniassa wrote to me, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Definitely the right choice for our nation's future. This was true leadership by the Labor party. Thank you and keep up good work like this.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Bean, some 82,000 taxpayers, like Robin, will now be receiving an average tax cut of over $1,800 a year, with 63,000 taxpayers in my electorate now set to get a larger tax cut than under the previous arrangements. Whether you're a teacher, a nurse, a retail worker, a tradie or a public servant, under this Labor government you'll get a tax cut. These tax cuts come on top of billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief that we're rolling out, including energy bill relief, cheaper medicines, Strengthening Medicare, higher income support payments, and the biggest boost to rent assistance in 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the opposition were still playing politics with the tax cuts last night, I'm proud to be part of a government that's delivering real cost-of-living relief to families in my community and right across the country.
