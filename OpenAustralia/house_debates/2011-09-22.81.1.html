        yesterday which will reveal that, on a per person basis, Australia's carbon tax will cost $1,130, while Europe's scheme will cost $290 per head. With a world economy unsettled, our unemployment rate rising and our economic growth forecast being slashed, how can this be the right time to introduce a carbon tax that is more than four times larger than Europe's?

        <p>
         May I remind the shadow Treasurer that there are bipartisan commitments in this country to cut carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. Either the shadow Treasurer is suggesting that the opposition no longer holds that commitment—and I do not hear him suggesting that—or he is suggesting that that remains the commitment of the opposition. If it remains the commitment of the opposition to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, then the questions that need to be answered are: when should we start to do that? And how should we do it?
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the shadow Treasurer: if he is concerned about adjustments in our economy, then it would make sense, wouldn't it, to start soon and that there is not some form of dramatic dislocation in 2018 or 2019 because you have not started until then. You would start soon—that is what we are intending to do—and you would use the most efficient method possible. The shadow Treasurer would be studying his economics, I am sure, to fulfil his role as shadow Treasurer. If he were doing that, he would be well aware that reputable economists here and around the world recommend that the least cost way of cutting carbon pollution is by putting a price on carbon that big polluters pay. That is exactly what we are proposing to do. The shadow Treasurer, I believe, if he brings economic rigour and principles to bear, would have to look with disgust at the opposition's policy, knowing that it will be wasteful, knowing that it will be inefficient, knowing that it will be more costly, knowing that for every tonne of carbon abatement it will cost more and, ultimately, it will add up to a cost for Australian families of $1,300 per year.

          <p>
           On the question of timing of starting to address carbon pollution, I have been addressing that. I presume the shadow Treasurer must stand for starting in 2019 and trying to do it all in 12 months at some hideous cost per tonne of abatement rather than having our economy adjust over time, using the most efficient mechanism possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           I presume in his question the shadow Treasurer was referring to some advertisements and comparisons that were done by the Australian Trade and Industry Alliance about the Australian scheme and the European scheme. As the Secretary of the Department of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">

           made clear yesterday, those advertisements compare an overinflated number for Australian permits with only auction revenue from the introductory phase of the

            <p>
             I thank the member for his question. It is very important that Australia maintains its open, competitive economy. It is those reforms that were initiated by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
              Bob Hawke
             </a>
             and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
              Paul Keating
             </a>
             and carried forward in places by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
              John Howard
             </a>
             that have laid the foundations for 20 years of recession-free economic growth. It is true that there is a sense of rising protectionist sentiment around the world, and that itself is a threat to the completion of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Round" rel="nofollow">
              Doha Round
             </a>
             of multilateral trade negotiations. Those protectionist sentiments are not being expressed just overseas; they are being expressed here in Australia, both outside and inside the parliament. We have seen that expressed through a bill that would have prohibited the importation of apples from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             . We have seen it expressed through a private member's bill that would have required the labelling of palm oil in a way that is inconsistent with Australia's
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
              World Trade Organisation
             </a>
             obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have seen proposals in relation to dumping measures, and I commend the customs minister for a very comprehensive and sensible
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
              WTO
             </a>
             -consistent set of measures to deal with dumping, but there is in fact a dissenting or minority report from the Senate which basically says that we should be looking at a reversal of the onus of proof in relation to anti-dumping—that is, you are dumping unless you can prove otherwise. We have had expressed in this parliament the view that that particular measure is a sensible measure and it should be taken seriously and we should proceed with that.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is notwithstanding the advice of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
             </a>
             , which says the amendments would result in a breach of Australia's international obligations. This is the problem: we have proposals in this parliament for measures that would breach our international trading obligations. Why is that important? Because we rely on the World Trade Organisation to have a set of rules to protect our Australian businesses from unfair practices by others. That is why we have a set of world trading rules, but if we do not play by those rules, if we do not comply with them, we open ourselves up to retaliation. We have had in this parliament, expressed in relation to international carbon-linking, statements about Iran, Venezuela, Syria and Yemen. Those have not come from this side of the parliament but from the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
             It reminds me, with this sense of economic Hansonism that is going on, of a statement that was actually made not by a coalition member but by a Labor member, a predecessor of the member for Canberra, who once said that traditionally most of Australia's imports come from overseas. I think that is true, that traditionally they have, but the opposition is on to it now and it has realised that in order to engage in international trade we must engage with foreigners—these rascally, pesky foreigners. The opposition leader is saying he is not against international trade, just so long as it is not with foreigners. The only foreigners that the opposition leader likes are the people smugglers, to whom he is saying, 'Start your engines; come on down!'

                      <p>
                       Continuing on from what I was saying before, it seems I am, yet again, a minority of one in this place insofar as I have a policy of: stay on the boats. If people choose to be self-smugglers then I do not think the government of Australia should assist them in that. I repeat, as I said before: if the government and the opposition persist in their policies, then people, like the people from my own electorate—the Sikhs from the Punjab in India—would be taking to the boats, and I think it would probably be a good idea for them to take to the boats as far, as I can see. It appears to me that 70 per cent of the people that get on a boat—we are receiving all sorts of figures and they are all different, ranging from 64 per cent up to 94 per cent of the people—end up in Australia. So we are not sure which set of figures to believe, but clearly the vast majority of the people who get on the boats end up as Australian citizens. One group of people who have proved themselves to be wonderful Australians is the Sikhs. They are very patriotic instant Australians who fit in immediately and are extremely popular. If you look at any of the demonstrations that I am associated with in
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                        North Queensland
                       </a>
                       , you will see that among the people at the front are the people in the turbans, because people like them, and if the Sikhs are going along with the demonstration then it is a good thing to be part of. If we were going to take in people who come in on the boats, then I would think it would be highly preferable that people such as the Sikhs should be taken in. But this country does not have the wherewithal to take an unlimited number of people who walk in off the street any time they like. If you lead these people to believe that Australia can do that, you will do so at the expense of social welfare in this nation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We had 15 meetings—which were just for our supporters, actually—in the year before the last election in 15 different towns, and in every one of those towns people raised the issue of electricity charges, which they could not afford to pay. It seems to me that, whatever solution we choose in order to deal with the question of people arriving on boats, we are still going to end up with thousands of people coming into the country every year. Other governments stop people from coming to their country, and clearly we should be doing something to stop people from coming to our country. Endeavours to do this have been made on both sides of the House, but they have fallen well short of proper and responsible government. If you want people to come into the country, I would say that you should by all means expand your immigration intake—I have always been very pro-migration—and I would plead with whoever is the government of Australia to look with sympathy upon the claims of people who will blend harmoniously with the greater Australian population. Once again I use the example of the Sikhs, from whom I get numerous and continuous requests, all of which I have enthusiastically supported, to come to Australia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The issue of people arriving on boats is very difficult and complex, and I think that people on both sides of the House have worked extremely hard to come up with acceptable solutions to it. In fairness to the government's position, I must say that if a person is contemplating coming to Australia, and they know that 70 per cent—I will choose that figure—of people arriving on boats are going to get into Australia, then it is a pretty fair bet that they will get in too.
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
                        If I
                       </a>
                       were a betting man, I would say, 'That's not a bad bet—you've got a 3 to 1 chance of getting into the country.' If you are a husband, a wife and three kids and you are on social welfare, you will get pretty close to $80,000 a year, believe it or not, including rent subsidies and various other benefits. That is a pretty good deal, as far as I can see; you would be a mug not to have a go at it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       But the statistics are very deceitful, because we have been told—and I do not know whether this is correct; I am very suspicious of all the figures I am getting—that some 500 people have died trying to get into this country. It would be good if the government could get that message—'There's also a chance that you may not get here; you're going in very second-rate ships, and some of them are simply shipwrecked or sink, and some of you will die in your endeavours to get here'—out to the people who are intending to come to this country. It would also be good to get the message out that, if these people go to Malaysia, they will not be at the front of the queue but in a very, very big queue and that they will have to stand in line with 100,000 Burmese who are coming to this country.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So there is some definite appeal in what the government is putting forward here. It would seem to me that if you get to Nauru you are also in a queue, but you are at the front of the queue. The government's arguments would seem to me to be very cogent, but I find myself in a situation where neither of the options appeals to me even remotely. So I will stay, it would appear, as a minority of one in this place. Once again I make the point that if—

                        gestured across the House to ask whether in my heart I could support this amendment to the Migration Act—whether someone who is associated with human rights and has a close association with many migrant and refugee communities in this country could endorse it. Later in the week, my convictions were questioned by the member for Mitchell. He has nothing better to do with his time than to rush to his local paper boasting about how he has been thrown out of the House and that he had said as he departed: 'I remember when Laurie was a lefty'. These people are stereotyping this debate and making it extremely simplistic.

                       <p>
                        It is no surprise that today they were joined in their analysis of this debate by the member for Melbourne. As we know from listening to a previous speaker, in a recent radio program, Senator Bob Brown, the leader of the Greens, who does not believe in any offshore processing—and, of course, he is joined by Senator Hanson-Young and the member for Melbourne in that belief—indicated that the eventual outcome of this debate would be that offshore processing would be destroyed. Today, we are going down that road for certain.

                       <p>
                        The contribution of the member for Melbourne to this debate today was as infamous as his misunderstanding earlier this week of the history of the Vietnamese who entered this country. He said that they had all come by boat; he had no knowledge of the processing wait in

                        </a>
                        and no knowledge of the situation of the Vietnamese in camps in the Philippines, which can be seen in the film

                        . Furthermore, he made the extremely erroneous allegation that Labor was advertising to the Australian people that it was sending people to be caned in Malaysia. He went on to say that poll after poll in this country has endorsed onshore processing. One poll, a recent Fairfax poll, has endorsed that position. The question has been rarely asked of the Australian people. Surveys from May 2009 to July 2010 from Morgan, Galaxy, Age/Nielsen and Essential Report showed that over 60 per cent of Australians said that they supported a tougher policy in this area. In one of those polls they actually asked about offshore processing, and 62 per cent of people said that they endorsed a stronger policy on offshore processing.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I refer the member for Melbourne to the work by Professor Goot,
                        <i>
                         Population, immigration and asylum seekers: patterns in Australian public opinion 2011
                        </i>
                        . He may get some worthwhile knowledge by reading that publication. There is nothing right necessarily about Australian public opinion. Basically, you should only utilise it when you feel it is right. But he has come here today and said that the Australian people want onshore processing. That is totally incorrect and he knows it. He has described this as a grubby debate and a race to the bottom. As with those Liberal members, he is making this very simplistic. There is nothing wrong with offshore processing, even if you support a strong humanitarian refugee migration intake. There is nothing wrong with endorsing offshore processing, if you are concerned about people being in the camps for two decades and are concerned about the people who live near the camps.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Essentially, there is a real moral question here and people can take different positions on it and understand it in different fashions. I strongly endorse offshore processing, and I do not think you are going to see too much inconsistency from me on this matter. At the same time, I do believe that the number of boats arriving has a relationship with events in other countries. It is not just about what Australia does. It is not just about how available the boats or the smugglers are. We do not exactly get refugee claimants on boats from all lands on this earth. At the moment we are getting the Tamils from

                        The opposition is now coming forward, at a very late stage in this long debate, saying that the be-all and end-all is whether people have signed up to the international convention and that Nauru is justified because it has signed up and others have not. Earlier today I heard the member for Goldstein quoting
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House" rel="nofollow">
                         Freedom House
                        </a>
                        about the situation in Malaysia compared to Nauru. We all know that Nauru is not a long-term option. I spoke to a person this week who is very involved in refugee policy who has recently been there. I heard that part of the camp is currently being used for schoolchildren. There are water shortages. The water is cut off for a few hours every day. There is no work available on the island for the people if they are let out. The situation is chronic indeed. What are they going to do when 1,500 people are there?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Those opposite are talking about what a failure this has been because all the boats have come. If they did not think the boats were going to come—under either side in government—why did they spend $317 million of taxpayers' money on

                         Christmas Island
                        </a>
                        ? If they had solved the problem, if boats were never going to come again, why did they build that facility? They built that facility because they knew there was always going to be a challenge to Australian immigration policy and the right of the government of the day to have some say in our refugee and humanitarian program and where refugees come from. When the laws were changed with respect to temporary protection visas—the new nirvana; the new glorious solution—those opposite stood there like stunned mullets and let the legislation go through. Dr Stone, the member for Murray, said at the time that it had outlived its purpose. And now, today, it is Nauru or nothing.

                        The member for Goldstein quoted Freedom House on the situation in Malaysia. Freedom House said that Malaysia got eight out of a possible 14 with respect to human rights—14 is the worst case; it got eight. Those opposite say that everyone has to sign the convention, and it is very interesting to look at the other countries that have signed the refugee convention. Those opposite say that we cannot send them to Malaysia. Malaysia have a court system. When

                        was basically set up by the government, he could fight his way through the legal system. They have a democratic political system. They have recently legislated with regard to getting work rights for refugees in the country. They have got rid of their internal security legislation.

                        It is interesting to see who has else has signed the refugee convention—and we can send them there, those opposite reckon. Afghanistan got 12 out of 14, China got 13 out of 14, the

                        </a>
                        of the Congo got 12 out of 14, Iran got 12 out of 14 and Zimbabwe got 12 out of 14—and we ceaselessly hear opposition members, particularly those from

                        </a>
                        , telling us how bad Zimbabwe is. These countries which have signed the convention—which is the one thing those opposite think a country needs to have done for us to send people there—are the countries which we receive many of our refugees from. And those opposite are saying that those countries are good enough to send people to.

                        There has also been the statement that they can tow people back to Indonesia. The shadow minister's nice bit of language about this was: 'Oh, we can't send them to Malaysia because it has not signed the convention, but we can tow them back to Indonesia'—which is in a similar class. While supportive of reforms and change in Indonesia, I do not think there are many people here today who would say that Indonesia is that much more democratic, liberal or tolerant than Malaysia.

                          And, as was indicated, we have no agreement with them. Nauru is a recipe for failure. Those opposite say that we have had so many boats and so many claimants since we suggested Malaysia. They know very well that in the same sort of period, after they suggested Nauru, the boats kept coming. The numbers in that lead-up period—a very similar time frame—were very strong.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Those opposite can argue that a lot of the people from Nauru eventually went to

                           New Zealand
                          </a>
                          and they did not all come to Australia. The fact of life is that the overwhelming majority went to New Zealand or Australia, and anyone who follows immigration knows that New Zealand is often the first step to migration to Australia. That is why Australia had some concerns a decade ago with regard to the huge number of Fijian-Indian claimants that New Zealand was taking because, in a very short time, they would be coming here afterwards. So the policy that supposedly stopped the boats led to most of these people eventually coming to Australia—the overwhelming majority of them. The cost of this has been assessed as $1 billion—$1 billion of taxpayers' money will be needed for this useless, senseless alternative with respect to Nauru. The situation is the same with regard to

                          s. Most of these people eventually came here, but it was after individual human suffering.

                          It is right, member for Sturt. The overwhelming majority of them came here, but they were separated from their families for years on end. Basically, there was no effective retardation of the eventual success of their cases.

                          We do need offshore processing because, quite frankly, onshore processing is a recipe for people to have decades-long cases against the Australian legal system. In the last fortnight, a person walked into my office—admittedly, he had arrived by plane, but it is the same picture as when people get so much access to our system—who had been fighting the Australian legal system for two decades from a baseless case. I heard from a Hazara last Friday on a rejected spouse case. He had come by boat and he is now complaining that there are so many Hazaras coming by boat with fraudulent claims. This is the kind of situation we have. We do need to have a deterrent to dissuade people from paying people smugglers and to dissuade people from believing that they will be successful if they arrive.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          People cite to me the huge approval rate of people who arrive by boat. I say that they are inflated figures. I say that the 90 per cent pass rate—and recently it was a 70 per cent rate—does not necessarily indicate the bona fides of cases. The reason the pass rate is so high is that many of these people cannot be sent back to their homeland, even when they are rejected. Even where we have agreements with countries, we return very few under Labor or Liberal governments. We find it difficult to disprove their cases because they either do not have identification or they destroyed it on the way here. The contrast for the people in the camps is that they are in situ. We can seriously look at their claims on the spot. We can investigate them more thoroughly.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I very strongly endorse the government's proposals that we must in some manner give people in the camps and those living nearby a bit of room in this intake. We cannot have the intake totally dominated by those who come by boats and planes. We have to ensure that the government of the day has some say and can respond to the

If the arrivals are totally dominated by boats and planes, then the government of the day, Labor or Liberal, can have no say when it is said that we should react to the labour situation in Burma or we should have something to say with regard to Bosnia; we should respond and support what the

                          People criticise Malaysia. In recent times we have seen them get rid of the emergency situation and we have seen them agree to work rights. Perhaps work rights are of no interest to the opposition. I noted the comments of their then spokesperson in the report

                          Today, we see the alliance between the Greens, the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition—a desperate attempt to make sure that the government cannot operate the Malaysian scheme, which they are very fearful will succeed. They are very fearful that the number of boats will be reduced, that the rhetoric about the process being out of control will diminish and that the ammunition will disappear.

                          Quite frankly, the situation is that it is important in this country that the Australian people, who are fair but not stupid, can have confidence in the government of the day that is operating the system, and that the department of immigration is determining who are the humanitarian refugees. Every day of the week in Europe we are seeing growth in the

I would hope that the House acknowledges the responsibility of dealing with it, no matter how long it takes this evening. I do not support the Labor Party or the Liberal Party or the National Party or the Greens on this issue in the way it has been framed to date. I do support and strongly back a nine-year regional cooperative process, started by

If we place an emphasis on that and codify that, we will start to clean up bad law domestically, which I think was reflected on and interpreted by the High Court ruling last month. I think it is the roadmap and the process for the future in starting to, in the long term, clean up bad law regionally.

                             I understand, but I will explain these. It is important. This is new for many members of the House. As to the reason why this legislation in its current form fits within the future direction and the regional cooperation framework, I will be looking to insert:

                             This has been a poor debate framed on the division of onshore versus offshore, of Malaysia versus Nauru, of Labor versus Liberal, of deterrents versus humanitarian issues and of the perception of many that we are being invaded by our neighbours versus those who are wanting to cooperate with our neighbours. Unfortunately, I think this House has been choosing a path of fear for fear's sake, of division for division's sake and of politics for politics' sake. In my view, it has been to date a fake disagreement when we already have a genuine process of real agreement that has been led by various immigration ministers since 2002. I am not sure whether this is about responding to dynamic slogans such as 'Stop the boats' or 'We decide who comes here and on what terms they come' but, even if that is the case, I hope we keep our eyes on working with our regional neighbours through the cooperative framework, a process that is working and delivering and that involves at least 33 countries. There are 43 countries engaged in this process, but at the most recent meeting there were 33, including Nauru and Malaysia. It is not an either/or debate that is being presented in this chamber and to the Australian people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I urge people, using Google or any other means, to type in the words 'Bali process' and to have a look at the most recent document, the Fourth Bali Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. I think it outlines a good policy direction for Australia. It is the road map for the future. I think, therefore, we should work on codifying it in law. In reading through the High Court six-to-one decision, I could not see any reference to the Bali process. I think it is a reflection missed by the six learned judges. In response to that, I think there is a need for this parliament to codify these agreements in law and, from that, to start a process of cleaning up domestic, regional and international law and working on a cooperative framework. The clean-up on domestic law is in and around some legislation from 2001—the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act and the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act—that looks to be in conflict with what regional agreement was trying to achieve at the most recent meeting of the 33 countries, including Nauru, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and all who met as part of that nine-year process. I think there is a need to clean up some domestic laws. Hopefully, if we can codify this agreement as a road map forward, it can flow on the back of that agreement by the parliament. Our request to the executive is to focus on this document.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Likewise, rather than the slogan of 'Stopping the boats'—and I understand it and certainly acknowledge that it is an aspirational goal for all of us—I hope that, regionally, we can think about reframing this process and working on lifting the boats. We need to lift whatever the 43 countries involved in this agreement need, in a cooperative manner, to reach a humanitarian status that allows us to work on law enforcement and border security together. We need to do what we can with both genuine refugees and the not-so-genuine movement of people throughout the region, both in transit and at the source. It is through regional cooperation and regional agreement that we are going to deal with this issue, not through domestic politics and division and disagreement for partisan gain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As I said before, I urge all members of this House to have a good read of those general principles from the most recent meeting on the Bali process and to reflect on their positions. Hopefully, as part of stopping the boats we can also stop the games that have been going on in this political debate. Those amendments will be moved shortly and I would hope to get as much support in this House as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The only other point I would like to make, which I hope all of us reflect on, is that words and language matter. It is incredibly disappointing to listen to the debate and hear the way we make many parts of this very complex issue faceless in the way the law is written and language is used. Language is important in both our public and our private lives. It can shape the way we think about people and problems. All of us should think about the word 'processing', for example, when talking about asylum seekers and those genuinely seeking refugee status. This word, in my view, dehumanises these people. They are not products on a factory line. They are people who are seeking to have their claims for refugee status assessed by our country. I ask the House and the Australian community to think about replacing the word 'processing' with the word 'assessing' or some other more respectful word for what actually is going on in what is a complex area of public policy. I know it is a small step but it is an important one, in my view, in bringing some humanity back to this difficult issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As well, I hope we reflect on some other language in migration law. Terms such as 'offshore entry persons' completely dehumanise what is going on, remove the faces and allow us all to be emotionless about this very complex issue. With that in mind, I know the Commonwealth Ombudsman is on a plain English campaign. I will be writing to the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ask him to think about choosing the Migration Act as a starting point for that plain English campaign. Hopefully, he will take up that offer and we can start to put some respect and values back into the way we write law and the way we deal with all people in and around Australia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I look forward to the support of the House in the regional framework. It has at various times in the last nine years had the very strong support of both political parties. It will be an interesting test of whether we are seeking good public policy or just some partisan politics. I hope it is supported for the long-term interests of better public policy. The regional solution, in my view, is the real solution. I urge the House to consider the amendments.

                              I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill. Ours is a great country. It is a welcoming country, a warm-hearted country, but most significantly it is a country that has been built upon mass immigration. We are very fortunate to have one of the most successful and cohesive multicultural societies that the world has ever witnessed.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              There is a number of important elements that have underpinned that very successful and cohesive multicultural society. I believe there are three elements that have underpinned the success of our society as a multicultural nation. Firstly, we are a generous people, but the control of people movements into our country has always been considered an important question of national sovereignty. Secondly, the power to do this, to exercise this control, has always been considered to be the prerogative of the government—the executive government. Thirdly, the exercise of such control has always been one of the most essential and the key ingredients of the very vibrant, non-discriminatory multicultural policy that we have. These not only are elements that are underpinning that which we as Australians hold dear but also are Labor values. That is why

                              but resisted boat arrivals from Cambodia. That is why the Keating government could champion multiculturalism like no other government before it but, at the same time, introduce mandatory detention.

                             <p>
                              The question of control has been an important and an ongoing part of our immigration program. It is important because we believe that sovereignty is a key issue and that the very success of our multiculturalism relies upon us maintaining that control. When I look at the bill that is before the House I see that is very much consistent with these principles. Most significantly, it is about restoring the notion that control in these matters is within the hands of executive government. It should be the prerogative of executive government to determine the policies that are put in place in order to achieve that control and to maintain an orderly migration program. We all know that the High Court has taken a decision that overturned the position as we previously understood it. The opportunity now rests with this parliament to amend the law and to restore the position to that which was previously understood.

                              Much has been said in this debate from a number of members in their contributions about approaches that have been put in place in the past. There has been considerable attention to the efforts to manage the flow of people throughout the post-

                              period. The flow of Indochinese people throughout our region and, indeed, in many cases to our shores was often held up as a great example of how these matters should be resolved. I think in some of this discussion people often misread or misrepresent what actually did occur back then. It is worth noting that at that time there were a number of boat arrivals to Australia. At that time people were accepted, processed and determined to be refugees. In total there were about 2,000 who came directly to Australia's shores by boat.

                                An important part in dealing with that challenge was that countries like Australia were involved in international efforts to resettle people who were displaced as a result of the

                                and the regime that was installed as part of that war. If we have a look back into history, we see that at that time the Comprehensive Plan of Action was entered into and under that program Australia welcomed 16,800 refugees over a period of years. They were refugees that were accepted through an offshore program. They were not people who arrived by boat. They were people that this country, as part of meeting its international obligations and pulling its weight internationally, determined should be given an opportunity to start a life in Australia. I think that was an appropriate policy. It was appropriate because the Australian executive government was able to take the necessary steps in order to enact that program. That is the question that is up for debate in this bill: whether or not executive government should continue to have the ability to take decisions to control people movements into our country.

                                Significantly, in the context of the Vietnamese boat arrivals debate people often overlook the fact that thousands of Vietnamese people died on the high seas in the course of trying to make their way to countries like Australia. Estimates vary greatly but

                                The challenges that we face on the high seas and at our borders today are very different. In some respects it is easier for people to make it to the shore. It is easier for people to make it to Australia. There have been various technological developments that make it easier for people to sail even leaky boats and to get closer to Australia Even if they do not make the mainland because of our increased capacity to patrol our waters, there is a greater chance for people to make it by boat to Australia. In part that has led to an increase in the numbers of people that have been seeking to make it to Australia by boat.

                                I mentioned the Indochinese example of the 70s and 80s because I think the Malaysian arrangement that has been brought forward and put in place with the agreement of the Australian government and the Malaysian government is very similar in many respects. The fact that we are prepared to embrace and welcome an extra 1,000 refugees into our country each year but in doing so insist upon the ability to exercise some control over the flow of people in our region, indicates to me that this proposal is very much in keeping with the history and tradition of the way in which this country and the Labor Party have been able to manage people flows in the past.

                               <p>
                                The Malaysian arrangement has a number of key elements that protect the human rights of those that will be relocated to Malaysia to be processed there. I think it is important to acknowledge that. I know the debate that has occurred in this place around this bill has centred largely on whether or not there are sufficient protections put in place to protect the humanitarian interests of those that might be sent back to Malaysia. I also want to introduce into this debate the humanitarian interests of those that might be waiting in refugee camps in Malaysia already or those that might be waiting in refugee camps in other parts of the world.

                                I want to introduce into the debate the story of a Sudanese person in my electorate who has consistently approached me about the difficulties that they have been having to have a family member resettled from a refugee camp in Egypt—a person who has already been determined to be a refugee but has not yet been resettled. This has gone on for several years. I want also, on a more positive note, to reflect upon a Bhutanese refugee who, as a result of the decision of this government just a few years ago to increase our intake of refugees from Bhutan and from camps in Nepal, came to Australia. That person resides in Western Sydney as part of a growing Bhutanese community in the

Importantly, in the latter case, I make the point that they arrived in Australia because Australia, through the exercise of control over its migration programs, has ensured that they have been given that opportunity. I think that these elements are important to preserve as part of the approach that we bring.

                                The principal criticism that has been raised about the arrangement with Malaysia is that it is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention. I will make a few observations on this point. Those making these criticisms were all too happy to send asylum seekers to Nauru when it had not been a signatory to the convention. They were all too happy to turn boats around on the high seas and not only risk the lives of Australian defence personnel and border protection personnel but also risk the lives of those asylum seekers—by turning them around and taking them back to Indonesia which, like Malaysia, is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                They are the same people who have suggested a range of other alternatives, which include sending some people back to Pakistan to process them. Pakistan is not a signatory to the UN convention. I make the point that being a signatory to the UN convention is not in itself a guarantee of human rights' protection. If we look at the list of countries that are signatories to the UN convention, we see ones that do not always have the best record on human rights. They are countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, the

                                of Congo, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Iran and Somalia. But what is even more instructive is the list of countries—in particular, those in our region—that are not signatories to the refugee convention. It includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">

                                and India. Many of these countries are source countries or transit countries for people flows in our region.

                               <p>
                                I think it is odd in the extreme to take the view that we would not be prepared to undertake offshore processing in those countries that are at the very heart of people movement challenges in our region. I understand the opposition has a policy on Nauru. I think the arguments have been very strongly made about the cost of Nauru and that people realise people smugglers are telling prospective customers of theirs, 'If you go to Nauru it will only be a short time before you end up in a country like Australia.' For these reasons I do not think Nauru will work in the way that some suggest.

                               <p>
                                Regardless of whether you support Nauru or support offshore processing in any other part of our region, to tell the executive government that they do not have the capacity to enter into an arrangement and process asylum seekers offshore in countries that are not signatories to the UN convention is to handcuff the executive government—not just the executive government of today but the executive government of the future. It means the government is not able to enter into reasonable or meaningful agreements with key nations within our region. You cannot have a regional solution if you take the position that only those that are signatories to the UN convention can be a part of it.

                                an opportunity to lift the standards available to those who are in camps like the Malaysian ones. A statement made on 25 July 2011 by the UNHCR on our Malaysian arrangement, says:

                                UNHCR hopes that the Arrangement will in time deliver protection dividends in both countries and the broader region.

The potential to work towards safe and humane options for people other than to use dangerous sea journeys are also positive features of this Arrangement. In addition, the

                                This is an opportunity to work with countries that are shouldering a very large part of the burden of people movements in our region. It is an opportunity for us to regain control of people movements in our region and into our country but to do it in a humane way and in a way that ensures we increase our refugee intake and deliver a strong program and a fairer opportunity for people to come to and contribute in Australia.

                                 I am pleased to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is an important piece of legislation for a number of reasons. The government's proposed changes to the Migration Act fail to provide the protections previously provided under the coalition's legislation and fail to properly quarantine ministerial discretion from being open to judicial interpretation. More importantly, rather than seek to uphold the protections that have been a feature of the Migration Act for over a decade now, this amendment bill gives people smugglers back their business model.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Under my colleague, then minister, and member for Berowra, the coalition established section 198A of the Migration Act to enable offshore entry persons to be processed in another country. Under that section the minister could make this declaration provided it had some essential safeguards in place. Those safeguards were very important. They were: access to effective procedures for assessing a person's need for protection; protection for persons pending determination of their refugee status; and protection to persons given refugee status while they awaited return to their own country or were resettled in another country. I hear the hypocrisy of those who speak on the other side about a humane way of doing things. It also made sure the standard of human rights was protected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 The government's response to the High Court decision has been to abolish these protections in this bill, to allow the minister to make a determination without any such protection. To support this bill in its current form the coalition would need to walk away from a decade of policy that has supported such protections contained in the act. We will not do that. Unlike this government, our policy has always been consistent and transparent. Our policy was proven to work and our policy had the experience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 This amendment highlights yet again a government failure. It flips, it flops, and it shows its inconsistency all over the place. More deeply, it goes to the heart of everything that is wrong with this government. It is not consistent, it does not have the courage of its conviction, in this area of migration policy it flops and changes its policy every second week and, deeper than that, it cannot be trusted to manage the borders of this country.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 How do we know this? We know this policy does not work. It has not worked so far. We have had 241 boats turn up with over 12,000 people. So who do the Australian people trust to manage these borders? This government has had a consistent failure on record of boat arrivals. The government has embraced policy failure after policy failure and the government is now, again, coming to us, the opposition, and asking for a blank cheque for another policy that will be a failure. It wants to implement its already failed Malaysian proposal, which has led to 1,000 people turning up since it was announced. That is more than half the 800-person quota since the agreement was signed. We had a bizarre situation in parliament yesterday when the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said to the shadow minister, the member for Cook, 'Well, if you don't think it's going to work why don't you vote for it anyway?' Have you heard of anything more absurd, more illogical and more stupid?

                                <p>
                                 This government might be used to voting for very bad policy, but the coalition are not, and we are not going to vote for bad policy.

                                   Many members of the House might be unaware of the historical significance of the Aboriginal figure Pemulwuy. Pemulwuy was born in 1750 and he was executed in 1802 by the government of the colony of

He was of the Eora tribe, and he was quite determined at that time that, rather than simply acquiesce to the colonisation of Sydney, he would make a stand on behalf of his people. He fought pitched battles against the British and he was extraordinarily successful. He invested the Governor's residence at Parramatta and invested it successfully. He broke the law, of course, that had been created in the time by the

We have moved on from those debates about invasion, Mabo and native title. I do not wish to debate those matters tonight. What I wish to say tonight is that it would be a very gracious act on the part of the British government to instruct the British Natural History Museum to return Pemulwuy's skull to where it belongs, Australia.

He wrote a very good book about Pemulwuy, and in doing so he put on the map a story that otherwise might not have been told. Eric Willmot still campaigns to bring Pemulwuy's skull home to Australia, and he has been joined by Alexander Hartman, who might be well known to many people in this place because he was one of the very first people appointed to the board of headspace. I appointed him to the board of headspace when I started headspace—the youth mental health initiative—in the Howard government.

I know that Prince William will work with Mr Hartman and Mr Willmot to ensure these remains are returned to Australia, where they belong. I think it would be an act that would be very much welcomed by Aboriginal people. I also note that Michael Mundine was one of the very first people that Prince William made this pledge to, and I know that Mr Hartman has been meeting this week with representatives of the British Natural History Museum. He has been assisted ably by our high commission in London, and I wish him the very best of luck with this quest.

                                    I thank the House. Tonight I want to speak about the performance of the opposition throughout this current sitting week. I would like to talk about the performance of the opposition over the last year or more, but, of course, in this short debate I do not have the time. In any case, the antics of the opposition throughout last year and the antics of the opposition throughout this week have been very similar.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    Filibustering has been practised in this place for many years—indeed, decades; in fact, it goes back to Federation and the very origins of this parliament—but this week, it has to be said, the opposition have taken filibustering to dizzying heights. We would not mind that so much if they seemed to have a coherent strategy. Of course, this week we have seen no coherent strategy from the opposition whatsoever. They want to debate the carbon bills but they do not want to debate the carbon bills. They want to debate the clean energy bills but they do not want to debate the clean energy bills. In fact, it got so bizarre last night that they spent 90 minutes talking to each other, having a debate amongst themselves on that side, to argue against a motion from the Leader of the House to extend the debate on the carbon bills.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    They cannot have it both ways. They cannot claim that the government is rushing through the carbon bills without giving them due consultation and consideration and argue for longer speaking opportunities, and then come in here and have a 90-minute argument with themselves to negate what was a very reasonable proposition from the Leader of the House. In fact, the proposition from the Leader of the House was designed to give every member in this place, including the member for Wentworth, an opportunity to speak on the clean energy legislation, one of the most important economic reforms we have seen in a decade. But what do they do? They take the wrecking ball out again and simply say no, no, no.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    I am glad the member for Cook is in the chamber, because yesterday he was saying: 'They have to bring the migration amendment bills on for debate and for a vote. They must bring them on for debate tomorrow, because this is so important to the Australian nation.' When we announced that we were bringing them on for debate, he suddenly changed his tune. 'They are driven by guilt,' he told ABC radio, I think it was. Throughout the course of the day we saw the panic and mayhem that has been so obvious in the ranks of the coalition since the government decided to offer that debate up to the parliament throughout the course of today and beyond as necessary.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    The Australian people are starting to see through this. The tactics are becoming fairly obvious. When people like the member for Berowra and the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, start attacking the Labor Party from the left on the question of migration policy, people start wondering what is going on out there. When they see members of this place who sit on that side talking to themselves for 90 minutes to negate a motion to give members greater opportunity to speak on the clean energy bills, they start to work out that something funny is going on. When they see the Leader of the Opposition almost on a daily basis change his position on these issues, the Australian public start to work out something funny is going on.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    In this new paradigm, we are all learning, we are all doing things differently and we are trying to accommodate all the processes which we now face. It would be very wise and, I think, more productive for the Leader of the Opposition to cooperate just a little—forget about the no, no, no, forget about the filibustering and forget about the constant shift in policy position on a daily basis, which is undoubtedly either driven by polling or driven by his political instinct.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    This side of the House stands ready to complete the debate on the clean energy bills, to pass the clean energy bills, to have a debate on the migration amendments, to pass the legislation on the migration amendment and to get this parliament running and functioning in an orderly manner. Mr Abbott, forget about the no, no, no.

                                     In parliament this week a new and important campaign was launched to challenge Australian governments to address housing affordability. Australians for

                                     </a>
                                     is a coalition of national housing, welfare and community sector organisations. They say housing affordability is the single biggest cost-of-living issue facing Australians.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I know that in my electorate of Melbourne people are under enormous housing stress. Rent hikes, a shortage of housing, mortgage stress and a market that locks out first home buyers all contribute to the problem. Housing costs are both the biggest item in household budgets and the fastest increasing cost, rising by 55 per cent over the last six years and causing enormous housing stress. In the last 10 years house prices have risen by 147 per cent while incomes have risen by only 57 per cent. In the last five years rents have risen at twice the rate of inflation. From the 1960s to the 1990s median home prices in Australia were between three and four times the average annual income. Since then they have gone through the roof to between seven and eight times average incomes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The high cost of housing puts enormous pressure on other areas of essential spending, such as food, health care, transport, education and health. According to the housing coalition, households across the country are paying more than they can afford for housing, with over 740,000 renters and more than 380,000 mortgaged homeowners reporting significant financial stress.

                                     The housing market is also locking out young people from buying homes, with home ownership amongst 25- to 44-year-olds declining by 15 per cent in the last 20 years. It is also particularly bad for students in my electorate who struggle to live close to their university or

                                     . During the election campaign, I met someone living in an unremarkable three-bedroom brick house in Collingwood, paying $190 a week in rent—the rent for the whole house was $540 a week. The $190 he was paying is more than his youth allowance. Many others are in the same boat.

                                     This week I asked my followers on Twitter and Facebook what their experience of housing stress in Melbourne was like. I got an avalanche of responses, and here are some of them:

                                     On a higher-end public servants wage, no way I could afford to buy in electorate Melb. A lifetime of rent ahead?

                                     . Had to move out as student due to affordability issues. Very frustrating.

                                     Housing affordability also has an impact on the wider economy. As Australians for Affordable Housing correctly point out, existing housing is a non-productive investment. In other words, that investment does not directly generate wealth or add to production once it has been constructed. So high prices mean that Australians are spending a large proportion of their income on a non-productive asset that would otherwise be spent on wealth-generating investment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The most extreme manifestation of the failure of the housing market is the number of Australians who do not have a place to sleep—over 100,000 on any given night. Homelessness is a difficult problem with a complex set of causes, but we will never come to a solution to homelessness without affordable housing. It is time we had a national plan to return fairness and equity to the housing market. There are a number of elements that need to be part of that plan. We need to look at everything, from the tax system to greater investment in social housing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     In my electorate of Melbourne, at the moment the rule seems to be: if there is an old warehouse or spare space, knock it down and build expensive apartments. This includes sections of public housing land that is tagged for private development. This is a twofold loss to the community: a loss of public land and a lost opportunity for more affordable housing. Councils must be better able to place requirements for social and affordable housing as part of development projects. Social housing targets should be part of structure plans and strategic statements. It also means greater investment on the part of state and federal government in public and social housing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     It is time we had an economy that puts people first. It is time that we addressed the enormous housing stress that people are experiencing. It is time for our governments to fix Australia's broken housing system. In the coming months I am looking forward to working with members of Australians for Affordable Housing and my Greens colleagues to address this burning issue. Now is the time for action and a concerted effort to make a difference to people's access to housing.

                                      I am prompted to speak this afternoon as a result of the earlier contribution by the Chief Government Whip, reflecting on what has occurred this week and more specifically on what has not occurred. We saw earlier this week an exhaustive amount of time expended by the opposition through the debate on the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office. People will recall that the Parliamentary Budget Office was triggered by two things. The first thing was the incredible situation we had where the coalition turned its back on the legacy of former Treasurer Peter Costello in establishing the Charter of Budget Honesty, requiring of parties to demonstrate that the election promises they put forward are costed properly but, more importantly, can be delivered once in government. Instead, we had the experience of the opposition going to some lower tier accounting firm in the back of WA in an effort to try to dress up costings that simply could not tally with what they were dishonestly putting to the Australian people.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The next thing was that Treasury clearly saw, after the election outcome when the costings were put for both parties' policies, that there was a massive shortfall in the opposition's costings—an $11 billion black hole. A commitment was made for a parliamentary budget office as a result of negotiations between the parties to ensure that there was integrity of election costings and that the public could be sure those costings were thorough and robust and that the promises made could be delivered. The Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office inspected that commitment and came up with an idea of how to put the Parliamentary Budget Office forward. The coalition members on that committee agreed on the need to have this office and then, at some point, the shadow Treasurer turned to the shadow finance minister and said, 'Do you know what this means?' It was then the penny dropped that, in any future discussion about what costings are put forward in an election context, the opposition would need to be able to verify what they were promising and to back it up. They did not want to have the sunlight shine on their election promises.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      What happened? We had the work of this chamber delayed as we saw filibustering over 12 separate amendments to the Parliamentary Budget Office legislation put forward by the other side in a desperate effort to stop and to stymie the office proceeding, yet it was clear to the Independents in particular that that was simply an unacceptable outcome. Secondly, every single amendment, when it was clear that they were not going to get them up, the opposition still put up for a vote.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Why do I reflect on this? Because, frankly, the government has, as has been demonstrated by the Leader of the House, in a minority government where people were predicting we would be unable to get a legislative agenda through, been able to deliver 190 different pieces of legislation. We have demonstrated that this parliament can work. Not satisfied with their inability to frustrate that agenda, the opposition have now sought to embrace a new tactic, which is to waste the time of the chamber, frustrate the program and stop us from being able to get legislation through. We saw, as the Chief Government Whip said, prevarication, flip-flopping between whether or not we would discuss the clean energy bills. As I said before, we had the issue of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the delay and chewing up of time in relation to that. Now we have a situation where, in the interests of their grubby attempt to fundraise, we are unable to proceed with other votes because they want to get out of the House, again demonstrating that if they cannot run the country they will wreck the parliament and that if we cannot govern in the national interest we have to put their interests first. It is simply a disgraceful arrangement that reflects poorly on them, but it is something we have expected from these guys time and time again.

                                           I rise today out of concern for the economic commercial health and wealth of small business in the electorate of Flynn and also the rest of Australia. It is true that the two-speed economy in some industries is doing extremely well, but it is also true that a lot of small to medium businesses who are the life and breath of regional communities are facing severe financial difficulties. After talking to several of my colleagues around Australia, it is not isolated to Queensland but, sadly, is the case in all states and territories.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Why is this? It is, in part, a problem caused by the government itself. Constantly I have businesspeople in my office complaining about too much red tape, too many government charges, too many government regulations, unfair and debilitating taxes, public servants who have no idea whatsoever of how a commercial operation runs and too many government departments who will not allocate government contracts to local businesses. The list goes on and on. I take the recent

                                           scheme. Local builders were told they could not work because they were not certified by the government. How ridiculous is this? In one instance, the Wowan State School in my electorate wanted to engage a local builder for almost half the cost of the government's preferred builder, but even though this local builder was a registered builder under the
                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSA" rel="nofollow">

                                           he was passed over for a national builder who used drive-in drive-out workers. This story has been repeated throughout Australia. Another example of how the government and authorities can get it completely wrong is the case of a sawmill in Eidsvold in my electorate. The Eidsvold sawmill produced electric light poles and it was a growing business. It wanted to process another four truckloads of poles per week, meaning that it would increase its workforce by another five workers, from 19 to 23. The government stepped in and demanded that the company upgrade a perfectly good road in front of the property at a cost of $237,000—not the company's road but a council road. Then the electricity company demanded that the power to the site be upgraded. The original cost of the power upgrade was acceptable to the company, but, as negotiations went on, the company was asked to contribute a further 40 per cent above the cost of providing such services. It was prepared to pay 18 per cent above cost, but 40 per cent was out of its range and blew it out of the market. The sawmill could not afford these unreasonable costs, so it shut down and now the poles are being produced at another sawmill 200 kilometres away. This move put 19 workers, 17 of them Indigenous workers, on the unemployment roll.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Eidsvold has a population of 600 people. According to the latest figures 58 per cent of the population are in full-time employment. The unemployment rate was already 9.6 per cent, so now, because of this uncaring, immovable policy of the government, unemployment has gone up by another 19 people, presumably lifting the unemployment to level to above 12 per cent.

                                           Stories like these are well known all over Australia. The transport industry and regulations ruling that industry need to be brought together throughout the states, and the state transport ministers should unify the rules so that truck drivers and the trucking industry can work no matter what they state they are in. The cost of registration for a B-double cattle truck is approximately $26,000, and a truck can sit idle for six months because of poor road conditions and wet weather. This is a pretty poor reflection on the government.

                                            Earlier in this debate, my friend and colleague the member for Chifley made reference to the behaviour of those opposite during the debate on the Parliamentary Budget Office. I would like to explore this theme a little further. This was an important piece of legislation. It means that for the first time we will have an independent body which is well resourced and has access to the data and the expertise to independently cost promises made by members and parties in the lead-up to an election. We can understand why those opposite spent so much time filibustering and trying to frustrate the passage of this legislation. When this legislation finds its way into law there will be no excuse for those opposite to try to slide into an election campaign, like they did with the 2010 election campaign, without having their promises properly costed. We all know the story of their $11 billion black hole, and that was embarrassing enough for those opposite, but we now know that their fear is that if this parliamentary budget office gets up and running, is well resourced and has the capacity to do its job, their great fraud—the $70 billion black hole that exists within their budget costings—will be verified and available for all to see. That is what they fear the most.

                                            During question time and after question time, we are entertained and admonished by the member for Sturt, who regularly admonishes us for doing what he calls slagging and bagging of those opposite. I believe he may have been in the chamber during some of the debate the other day when we saw one of the most outrageous attacks on a distinguished public servant that I have ever heard in my life. The former head of Treasury,
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Henry" rel="nofollow">

                                            , a public servant of high standing who has served under both sides of politics, was terribly defamed and attacked by the member for Mackellar during that debate, and not one word of defence was heard from those on the other side of the House. It really was a shameful display. But that was not the last we heard of that sort of behaviour, because yesterday they raised a matter of public importance on economic issues. I thought that it was going to be an important opportunity for us to join in a serious policy debate around the important economic issues facing this country. But after 40 minutes we had not heard one positive contribution towards economic policy from those opposite. Indeed we saw a platform for the member for

He went on to continue a theme that is all too prevalent from those opposite by taking the micky and making fun of foreigners. We know that they have some concern with Malaysia and the affairs in that country, but the behaviour we saw from those opposite—particularly from the member for North Sydney—during the MPI debate was nothing short of disgraceful.

                                            Members might recall that, when the member for North Sydney was referring to the Treasurer's award for international finance minister of the year, it was too difficult for them to do the decent, dignified, graceful thing and pass a simple 'congratulations' across the chamber. Instead they decided that they were going to have a shot not only at the Treasurer but also at everyone else who had ever received the award. I pay tribute to Crikey, who have done some investigative journalism on this. He was making fun of previous recipients—a Slovakian, a Serbian, a Nigerian, a Bulgarian and a Pakistani. We later found out that the Pakistani minister, who later became the Prime Minister of that country—

The member for Shortland and I decided to form the group as a response to Australia's ageing population and the challenges that this has brought to the nation. We both sit on the House of Representatives

                                               One of the areas that I am particularly keen to take action on and explore with the PFSA is the aged crisis in Australia. There is a shortage of beds. The government funding model and demographic pressures caused by the ageing population put pressure on the industry, which is teetering on the brink. I have taken a particular interest in this issue in my electorate of Swan, which has many aged-care facilities, such as SwanCare in

I held an aged-care industry forum that was extremely well attended by executives from across the local area, as well as a seniors forum with the member for Mackellar at Bentley Park that sought the views of seniors on this issue.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The message that I took away from these forums is that seniors worry about aged care and want to know that their future is secure. At the same time, the industry is struggling. The issue of bonds is a controversial one, but it is an issue that desperately needs to be looked into. I know from speaking with stakeholders in my area that bonds are a real issue and have been since about 1998, when the Howard government first mooted them for high care. I see now what is happening to some of the high-care facilities in my electorate. Funding by banks has been withdrawn. So they have to reclassify themselves as low-care centres so that they can get bonds so that they can survive and keep the wood in the door. This is an issue that will be faced by many governments and it is something that we need to look at carefully and take action on.

                                               The Productivity Commission report into the restructuring of the aged-care industry was released by the government on 8 August. As yet, the government has not responded to that report. There are 58 recommendations, too many to discuss in the time that I have left. In conclusion, I hope that the House will welcome the establishment of the Parliamentary Friends of Seniors and Ageing.

                                                I want to talk about a recent visit of mine to an active after school program. The Illawarra Primary School has an active after school program at the Kingborough Sports Centre in my electorate. The Kingborough Sports Centre have built a new gymnasium with $1 million of federal government funding, some state government funding and some local government funding. It is a fantastic facility down there and I had the pleasure of officially opening it.

                                                On this occasion, I was down there with the active after schools group. Over the last several years of being a federal MP, I have had many parents, teachers and students write to me about what a wonderful program the Active After-school Communities program is and how much the children enjoy it. I have been very privileged to attend quite a few of these in my electorate, from playing basketball at

                                                'ing with the students from South Arm Primary School. But on this occasion we were playing some games in the new gymnasium down at Kingborough with the Illawarra children. Approximately 5,500 primary school students in Tasmania participate in this program, so it is very popular in Tasmania, with around 90 schools and outside school hours care programs participating in this wonderful program. I was really pleased that Minister Arbib committed $43.9 million to continue this program as part of the recent federal budget. I know that that decision has been very well received in my electorate. Certainly the Illawarra Primary School children have been participating in the program since 2007. Some of the things that the Illawarra children have done just this year include cheerleading, skateboarding, archery, Zumba and soccer.

                                                I also had the pleasure of meeting one of their local coaches, Les Richardson. Les has been doing 40 soccer sessions for Illawarra Primary School over the last 12 months and he was recently presented with a five-star

                                                award, so I want to congratulate Les on that award. It was really pleasant to be with him to see him work and to see the pride he is instilling in his young pupils while teaching them soccer skills in the gymnasium. Certainly his enthusiasm for the children and for the program is second to none. We all know that it is coaches like Les and other people working on a program such as this, people who give their time and effort, who make these government programs such a success.

                                                I also want to talk about the Active After-School Communities office in Tasmania being run by Blair, Aaron and Kerry, who do a fantastic job in organising local sports. They have a very large range of opportunities for the students to participate in. As you have heard, from all the sports I have talked about, it is a great program; it is very well run in Tasmania and the Tasmanian students just love it.

Led by principal Dianne Harper, the centre is embracing gen Y technologies such as interactive whiteboards and iPads to transform the lives of children with profound disabilities. With specially designed applications, or apps, students with otherwise limited communication abilities are now interacting freely with their teachers, families and friends.

The site of an iPad and its proficient operator is enough for children to disregard any barriers that may have once been built by disability. One app allows students to press an icon for their name, home, family, food and drink, to hear a prerecorded sentence which clearly conveys their need or want at the time.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Another fascinating application uses a friendly purple cat to improve speech patterns. The cat asks questions such as: what is your name; where do you live? They are simple questions for you and me but ones that can be hard for some students to answer clearly. The children reply to the cat by speaking into their iPad; their sentence is recorded and played back to them. A thumb's up or a shake of the head lets the child know how clearly they are speaking. The tools used by these young students can also be utilised by those in their teens and older to give freedom of independence. The quick press of a button on their iPhone or iPod using these same apps can clearly express to passers-by the need for assistance at any time.
                                                  </p>

                                                   We take for granted our ability to clearly communicate with others the simplest things each and every day. I take my hat off to these children and their teachers for embracing technology that is giving freedom and independence. I congratulate principal Diane Harper and staff for their dedication to their students and look forward to assisting in the school in the future.

                                                    . Chifley constituent Peter Horwood was engaged by the ABS in April this year on a six-month casual contract. He was appointed as an area supervisor, with his principal aim being to assist with the local conduct of the 2011 census. While he initially received positive feedback from the ABS for his work, about halfway through his engagement period with the ABS management summarily terminated Mr Horwood's six-month casual contract. Mr Horwood visited me last month, understandably distressed about his treatment. I am loath to raise this matter in this forum. However, I have been staggered by the way the ABS has dealt with this matter both in the decisions taken against my constituent and in their failure to adequately deal with the issue when it was raised with them.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    From what I could gather, relations between Mr Horwood and local ABS management soured in July, specifically over two areas. Firstly, the ABS claimed that Mr Horwood did not undertake a training session in the way that was expected. Secondly, the ABS claimed it was not satisfied with the quality of communication between itself and Mr Horwood. Time limits prevent me from going into detail about these matters, but after reviewing the documentation—and sometimes the lack of it—I pretty quickly came to the conclusion that the ABS had dressed up a decision and was now stonewalling and refusing to admit error. For example, on the first matter I raised, I could appreciate that on the face of it the ABS objections to the quality of training conducted by Mr Horwood were serious. But imagine my surprise when I learned that the ABS had present at the training session conducted at Mr Horwood's home a senior manager who at no point took any step to correct those perceived training errors that the ABS believed were so grievous that they warranted the termination of my constituent's contract, impacting negatively on his livelihood. It is these types of examples that concern me about the way in which the ABS had conducted itself.

                                                    I wrote to the ABS indicating that I believed the process of terminating the contract was deficient and the outcome excessive; that the claims that termination was warranted due to a failure to observe process, while there was evidence the ABS did likewise, were surprising; and that the claim that there were problems with the quality of communication between Mr Horwood and the ABS seemed serious but further examination of the claim would not hold that this was a reasonable allegation—it certainly was not durable enough to base a decision to prematurely terminate a contract. The ABS was, quite surprisingly, evasive and initially avoided engaging meaningfully with me on this matter. I finally had a senior

                                                    ABS manager agree to discuss the matter in detail, but it was clear that he was being given instruction on how to manage this issue. This was evident from their letter back to me on 30 August, merely stating that they would talk to me about this issue and would not reinstate my constituent; they refused to address in writing any of the claims and points I had raised.

                                                    Overall, I believe the ABS has deliberately structured these contracts in such a way as to sidestep its obligations. I would expect more from a government agency, but I believe this deliberately reflects an aggressive

There is no moral equivalency to be found here. In 1937, in 1947, in 1967 and a decade ago, the

Essentially because those proposals required territorial compromise and the acceptance of Jewish statehood. Time after time, unfortunately, too many Palestinian Arabs have shown that they despise Jewish political self-determination more than they love their own national independence. That has proved to be a tragic recipe for 90 years of tears, blood and destruction. Speaking at the

When asked about Australia's voting intentions in the UN the foreign minister has hedged and hemmed. The government's stance on the question has unfortunately been a profile in political vacillation and cowardice. We would do well to recall that the ruling jihadist Hamas regime in Gaza is dedicated not only to Israel's destruction but to the murder of Jews across the planet. With such genocidal fanaticism, peace is impossible. Israel will not and cannot agree to the creation of borders to placate the moral cowardice of a world grown tired of the conflict—and nor should it. As

But the contribution of those 36 years of party activism is not measured by the positions Christine held, although she held them with distinction. Her influence was never exerted by control or coercion but by the example she set of thoughtful debate, good humour and respect for others.

Always the champion of the less powerful, Chris defended staff, ensured pensioner rebates were enhanced, expanded access to affordable services and pushed for subsidised accommodation for community groups. Chris was the representative of those who depended most on these services, and she took on that responsibility with passion and with dedication. One example, which will be remembered well beyond inner-Sydney, is her work on sex industry policy. As a widely published researcher for the Sydney Sexual Health Centre, Chris brought her intellect and professional expertise to an area of public health policy often relegated to the margins by local government. The groundbreaking sex industry policy which Chris spearheaded through council received the Royal Australian Planning Institute's annual award for urban planning achievement and became a model nationally and internationally.

                                                      I remember a particularly boisterous local government conference. Chris was explaining the value of regulating sex-on-premises venues rather than pretending they did not exist or demanding that they only be approved on the fringes of the Sturt stony desert. You can imagine the heckling and catcalls from some of the more conservative councillors as Chris delivered a considered, researched, eminently sensible defence of the scheme. It frustrated one particularly obnoxious councillor so much that he demanded to know why such a proposal, which might work well in the depraved areas of South Sydney, was even being contemplated for the moral and God-fearing residents of the

                                                      . Chris paused and explained, quite simply, that surely the Christian generosity of his local residents would also extend to ensuring the health and wellbeing of all such sinners even if, as he suggested, none existed in his own ward. It brought the house down.

                                                      Memories of Chris like this reinforce the remarkable mix of qualities which earned her the respect of her staff and colleagues on council and her local community of Surry Hills. She was a powerful advocate but never belligerent, a fierce intellect but never condescending and a loyal friend and party member but never afraid to challenge orthodoxies. Chris will be sorely missed by the many people whose lives she touched and improved, and local Sydney history is richer for her place in it. Our thoughts are with Max, Isobel, Ellie and Jenny and her Labor Party friends and family.

If we do not address it properly that will show that we have not learnt the lessons from what happened a year ago. I refer to our preparedness to deal with potential flooding. Nearly a year ago was the start of a particular wet period in the state of Victoria which led to two sets of serious flooding, the impacts of which are still disrupting people's lives and making it extremely difficult for them. The government was very quick to put a levy in place to deal with the extra costs around damage to infrastructure and such caused by the floods. But what I want to know is this: what has been put in place to make sure that in the future we have proper warning of flooding events? What has the federal government done almost one year on to improve flood warning and monitoring? Is the

I hope that they have been just as quick to put the technology in place to help communities in my electorate and across Australia deal with subsequent flooding events. I hope that they have the ability to warn communities so that communities therefore have the ability to prepare for future floods.

It has been an absolute pleasure to work with all of the principals and the staff of the schools throughout my electorate over the past two years, from the initial notifications of funding through to the openings of their facilities.

Mobile offices provide a great opportunity to meet with constituents who are otherwise unable to meet with me during the week due to work or family commitments. It was great to see some familiar faces and to talk about current federal issues, including the carbon price, the national disability insurance scheme and various local matters that are affecting residents of Isaacs. Despite all the hysterical antics of the opposition in recent times regarding the carbon price—exemplified by the wild misrepresentations of the member for Indi on her trips to my electorate and, more recently, to the Leichhardt office of the member for Grayndler—people were generally interested in getting the facts on how the carbon price will impact on them and why it is so important to take action on climate change now, and in particular the increases in pensions and the tax cuts that the carbon price regime is going to bring. People were interested to know more about the federal government's household assistance, the assistance that is going to be provided to families and pensioners, and of course the investments that the federal government will be making in renewable energy.

I say to each of the mayors with whom I have regular contact: thank you for your dedication and commitment to your shires and cities, and for your regular audiences offering advice on funding priorities for your areas, along with your ongoing advocacy for the regions. May I say to each of you: your enthusiasm is infectious.

I find them a refreshing source of local knowledge, with a comprehensive understanding of the priorities in each of their respective communities. However, this group also operates in a somewhat unusual way whereby they govern by regional consensus, at times supporting projects outside their areas for the betterment of the greater South-East Queensland. The council of mayors focuses on national, state, regional and local infrastructure priorities. At a national level, the council of mayors infrastructure advocacy program includes formal representation to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, key federal ministers and shadow ministers, all of the Queensland senators and South-East Queensland based federal members, as well as

That will provide further opportunities for football in the area.

Northern New South Wales has a proud history of representation at national level. Since its inception, football across northern New South Wales has grown in strength. In 2009, New South Wales Football celebrated 125 years of football. To date it has produced 98 Socceroos and 27 Matildas. In the northern New South Wales jurisdiction there are 40 local government areas and it comprises seven zones. I congratulate Northern New South Wales Football League on its enormous contribution. I thank the chairman of the New South Wales northern federation for providing me with information on the services that the federation gives to the local community.

No such report was given to the committee by the government or the NBN Co. in time to be considered for this, the first report. Nonetheless, the report was completed in accordance with the statutory requirements setting up the committee.

On 7 July, the two responsible ministers, Senator Conroy and Senator Wong, gave a commitment to the committee chair, Mr Oakeshott, that a report on the progress of the build and the rollout would be provided to the committee by mid-September. Mr Oakeshott responded with thanks and convened a meeting for 20 September to enable consideration of the report. The hearing was duly held on 20 September but no report was provided. We were told by Mr Quigley, the

                                                            The government is treating this committee with complete and utter contempt. The NBN Co. is, for all practical purposes, unaccountable. The government chose to establish this massive, new government telecommunications monopoly, the largest infrastructure project in our nation's history, without doing any cost-benefit analysis, without ever asking the question: is this the cheapest, the fastest or the most efficient way of delivering fast broadband to all Australians? This scheme was apparently—and it has never been denied—concocted on the back of a napkin between Mr Rudd, the then Prime Minister, and Senator Conroy on a flight between Sydney and Brisbane. No proper analysis has been done, and the coalition's attempts to have this project considered by the Public Works Committee in the normal way were frustrated by the government and their partners, the Greens and the Independents.

                                                            The only mechanism for parliamentary accountability for this vast project is the joint committee, yet we have nothing beyond a few generalities from the NBN Co. There is no report and no detail. This is a venture that belongs to the Australian people entirely but the government is treating the representatives of the Australian people with contempt. The ministers gave an undertaking—their words, not mine—to produce a report for the committee by mid-September and then failed to do so. How can the committee do its work if the NBN Co. is not able to tell us what is going on and if we are not able to get access to any reliable information on their activities? These and other concerns of this kind have been raised by the coalition in this report. The report is, on any view, an inadequate document. It has to be an inadequate document because we have not been given the material to enable us to do a report. We are being held in contempt by the government and the NBN Co.

                                                            One of the remarkable features of the government's arrogance in respect of this matter—and, I may say, the NBN Co.'s equal arrogance—is a refusal to recognise that the approach they are taking is utterly unique in the world. There is no other country in the world where a government is spending so much money on broadband services and no other country in the world where a government is building a new telecommunications monopoly. And this is the feature of this project that is absolutely staggering: there is no other country in the world where a government is using legislative and financial power to eliminate competition with the fibre-to-the home network it is building. The hybrid fibre coax network, which passes 30 per cent of Australian households, is, by reason of agreements between the NBN Co, Telstra and Optus, to be decommissioned so that it cannot be used to deliver broadband services. The only justification for doing so—as we note in this report—is the financial position of the NBN Co. At page 68, in the coalition dissenting report, we note:

We need to be aware in this place that there is a very big debate going on around the world in telecommunications about the wisdom of fibre-to-the-home rollouts and around the world telcos are starting to rethink the need for fibre to the home and are questioning whether there is in fact the justification for doing so when there are cheaper and faster methods of delivering broadband upgrades, whether through fibre to the node—bringing the fibre further into the field so that the copper loop is sufficiently short to enable very-high-speed bandwidth to be delivered—by upgrading HFC networks or indeed by the use of 4G wireless networks, which are being rolled out now and which offer the promise of very-high-speed bandwidth.

The problem with that is that the fastest competition in terms of deployment is

That puts wireless in a position, recognising its limitations—and we all understand that it is a shared medium—in a very competitive position. The proposition in favour of fixed line services of fibre to the home is that there is an insatiable demand for speed but around the world telcos, as this report notes, are not seeing that. They note here that:

When you look at the penetration of, say, 100-megabits-per-second services in this region, in Japan and Korea in particular, almost invariably the 100-megabit-per-second product is being taken up because it is either the entry-level product or because it is priced at effectively the same price as the entry-level lower speed. Where you do have tiered pricing—and this is true in Korea in particular—where you have, say, a 50-megabit-per-second service and a 100-megabit-per-second service which is $4 or $5 a month more expensive, the 100-megabit-per-second service is able to achieve only about a 15 per cent market share. Of course, what that is telling us is that the applications that make these very high speeds useful or desirable are not there. You can, of course, take the approach of saying we should just build out the capacity in the hope that in 20 years time the applications will arrive, but that is obviously a reckless approach to spending public money and also one that pays no attention to the time value of money.

Nothing in the comments that he just made would indicate anything else. In fact, the sun would not be coming up—it would not be a proper day—if we did not have the member for Wentworth bagging it. So it is good to see that we are on business as usual. He talks about the committee not being provided with enough information, he thinks, to give a proper report—as if, irrespective of any other information, he would need another reason not to support this project. His complete obsession with micromanagement of a project which, when they were in government, they could not even deliver after 12 years and twenty-something goes is beyond the pale.

I want to address a few, because I have heard them about 20 times already this month. There is a reason why this project is unique and why Australia is continuing down this path. And I do not need any other endorsement—although endorsements have come from far and wide from analysts around the world—than that of the

In fact, in comments he made when he came to Australia he said that he foresees that, in the next couple of years, Australia will make it up the rankings, gradually, from being one of the least effective countries in terms of broadband penetration to being the leader in the world, and the only way he thinks this can be done is by having the project that we have in place. So I take that endorsement on board.

                                                             The member for Wentworth talked about monopoly structures and behaviours again, as if we have not heard that before. The fact is that this is the most pro-competition option possible. By separating the access network from the services layer, we are able to disinfect the effects of vertical integration that have permeated the system to date and have led to a situation where we have not had competition either in infrastructure or in services based competition and where we have not had equality of access for regional and remote areas in particular—and, as the member for Chifley and I well know, in outer metropolitan areas of Sydney. So this is the only way in which we are going to be able to deliver that access.

                                                             I also take issue with the member for Wentworth continually bringing up the debate on fibre versus wireless. The debate is over. It has been done. I bet, if he kept reading from that analysis report, it would conclude by saying, 'Fibre and wireless based services in a high-speed broadband world are complementary.' They are complementary, not substitutes for one another. He also talked about fibre-to-the-node versus fibre-to-the-home analysis. Firstly, none of this is new. In my former life before this place, when I was working in the mid-2000s in Malaysia, developing their high-speed broadband, we canvassed all these issues. This is absolutely nothing new. But what is important and what we actually concluded in our analysis for the Malaysian regulator, in rolling out the system—and, I know, as has also been analysed by other countries in our region who have done their rollouts, like Singapore and
                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">

                                                             —is that you need to structure the most appropriate system of broadband access for the country in question. There is no question that the solution that is adopted in Singapore, South Korea, Japan and elsewhere, given their scale and topography, is going to be different from that in Australia.

                                                             I was startled to find that the member for Wentworth has finally come to the realisation that spectrum is a shared resource and has technological limitations. Fibre is in fact the only technology-neutral platform that is available, because once we have the infrastructure in place (a) nothing is faster than the speed of light and (b) whatever you would like to do using that infrastructure, be it through wireless or other solutions—and that is why we have mobile operators welcoming the

One of those recommendations is that 'government agencies take measures to ensure they are ready for the rollout' of the NBN and to ensure appropriate government service delivery. This is a really important point, and for me it goes to something local as well. I have a new estate,

In the last census, apparently The Ponds was one of the highest users of the e-census option in Australia. It demonstrates the power and importance of governments being able to tap into the lives of everyday citizens and make jobs easy. It is not just about online payment; it is about the whole interaction that we have with government. How many people would have been at home when the census collector came around? I know they came around twice to my place and, of course, I was not home either time. We completed it online. I think this is a very important point and a very strong recommendation that needs to be taken on board.

I note this was raised in the regional consultations that have been made to date. I will touch on one alluded to by the member for Wentworth. There is a recommendation that the minister publish a detailed statement outlining the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the rollout of the NBN. I do not think that will take minister very long to do at all because—and it is important to put this in context—we have a debate going on in parallel where the opposition wants to bring back some of the worst elements of

On page 60, the opposition maintains its position that a national fibre to the home network is incapable of being financially viable or delivering affordable services. This is their running argument with the implementation study. It is like the Japanese soldier lost in the jungle after the war—they are still running around criticising the implementation study when it has been and gone. On page 60 the member for Wentworth, as the author of this dissenting report, says:

Recently at an industry forum, one eminent industry leader commented to me that it is amazing how the member for Wentworth still thinks the NBN is just about 'the internet'.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                             As the ACCC's infrastructure report has consistently displayed, the issue is not just income. The issue is the lack of facilities-based competition to date and that has been the core of the access block. Without competition at the facilities level, combined with the legacy of Telstra's vertical integration as the owner of the CAN, service based competition has been severely impeded in this country. Do not take it from me. You only need to look at the ACCC's decision to maintain the declaration of the Domestic Transmission Capacity Service and its rationale in maintaining the declaration, so maintaining regulation of the DTCS. Facilities based competition remains at the remit of regulatory oversight for a very good reason—intercapital city infrastructure, as one example, is at the heart of competition to deliver affordable and competitive services. We have the old cost-benefit chestnut, which was discussed by the member for Wentworth, which is noted on page 61 and onwards. I find the cost-benefit argument that the member for Wentworth keeps coming back to really interesting, particularly because I did not pick him as a conspiracy theorist. On 7 September at the ACCAN conference in Sydney the member for Wentworth said, amongst other things, that there were no applications forthcoming that could take advantage of the huge bandwidth being made available. I will have something to say about that in a minute. He then went on to talk about the NBN being 'a conspiracy.' It was reported that the member for Wentworth said:
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p class="italic">
                                                             Let me tell you who the conspirators are. They are the vendors, who want to sell lots of kit for the NBN. They'll tell you privately they think it's bonkers, but they want to sell the kit. There are the over-the-top people like Google and Yahoo and media companies.

I have brought this to the attention of the member for Wentworth on several occasions but he obviously chooses not to read them. The Access Economics papers prepared for the department, which are publicly available and very recent, estimate:

                                                             may be in the vicinity of $2 billion and $4 billion per annum.

                                                             The member for Cowper would be interested in this. Another teleworking paper that Access Economics has done talks about the importance of infrastructure savings, saying:
                                                            </p>

As the expenditure on road infrastructure in Australia in 2007-08—

                                                             in 2007-08 alone—

I know that during the last couple of months a lot of us have been going around our electorates talking to disability carers and people with disabilities. We have only to look at the 2007

That is yet another reason why I have been such a vocal advocate for the NBN. I note that the potential for social inclusiveness for people with disabilities can never be measured solely by economic analysis. I know that, as the

The purpose of the report is to provide advice to parliament on the largest infrastructure project in the nation's history. This committee has the responsibility of providing reporting in a timely manner. This committee has the responsibility to keep the parliament and the Australian people properly informed of the status of the project. The committee has the responsibility to highlight deficiencies identified in the rollout of the project. Regrettably, this report rambles on, page after page, and says absolutely nothing. It gives the reader no insight into the progress of the project. It is a document that does nothing other than repeat and bring together material already in the public domain. This is a project that is behind time and over budget and that is not achieving the take-up rates projected in its own business plan. It is a significant failing that in the first report the committee has not addressed the issues of time, cost and take-up rates—the very foundation stones of the success or failure of the

                                                              would be proud of. It is the largest infrastructure project in history, and the government and NBN Co. can spend six months deciding what the KPIs might be. It is little wonder that this is a project running behind time. It is reasonable to assume that the reason the key performance indicators have not been provided is that this is a project that is failing.

                                                              On 1 April this year we had the construction tender process collapse and be abandoned. Tenders were massively over budget. We had 14 tenderers, all notable industry players, who came up with a set of numbers vastly different from the project budget. And what can we conclude here? Was there collusion between the 14 tenderers? There was no

                                                              investigation and apparently no evidence of that. Was the budget inadequate? The government claims the budget is totally adequate, but I am yet to be convinced We have a tender process which was abandoned and a government claiming that the project is still within budget, yet we have not a word on this in this waffling report.

                                                              And then along comes Silcar and everything is fixed; magically, a deal is done within budget. I thought Christmas only came once a year, but there we had a tender process collapsing and, miraculously, out of the blue on the white horse came Silcar. We have a joint venture between Siemens and Thiess which can allegedly deliver the project within budget. I say 'allegedly' because we just do not know and there is nothing in this report that makes us any more confident. We do not know anything about this contract that has been let to Silcar. In the true spirit of the NBN, there is a veil of secrecy and concealment. We do not know the risks that NBN Co. have taken on to achieve this somewhat miraculous change in the value of the construction tender. We do not know who is taking the risk in changes in the cost of labour. We do not know who is taking the risks on the increases in the cost of materials and equipment. We do not know who is taking the risk with regard to extension of time, industrial disputes, bad weather or site conditions. We just do not know, and this report is silent on this very important issue.

                                                              Wouldn't you think that, if you have the largest infrastructure project in this nation's history and you have a major collapse in the construction tender process, it would warrant a few lines of consideration? Wouldn't you think that a committee that has the responsibility of reporting on the status to the parliament would at least raise it and deliberate on that? But no: the report is silent on that issue. The fact is the headline price arrived at with Silcar may be nothing more than a carefully contrived illusion designed to get an incompetent government out of a mess of its own making. The reality is the real cost of this contract may be far greater when all of the risks are finally monetised—a very important point. And did the report properly consider this important issue? Alas, as I said, it did not. Let me look at take-up rates—a vitally important issue and a key foundation stone for the revenue projections in the business plan. It is interesting to note that it would be reasonable to expect that a project with the qualities espoused by the government—the NBN that the country cannot be without—and with all the publicity there would be a stampede to get connected, that people would be knocking Senator Conroy over in the rush to get connected to the NBN. When the Apple iPhone was released, people queued in the snow to buy one. They were so keen to get this new technology, they queued in the snow to buy one. Yet Senator Conroy is struggling to find a queue of people who want get connected to the NBN. He cannot even find a queue.

This compares to the 13,000 projected to be passed under the corporate plan by that date. It is pleasing to note that there is something in this project that has been reported as being ahead of expectations. In response to those 14,256 properties passed, my colleague the member for Bradfield, asked Mr Quigley, 'How many retail customers does the NBN have?' The answer was that he did not know. He knew 14,256 houses had passed by 30 June, but he did not know how many customers he had.

I anticipated that he could have such a Costa Rica moment, so prior to the committee I got my adviser to ring NBN and ask a very probing question. So he rang and asked, 'Could you tell me how many customers you have?' The answer came back, 'I don't know.' So not to be put off by this minor setback, he then said, 'Could you put me on to someone who can tell me how many customers you have?' The person at the other end of the phone not only did not know how many customers they had but also had no idea who in NBN Co. head office was responsible for knowing how many customers they had. So the CEO and NBN Co. head office do not know how many customers they have. That is the management control. We have no advice in this report.

That is not the role of the committee. The role of this committee is to report in a timely way on those matters that are of importance to the parliament—and the matters that are of importance are the timing of the project, the cost of the project, the impact of the take-up rates on the revenue projections of the project—so that the parliament and the people of Australia can know how this project is progressing. We do not want hundreds of pages of gratuitous waffle.

We have a report that assists them in that deception and concealment. This report fails the test sadly. The parliament deserves timely and relevant information. Despite the best efforts of the coalition members in producing the minority report, this report in fact falls far short of what is required for a project of this size.

It is no surprise at all that the opposition members would get up and criticise this report. It is no surprise at all that the opposition would put in a dissenting report. I think the member for Greenway put it very succinctly today when she followed the member for Wentworth: the fact is that the opposition are fundamentally opposed to this policy reform.

But the reality is that you have members on this committee whose sole intention it is to ensure this reform does not go ahead; to spend all of their time questioning witnesses as to whether there is not another course that we can follow—that is, going outside the terms of reference, not looking at whether

We heard it from the member for Wentworth today. I did not catch all of his speech, but I am not surprised that the few seconds I caught talked about fibre to the node once again.

I heard it in 2007, in 2008, in 2009, in 2010 and in 2011. They continue to tell me about the black spots and the huge problems with broadband access, but we have the member for Brisbane—who has stood up in this place, who has made statements outside this place and said how unhappy she is that her constituents are not getting it soon enough—saying how unhappy she is that her past constituents are getting it. I find it amazing that a member who represented the people of Petrie for over 11 years is now complaining that they are finally getting what they deserve, which is fast broadband. I am proud to be the member for Petrie who will be delivering that for them and proud to be part of a federal Labor government that is committed to delivering the

I want to acknowledge the government members on this committee, who come to this committee with a genuine commitment to see this reform rolled out. Importantly, we aim to do our job as a committee properly to make sure that it is rolled out in the best interests of the Australian people, and that NBN Co. and the department do their jobs properly. That is the role of the committee, and we are making sure that we are doing that by fulfilling our roles on the committee, as is the chair of the committee. And I thank the chair, the member for Lyne, for his work on this committee. He is genuinely committed to seeing the NBN rolled out because he understands the benefits of this. They are not just benefits to householders. Again, we are not talking about someone being able to download fast emails or a movie; we are talking about the benefits to health. Only a week ago, we had a display about eHealth, and it was absolutely incredible. If you look at what is already being done in the area of health and talk to the experts about it—and we had some evidence in

It is not just important but imperative that they get that fast broadband so they can start delivering better health services in our regions. There are people who have to travel thousands of kilometres to see specialists and have to be away from their homes and families for a lengthy period of time who could get assistance in their home town—in their homes, even—with the facilities that come with fast broadband technology.
                                                                                  </p>

In our schools, our students who are doing languages are getting online now and communicating in real time with students across the other side of the world. The ability for our education and higher education to expand with faster broadband and newer technology is incredible. We had the opportunity to talk to Nextgen, who had just switched on their new trial of what they say are the fastest speeds in the world—it was a world first—in this tiny room in the middle of Broken Hill with just one little box on the floor. It was hard to imagine what it could achieve, but we went into town and we saw the small box on the footpath and were amazed at the fact that that will be able to connect every single premises in Broken Hill to fast broadband. I know that the businesses and the council in Broken Hill, and the member for that area, cannot wait to get fast broadband there. Members from regional areas understand that. If they do not understand that, their constituents should be asking why they are not out there fighting for this, sooner than later, because it is the regional towns that will benefit most from this.

It is being refurbished and it is going to be used as a major film studio. One of the huge drawcards for that is that, when they have fast broadband, they are going to be able to send the films straight back to the

This is huge for Broken Hill, it is huge for the outer regions and it is huge for the country as far as our economy is concerned. But the opposition just do not get it. They do not understand what this is all about.
                                                                                  </p>

The thing that jumps out at me the most is the need to improve communication and information, especially out into those regional and rural areas. There is still a lack of information about the benefits of the NBN, how it will be rolled out and what stages there are. I know that that information will be coming in the future, in terms of future plans and time frames, but we need to go out and talk to people about the benefits and how it will work, about who is going to get fibre to the premises and who is going to get wireless.

During the committee inquiry, we heard evidence from a person who is involved in the
                                                                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Air" rel="nofollow">

However, from evidence put before the committee just this week, we have been able to clarify with NBN Co. that the School of the Air's understanding was incorrect. In fact, they are not even on that satellite system; that is going to be changed over, so there will be no impact on them at all. But it is about getting the correct information out there.
                                                                                  </p>

It was really unfortunate that there was not one member of the opposition who came out to do those inspections with us. We talked to representatives from Telstra and NBN Co. who were working together. There was a small Telstra substation there, and we went into this building and saw the rows of copper leads going everywhere. They said that this massive row of tangled wires basically covered about 16,000 households. Then they took us over to two cupboards that had little boxes in them. They said they would cover 29,000 homes. They showed us out on the street how the individual premises were connected. It was explained to us by both the NBN Co. and the Telstra representatives that copper can be damaged—it can be damaged simply by floods, by excessive water. The only way to damage fibre is to actually cut it. They said that, even if the fibre to the premises is cut, within half an hour they can have it up and running again. There are huge benefits coming from this NBN project.
                                                                                  </p>

This will be important because we will be getting the report from NBN Co. that sets out the key areas that the terms of reference address, and we will be able to report to this parliament about the key milestones that we have been talking about.
                                                                                  </p>

I am pleased to be deputy chair of this committee. I thank the committee members who are genuinely committed to seeing this policy reform roll out in the best interests of this nation. It is my pleasure to commend the report.

I will be with those rural and remote communities this time next week looking at these very issues, including the issue of the rollout of digital television—which is an absolute disgrace. This government has ignored the wishes and concerns of those communities in remote parts of Australia—the small communities that are being offered a satellite-only service when they have had analog rebroadcast for years and years. It is the rebroadcast that they want, not satellite dishes on private homes. There is a very real issue here that we cannot get the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

I know there is a real worry in those remote communities that this government is not listening to their concerns, whether they be concerns about the digital television rollout or the fibre optic high-speed internet rollout.

I have been driving this agenda on our side of the House almost since I came here. I know the benefits of communication—it is a vital link with trade, education opportunities and health. What we are opposed to is the model and the lack of transparency being proposed under the NBN. We heard the member for Cowper talk very eloquently about this. We want answers. After all, there is a commitment to spend something like $50 billion in this major infrastructure project. Surely there should be transparency and the community and the people—the taxpayers of Australia, the shareholders of NBN Co.—should be entitled to know about some of the rollout proposals and about the take-up that is occurring as the program is rolled out. We acknowledge it is a massive investment, but it should at least be subject to a cost-benefit analysis and transparency so that the taxpayers of Australia can understand and judge for themselves whether this is a good business model or a flawed business model. Any business would be doing due diligence or a feasibility study in relation to a proposition so big—or not even as big as this. Any business, small or large, before they make that investment would be doing due diligence as to whether there is an economic model that stacks up.
                                                                                    </p>

I hope that the members from the regions of Melbourne and Sydney, with their city-centric thinking, might just listen for a moment. I would invite them to come out and talk to these communities in remote parts of Australia and live the life for a little while. They might then have an understanding of what people like me are talking about, because we understand the challenges and we also understand the importance of high-speed internet for those people, particularly in remote parts of Australia. Unlike this model from the government, we said that under our plan we would be building the network from the inside of Australia to the outside. But what this government is doing is rolling it out in some key marginal seats, including the seats of the Independents who gave this government government. It is very cosy. It is a bit like the Regional Development grants that have recently been rolled out. What a disgrace that was.

There we sat down at the Birdsville Clinic with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the clinic nurses. They explained to us that, whilst they have a fortnightly clinic at Birdsville, they are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and they are only two hours away by aircraft if they get the call from the clinic in Birdsville. But it is not just Birdsville; it could be other communities out in the far west of my electorate and other parts of Australia: Bedourie, Windorah, Jundah, Eromanga, Thargomindah and all of those remote communities, including some of the remote pastoral stations where the Royal Flying Doctor Service are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whenever they get the call.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     They explained to us the benefits of e-health. I will preface my remarks by saying that Birdsville and that far western part of my electorate are connected by radio links to the mainframe, if I could put it that way. The mainframe is the optic fibre network that extends across this nation; the Telstra legacy optic fibre interconnects between communities. These communities out there are connected by a radio signal—a microwave link. The clinic nurse said that, if they get a situation where they have a person who presents at the clinic and they take an X-ray of the situation that they are concerned about, they will transmit it to the Royal Flying Doctor Service or a medical practice far to the east, in a capital city or a big regional town. But the problem is that they are transmitting that signal through a single-channel radio microwave link over about 800 kilometres—600 kilometres in some cases—to the nearest optic fibre cable, and then it is transmitted either to the Royal Flying Doctor Service base in Charleville or to a regional centre further east with a major medical practice. The signal that they send now is not high resolution because it is going through a radio signal. If they had optic-fibre cable connections in that far western part of my electorate they would be able to transfer a high-resolution image to the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Charleville, and they might refer it on to Brisbane for another opinion. But they are unable to send a high-resolution image now because, as I said, they are not connected to the optic-fibre cable main trunk route at all. They are connected by microwave link.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     They said that if there is any doubt they call the Royal Flying Doctor Service, as you would imagine they would, so the doctor will be there and they will pick up that patient and they will evacuate them to Charleville to do an X-ray and then transmit it, if necessary, via optic-fibre cable to a capital city or regional centre if they are seeking a second opinion. It would be a high-resolution image. Every retrieval out of Birdsville costs $8,000. It may be that it is just a retrieval to take an X-ray to get a high-resolution image for a second opinion on a situation that they are dealing with. If that evacuation were not necessary—because they had that optic-fibre cable connection—they could deal with it on the spot and make a decision and it could well save having an $8,000 retrieval just to have an X-ray done and return the patient to Birdsville if all is clear. That is an example of the cost of providing a medical service in some remote communities and the problem here is they are not connected by optic-fibre cable to the main optic-fibre network across this nation.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     The communities out in the far west of my electorate that come to my mind immediately—the Diamantina, Barcoo and Quilpie shires—have said that they would put money towards an optic-fibre cable to connect their towns to the main optic fibre line. They are prepared to put up $3 million or $4 million of their ratepayers' money towards that and what they require from this government, in a partnership arrangement which our policy would have allowed and does allow, is about $15 million to $20 million and then they would be connected to the main optic fibre line. That is a real partnership and that is the sort of investment that could happen under our policy, but we do not see it coming forward under this government's policy.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     You might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker, how many evacuations would a town like Birdsville have? The week before I was there and they had three evacuations at $8,000 per evacuation. The day that I was there, leading up to the Birdsville Outback racing festival and the Birdsville races, there were over 6,000 people in town. The population of Birdsville and the Diamantina shire is about 300 people but about 30,000 tourists go through there every year. So we are not dealing with a population of 300; we can often be dealing with 4,000 or 5,000 people at any one time. I said to the Royal Flying Doctor Service clinic staff there, 'Do you get many people travelling through who need medical attention?' and was told, 'Every day.' It might be seniors and older people in their Winnebagos doing their big trip around Australia and needing prescription drugs, or maybe just a health check. What would be of great benefit to those communities is to have the back-up of an optic-fibre cable connection into the main line to support the decisions of the practitioner nurses and the clinic nurses that are there throughout the day and are available throughout the night.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     The other concern I want to raise relates to those small communities of less than 500. As I understand it, they are now connected by clear-voice signal, a telephone, via copper wire. I understand it is the intention, should the shareholders of Telstra approve the arrangement, that the copper wire will be owned by NBN Co. NBN Co.'s role in those small communities is not to roll out optic-fibre cable, as we heard from the deputy chair today, but to provide a voice service to those communities by satellite. What a backward step! You have a viable copper wire system in some of those small communities and that is going to be trashed and replaced by satellite for a clear-voice signal. I have used a clear-voice signal via satellite and I can assure you there is always a latency in the voice and you almost have to say 'over and out'. Maybe satellite technology will improve over time, but I urge the government not to scrap the copper wire in those communities.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     I also want to say something on the optic fibre cable rollout to the premises. I heard the deputy chair of the committee say that copper wire can be destroyed. Well, a lot of that copper wire has been out there for more than a hundred years and it still has life in it. I noticed that the member for Chifley said: 'Optic fibre cable won't be affected by floods; the only disconnect would be if it were cut.' If you have a power failure in your area and you are connected by optic fibre cable, you will be off the air unless you have power and are able to power up the signal that is coming via the optic fibre cable, because optic fibre—glass, in other words—does not carry current; copper does. That is why, when people are connected to the optic fibre cable only, they will need a battery backup for when the power goes down. They will need to have batteries and make sure that they remain fully charged. So this notion that optic fibre cable cannot be destroyed and will not go down is wrong. You get blackouts. And what happens in big floods when the power is cut? We have seen massive floods recently. If you lose your power under an optic-fibre-only connection to your home, you will not have a connection—unless you have a battery backup—because you are going to trash the copper wire.

Because in the 19 times that they had the opportunity to fix this up, they were unable to do it and unable to provide any oversight whatsoever. We have here, in the nation's parliament, a joint committee of both senators and members—many of whom, I am proud to say, are serving the country well on this committee: my colleague the member for Greenway, who is here; the deputy chair, the member for Petrie; and, even though I have deep differences at a policy level with him, the member for Bradfield brings a lot to bear. But, having said that, that is where I have to depart because, even though they know well what is required to be done, they work their hardest to frustrate the need to do something that escaped them 19 times. The deputy chair, the member for Petrie, reflected very positively on the work of the member for Lyne, the chair of the committee, who tried to ensure both sides of the debate were accommodated through the work of the committee. But at some point something has to give when, effectively, we have Luddites on the other side. We have been open and accountable and have been met with nothing but frustration from a phalanx of technological Luddites on the other side who lack the vision and the ability to contribute to this debate. Remember that these are the people who keep arguing that we needed a cost-benefit analysis of the

They knew there was a benefit that would come from upgrading our network to ensure that everyone could get access to broadband. They tried it 19 times and now they are calling for a demonstration of benefit when they knew full well that it was there and needed to be done.

They never did it on the Adelaide to Darwin railway, the plans that were put forward at the tail end of the Howard government. At no time did they provide a cost-benefit analysis, but they keep arguing about cost-benefit analysis in this place simply because it will frustrate the process of doing something that they failed to do.

The member for Greenway pointed to the Deloitte Access Economics report—and I was very grateful that she did. That report talks about $27 billion of productivity benefit generated for business and government because it has improved the way they work by getting access to the internet. What was the opposition's response? Via the member for Wentworth, the opposition's response was to bag out Google and to criticise Deloittes for putting forward this economic work. It is simply astounding. Any time any person seeks to put forward a different view to those opposite, they will not respect those views and they go out of their way to challenge them.

The ACCC said that having fibre to the premises was our chance to finally rid ourselves of the competition devils that had held us back in the sector—a sector dominated by one major player that continued to crowd out any ability for new players to come in, for new innovation and for someone else to take up the communication challenges facing the country. And the opposition say, 'Why did we move from our initial plan to the end plan of where we are at? Why did we move from the $5 billion plan to $43 billion plan? They know full well, and the member for Bradfield knows full well, that the reason for that was that the major dominant player in this country submitted six pages for a $5 billion tender for the major upgrade our telecommunications network. Those six pages clearly demonstrated that the major player in this country under the former leadership of

We had an ossified industry dominated by one player. We wanted to smash through a calcified telco sector. What did we get? We got the opposition criticising us for something that had, frankly, bedevilled them. They knew the frustrations. You only need to spend five minutes with former senator

Telstra were refusing to invest because the ACCC would not give them a green light to rip off consumers, again under the former leadership of Sol Trujillo, and it was something that the former government was not prepared to countenance either. We know they had problems. We wanted to smash through those problems. You would think they would want to join with us. They do not. They spend their time bagging it out. We had to step up.

The member for Greenway knows it. I understand the member for Bradfield—as I have reflected on earlier, I have regard for his industry expertise and regulatory expertise—has been told he has to run a line which he knows, in his heart of hearts, is not the right one to run. We have a debate: fibre versus copper, with its limitations in capacity; copper, with its limitations because of its fault rate. As reflected on by the member for Petrie, the minute you get moisture in it, faults go through the roof. We know we have a chance. We can either keep rolling out copper with its limitations or we can say: 'Righto. We know this is an old technology. We're going to go to the one that actually works and that's optic fibre.'

Nothing better demonstrates that the shadow minister for communications simply has no idea when he keeps advocating HFC, when he talks about Sydney and Melbourne and 30 per cent of homes having HFC. Everyone knows that HFC chokes up. Once you have Foxtel, subscription TV, running through your home and you are trying to rely upon that plus another signal for internet access, you are going to become choked up.

Everyone knows that when more people are on wireless at one particular time wireless cannot deliver, that it slows right down. So they say to us 'HFC', they say to us 'wireless' and then they say, 'We don't even need to go down this path. Why don't we just do a black spots program,' and then condemn the rest of the country to inconsistent speeds. We are talking about a uniform network with massive download speeds and fantastic uploads. That is the big thing: the fact that there are greater upload speeds in this network. We say, 'Regardless of where you live, we want, in 93 per cent of cases, to have you connected to the network of the future,' and they say, 'No, we want you to have a patchwork network that won't deliver.'

I said earlier in a head-to-head contest people know—wireless versus optic. I might reflect rightly on the words of the member for Greenway who said, 'It isn't a case of competition; it is about being complementary, that wireless and fibre have a place together in this network.' Head to head fibre versus wireless—we know who wins. Why? The answer was delivered to us by the member for Sturt when he chaired a committee which clearly said, 'Hands down, fibre wins.' They know it. The member for Bradfield, with his expertise, knows it. The people in the know, the people I joined on this committee, the member for Greenway—they know it but the opposition still argue that we have to be down this path.

The member for Cowper says, 'The NBN cannot tell us numbers.' I think we are expecting too much from a bloke who should know that the NBN is a wholesale network and it does not necessarily keep the retail numbers because the

It is not the wholesaler's job to keep the retail numbers; it is the RSP's job. It is the RSP's process to go through the activation mechanism. It is their job to do it.

As the member for Greenway rightly said, they only see it as the internet; they cannot see it as a broader application of this network. They sneer down from positions where their constituents have access to a great network. In constituencies that I am representing—for example, Woodcroft—the network is jammed and people have to leave that suburb for somewhere else to get a connection. Wireless does not even work. We are trying to do something for the people of Western Sydney and the people of regional Australia, and they, from their positions with constituents who do not have these problems, say to us, 'The best you should get is a second-rate option,' and 'Stop always hoping for the Bentley when the best you can get is a Commodore.' That is the line they use.

It is that the best you should hope for is the second-best option. 'You do not deserve a network that we already enjoying.' That is what they are saying to me. That is what they are saying to the member for Fowler. That is what they are saying to the member for Greenway. It is what they are saying to members opposite who have to toe an insane party line. When they talk about this report in this place, remember this: they cannot be trusted. People in the general community know they cannot be trusted on this issue, because their sole job is to destroy this network and to deny opportunity to the people of Western Sydney. They talk with a forked tongue and a dead policy head.

This is a fairly rich claim in the week when Labor have introduced legislation to introduce offshore processing after years of telling us it was not what they believed in.

What is in my heart is very much the same as what is in the heart of the member for Wentworth and of the coalition generally when it comes to the question of broadband. We are firmly in favour of upgrading Australia's broadband infrastructure. We are in favour of doing that in a rational and cost-effective way in which the private sector takes the maximum degree of load and where government spending concentrates on areas of market failure. By contrast, the member for Chifley has sought to portray this issue as some kind of class struggle and argue that in the coalition we are asserting that areas represented by him and others in this place which have inadequate services should remain and suffer those inadequate services while we, it would seem in his view of the world, swan around in

That is not in question at all. There are many areas, including outer suburban areas, where Telstra has put in pair gains systems for what were good operational reasons at the time and people in those areas simply cannot get DSL today. There are plenty of areas where people do not get adequate broadband—that is not in question for a second—but it is one reason why we have argued that it makes sense to closely analyse the strategy underlying the National Broadband Network, announced in such haste in April 2009, under which a gold-plated, Rolls Royce fibre-to-the-premises network would be built to 10 million premises.
                                                                                                 </p>

These are serious questions. That is why the coalition have consistently called for a cost-benefit analysis, because it is a respected and well-understood methodology for dealing with the questions of how much money ought to be spent on particular projects, what the design of those projects should be and, in turn, what the benefits are that are obtained as a result and therefore does it make sense to proceed with the project and allocate scarce government funds to it, in a world where, as we all know, there are many more claims on the government purse than can all be met?

One consequence of the strategy that has been adopted is that, in many areas where there is inadequate broadband today, Australians in those areas could well be waiting up to nine or 10 years before they get a new service because of the strategy which has been adopted, which is to build a brand-new network from scratch.

But there is a second and quite distinct perspective that we bring to this issue, which is a concern to ensure that to the extent the policy is being pursued we want to understand how it is being pursued, the operations of

More importantly, that is what the parliament wants the committee to be doing. That is why the parliament has established this joint committee so that NBN Co. can be subject to proper scrutiny, bearing in mind, as we are repeatedly told, that this is the largest infrastructure project in Australia's history and that, notwithstanding the various assertions and promises that were made at various stages of the long and convoluted broadband policy debate, all of the money that is being spent on this massively expensive project is coming from taxpayers. Not one cent is coming from the private sector, despite the fact that Labor took a policy to the 2007 election, which involved a joint venture between government and the private sector, with private sector paying at least 50 per cent and despite the fact that when the April 2009 announcement was made to move to a fibre-to-the-premises policy we were told that there would be private sector investment from the start. None of that has happened and the substantive reason is that the advice the government received from McKinsey and

The private sector would not touch this with a barge pole. This is a very bad investment. That is not of itself, I would readily agree, the same question as whether it would pass a cost-benefit analysis. It is certainly true that when you do a cost-benefit analysis you take account of benefits which may not be captured by the company that builds the network. But it certainly raises the very obvious question: if the private sector thinks this is such a disastrously bad investment, why on earth are we not at least going through the exercise of weighing up, of quantifying, those benefits and assessing them compared to the costs?

I have to report, with regret, that the committee is not working very effectively. We have had an unsatisfactory and an uncooperative attitude from the National Broadband Network company and from the government. We saw that at the committee's hearing on Tuesday night. The committee had asked, through its chairman, that regular key performance indicators be provided. A jointly signed letter was sent to the chairman by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

When we assembled for the committee meeting on Tuesday night, we were told that the key performance indicators were not available. We further learned that they had been provided to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on 19 August—more than one month before the date of the committee's hearing—but the department, presumably following a direction from the minister or his office, had declined to provide them to the committee. There is no other word for it; this is a farcical state of affairs when it comes to a committee which is supposed to be overseeing the operation of the National Broadband Network company.
                                                                                                 </p>

                                                                                                  I make a point based upon my own experience on the senior leadership team of a major telecommunications company. In my years on the senior leadership team of Optus, every week there was a weekly trading meeting attended by the chief executive, the heads of major business units and the heads of key corporate functions, including me. Each business unit provided a written report on key metrics—actual, forecast and budget; metrics, such as sales performance by week and cumulatively; new connections and new cancellations; churn; average revenue per user; acquisition costs; and customer service metrics such as call answer rates and abandonment rates. This data also went to the board on a monthly basis. These are the basics of running a telecommunications company.
                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                  I have no doubt that Mr Quigley has such data when it comes to the National Broadband Network company, or at least an analogous version of the data, having regard to the fact that NBN is a wholesale and not a retail operator. It would be a very straightforward exercise to provide a report on key performance indicators to the committee and it is deeply disappointing that the government has failed to facilitate the provision of that information. It is unclear where the responsibility lies between the government and NBN Co., but it is just an extraordinary proposition that, with several months notice, this information was not provided.

The member for Chifley spoke about the fact that Telstra was subject to price regulation by the

The NBN Co. is similarly to be subject to such regulation. It is required to lodge a special access undertaking with the ACCC to obtain approval for the wholesale prices it is going to charge. In the documents lodged by the NBN Co. with the ACCC it has proposed that, for services other than the entry-level service, it will be allowed to increase its prices by

When you do the maths and work out the compound rate of growth that represents, if you plug in an inflation rate of two per cent or three per cent, you get to an enormous multiple. An enormous price increase is permitted. This is a very important issue.

The government is taking active steps to shut down services on other networks, such as the Telstra network and the Optus network, and indeed the government has legislated to prevent other companies building new networks and being permitted to operate high-speed services over those networks. This is, frankly, an extraordinary way in which to deal with the issue of telecommunications competition. Two very well respected international economists—

I think this means equity to be obtained from the private sector. The committee is in no position to make any progress in investigating this, because the National Broadband Network Companies Act, section 45, explicitly says that only the Commonwealth may hold shares in NBN Co. and all of the paid-up share capital must be held by the Commonwealth. There is no scope for private equity and it is somewhat mystifying why the committee thinks that this matter is worth pursuing. This is a report which is a testament to a poor policy, an anticompetitive policy and a policy which is not exposed to the degree of scrutiny the government says it is committed to.

The grand slam title is well deserved and comes as no surprise as Aussie tennis fans have followed Sam's career closely and have watched this star steadily rising. While this title is a further boost to Sam Stosur's career, it is also another boost to sport across this nation. It is a reminder to young girls, in particular, that reaching the heights of this international sport and many other international sports is possible. I am sure this month will see thousands of youngsters picking up a tennis racquet, probably for the first time, or just renewing their interest in the sport and helping to develop a more active and healthy future for Australia.

She was playing well and was on a 25-match winning streak, including the pro-tour North Queensland series in Cairns. However, the 17-year-old Stosur lost her quarter final match in Home Hill. Home Hill fan Kate Casswell last week reported that she could not remember if Stosur had won or lost the quarter final but remembered the future star standing out with her ability to serve and volley. Of the match, Ms Casswell said, 'The reason I remember her game was because her game was scheduled to be played at 7 pm but there was a cane fire and smoke was wafting across the court so they had to delay the start.'

By 2006, Stosur and Raymond were ranked No. 1 in the world in doubles, at one stage winning 18 matches in a row.

The disease forced her to take an extended break from the game as she fought to recover. To her credit, Stosur fought back from her illness and began her rise through the world rankings. In 2009, she reached the semifinals at the

In 2010, Stosur beat three former No. 1 players on the road to the final of the French Open, which she unfortunately lost. After a difficult start to the 2011 season she has finally broken through to win the most coveted of tennis prizes: a Grand Slam event.

Unlike so many of the great players in world tennis, she did not burst onto the scene as a precocious teenager. Her success has come through hard work and sacrifice. Her fans marvel at her powerful groundstrokes, delicate volleys and pinpoint serves; however, we do not get to see the countless hours of practice and training. We are not privy to the moments of self-doubt. We do not experience the sweat, tears and loneliness of practice on deserted outside courts. For her, every victory was difficult.

Australia values its sporting heroes, and Samantha Stosur has been elevated to the very highest echelon of modern Australian legends. She can be very proud of her achievements, and I sincerely hope this victory is not the last Grand Slam win for Samantha Stosur.

Stosur praised Taylor for continuing to believe in her through her difficult start to the 2011 season. Coaches are often the first to be criticised when things are going wrong and the last to be congratulated when things are going well, so it is to his credit that David has stuck by Sam through the good times and the bad.

Sporting success at the highest level is the result of skill, physical fitness and mental toughness. What we see at the victorious end of the championship final is the culmination of an elite athlete putting together all these factors. We the spectators do not see the endless hours of repetitive training and cross-training in skills, fitness and strength. We do not see the early mornings, the long hours or the injuries that come on the long path to success. We do not share the times of physical exhaustion, agony and self-doubt when we watch the final hours of the tournament and the lifting of the trophy. But what we and all Australians should acknowledge is that Samantha Stosur's great victory was created over many years of self-sacrifice and dedication. It was not luck, her turn or as a result of any greater reason than sheer determination, great skill, together with physical and mental toughness.

However, as the first couple of games of the second set passed, we saw the crowd become almost ferocious in its support of Williams, a bit like the ferocity Williams displayed towards the umpire in the match. Williams fought back and broke Stosur and, for just two games, it looked as though Williams was on her way back. However, as testament to Stosur's mental fitness, she fired two aces and reverted to the dominant display that saw her win the first set. She then went on to win the remaining games of the match.
                                                                                                       </p>

The tiered seating at such venues ensures that the enthusiasm and the noise of the crowd are focused on the players. Stosur was reported as saying: 'You know, it was probably the loudest I ever felt a crowd in my whole life. You're right in the middle of it. For sure it was difficult to stay focused and then obviously the crowd got heavily involved.'
                                                                                                       </p>

The timing of the match, being September 11, may well have been a factor but, in any case, it would have been extremely difficult for Stosur to continue playing at her best. It is therefore right that I make mention of these conditions as a factor when considering exactly what sort of an achievement this win was: a premier event, a very partisan crowd and against a very tough and in-form opponent.

Apparently, it was quite a challenging time for Stosur but, again, it comes down to an elite athlete acknowledging the limitations in themselves, determining to be the best person they can be and, in this case, working to lift her mental toughness and position herself psychologically to strengthen her self-belief. Again, this is not something we are along to observe when we watch the final but it is, nevertheless, a vital aspect of an elite sportsperson as they strive to bring all factors together at the right time in order to achieve a victory.

A champion athlete, she has had her great skills and physical strength, and her overall performance, held back by this shortcoming on the psychological side. That shortcoming has clearly been fixed, as she overcame the most difficult of psychological challenges, being up against a very famous and very tough opponent in a very hostile venue.
                                                                                                       </p>

I also suspect that the days of sleeping in dodgy hotels and scrimping and saving will become distant memories for Samantha Stosur.

May there be many more. I also hope that the children of Australia look to her as an example of how great success is achieved through hard work and dedication to your dreams, rather than a misplaced belief in luck.

What a role model. In her winning address to the arena, Sam said, 'This was a dream of mine to be here one day.' Enough said. For every athlete, scientist or even politician the dream is the same and the dream is different. The goal is a grand slam, a medical breakthrough, a pleasing result for a constituent—all of which signal we are doing our best; we are doing the right thing. Sam Stosur's triumph reminds us all of the dreams and visions we have for our jobs, our roles and our lives.

But, while we all grow up with these great sporting memories, the feats of our sporting champions like Samantha Stosur take years of sacrifice and dedication and a driving ambition to reach the pinnacle of their particular sport.

She is an inspiration not only to our young tennis players but to all who strive to achieve their best in their chosen field. This is particularly the case with Sam, as not too long ago she was sidelined for a year of her career, suffering from the debilitating Lyme disease. This illness happened at a time when Sam was just hitting her stride as a single player and, as we all know, a year out from the intense training and tour circuit with which all your competitors are engaged puts you a long way behind the pack. This illness definitely seems to have left its mark on Sam, who lists one of her greatest fears in life as 'deer tick-carrying Lyme disease'. But, more than that, Sam is quoted as stating that it was this time away from the game—not by choice—that taught her to evaluate what she really wanted from the game and truly appreciate the opportunities she had to achieve her ambition to become a tennis champion. She has, without doubt, engaged this attitude, and we as Australians can now celebrate our first women's grand slam winner in 31 years.

Sam tells stories of how devoted and supportive her entire family was to her love of tennis. It was her brother who originally convinced their parents to put Sam into tennis lessons at the age of 13.

In typical Aussie style though, Sam notes this as one of her favourite memories. Therein lies one of the reasons for Sam's tremendous following around Australia. She has a great humility and extreme generosity. She loves to compete and cares far more about the sport and playing than she does about the fanfare and success.

I think that this is, in part, what makes Sam's win so inspiring. She had the courage to ask for help to overcome the mental challenges of the game and acknowledged that physical fitness is not the only factor for success. This is an important message for all Australians, be they aspiring sporting champions or not, that mental wellbeing is just as important in life as physical wellbeing, and that is it okay to ask for outside help to get a different perspective on your problems and concerns. It helped Sam Stosur win the US Open and that is a pretty big endorsement.

It was an achievement that all of us congratulate her for. It is a particularly significant achievement when you also consider that this is Sam Stosur's very first win. She is 27 years of age, which is an age when many sporting commentators say that people are past their prime. I am delighted that she has been able to prove those people wrong, and has been able to prove it with such aplomb. Sam Stosur has gone through a number of battles, as has been mentioned, throughout her tennis career. The most significant, of course, was her battle with Lyme disease, which took her off the circuit and forced her to evaluate her tennis career. However, she demonstrated to all Australians just how you go about being a winner: through perseverance, through dedication, through hard work and, of course, through skill. She was able to achieve that, and we saw that just recently.

She is somebody who is a great role model for all Australians, but in particular young women. I know that for many years to come she will take that role very seriously not only in the way that she continues to achieve on the court but also in the contribution she makes off the court. So we congratulate Sam Stosur; her mother, Dianne; her father, Tony; and her brothers, Dominic and Daniel. We congratulate all of those people who have helped her to achieve in her career, because nobody achieves these things alone; and we congratulate, most importantly, Sam Stosur.

He had told me of the time lapse in when he would arrive for his practice sessions with her after school, as she had a timetable that allowed her to arrive early. Unlike an average 14- or 15-year-old girl, Sam would practice her serve. It was interesting to see that later in her career—her very young career at that point—her serve became her great weapon. I maintained at the time that it was a reasonably modest claim that Sam had the greatest second serve in the history of women's tennis.

This came on the eve of Wimbledon, after a season that had had mixed results for Sam. While she had started the year by getting to the finals in Brisbane and in Sydney and had had chances to win, at that final hurdle she became a little unsure of herself, not believing or understanding the full extent of her talent. This, maybe, was revisited in Birmingham, which is just a week prior to Wimbledon, when she played the defending champion,

Maria had won Wimbledon the previous year at just 18 years of age and was thought to be a hot favourite again. Sam played a most magnificent match. She lost closely—6-4 in the third set. She served and volleyed beautifully. She displayed her athletic ability and her ability to volley. Her ability to play a greater depth of tennis was growing; it was no longer just a 'serve and go for a winner' approach. She was maturing.

There is a saying in tennis that you only learn from your losses and that your greatness comes from how you deal with a loss. If you learn and then go back onto the practice court, work with your coach and practice the things that led to that loss, you are taking full responsibility for that loss and you are doing something about it; you are not admitting that you are a loser. This has certainly been the course that Sam Stosur has chosen to follow. It is not an easy course. There have been many great disappointments. Sometimes with great expectation, when you have losses, they are that much more difficult to handle.

After nearly beating Maria Sharapova at Birmingham, Sam was injured the next day and was unable to practise for the next nine days prior to Wimbledon. She practised briefly on the Saturday, she practised a little bit on the Sunday and she lost to a player in the first round of Wimbledon. This is why my predictions of her possibly winning the event were not seen to be good—they were about a girl who had only ever once played at Wimbledon and who had only once won a match.

Attesting to her character, she then picked up and played in the doubles event—and won it. That not only gave her that fabulous first grand slam win, it also made her the No. 1 female doubles player in the world. You can see that path from the disappointment of the first round loss, through what she has taken from the many losses and some successes, to arrive on the centre court on this historic date to play

She has not won Wimbledon yet, but we keep our fingers crossed.

I would like to reflect that the world has made a number of turns since that day—that day of learning—and I would say that the day that she beat Serena was the best day of her life.

Showing great foresight, great vision and great knowledge of the game, Mr Alexander has proven himself correct, and a great identifier and spotter of tennis talent in this country. I congratulate him on that, because the media can be a vicious game, and he had put himself out there by making what I think was a very brave call in the media, which the public could see—very much as he is doing now as the member for Bennelong—and he has been proved right.

I grew up with a father who was a very keen tennis player and loved to regale us with stories about the great players, and he thought that the best Australian female tennis player we had ever seen was Margaret Court. He used to tell me a lot about her famous victories, especially in grand slams. I was privileged enough to watch Evonne Goolagong, as she was then, win Wimbledon in 1980 on the television, and I have to say it was a courageous win and a fantastic win. The way she represented not only Australia but also our Indigenous communities was an absolute credit to her.

It has not been easy for her. Over her career, she has had to fight injury. She also had to fight through a stage in the nineties when tennis, especially female tennis, in Australia really declined, and she has very much led the charge to get women's tennis back up to the place it should be—that is, where we are competing for grand slam titles.

She had tough matches right through. Then, when it came to the final, in coming up against a Williams sister—as my learned friend in these matters, the member for Bennelong, said—it was probably the greatest battle that she was ever going to fight in her life and she did it with style. Let us not forget the background to it as well, because in that match the whole of the crowd was rooting for a US victory. Sadly, there was a little bit of bad sportsmanship and a little bit of egging on to get the crowd really eager for that US victory. She had the mental strength—and I think there were some that had questioned whether Sam did have the mental strength—to put all that behind her, and she single-handedly and determinedly went about securing what was a magnificent victory.

Ms Everett attributes the hospital's strong showing to the high standard of clinical care and a 'holistic personal touch'. The points raised by Ms Everett are important when considering the issue of local healthcare provision. The Bentley Hospital, which is also in my electorate of Swan, is another small-scale hospital built around elective surgery. Last year I campaigned on behalf of the community for elective surgery to be maintained at Bentley Hospital, and I am pleased to say this campaign was successful. I have also been campaigning for maternity services to be retained at Bentley Hospital. This is important, given the number of young families in the area. We have managed to gain a commitment from the state health minister that he would maintain the maternity services and have them reviewed in 2014 to see what the community need is.

I spoke about the situation of Australians living with disease, specifically adhesive arachnoiditis, and called for an inquiry into their circumstances. I spoke about how the disease slowly shuts down the body. A trip to the hospital can become an ordeal in its own right for those people. Local hospitals are of value to the community, in particular people with those types of diseases.

Announced on federal budget night, 20 August 1991, by then Treasurer John Kerin, this reform was fundamental in shaping the superannuation system as we know it today, as well as a key policy for addressing the need for all Australians to have adequate retirement savings.
                                                                                                                </p>

Not only has the superannuation guarantee made all workers shareholders in their own destiny; it has improved the economy for generations to come. The more private savings that people have to retire on, the less younger workers need to pay in tax to support those retirees. The more of our own money we have in retirement, the less we must rely on the age pension.
                                                                                                                </p>

Yet it is timely in present circumstances to remember that at the time of its introduction it came under attack by the then opposition, who made baseless predictions about the supposed damage—with no corresponding benefits—that universal superannuation would wreak on Australian workers and the economy.

How wrong they were. Today, we have a multitrillion dollar industry of funds under management, developed over the past 20 years, creating jobs and investment in sectors not even imagined at the time of its inception, both within and beyond financial services.

The package of Stronger Super reforms, announced yesterday by the Assistant Treasurer, continues the long tradition of Labor governments delivering for Australian workers. Under the Stronger Super reforms, Australians will benefit greatly from a new era of low-cost superannuation through the introduction of the MySuper proposal; new data and payment standards for superannuation transactions under the SuperStream proposal, which will make it easier for superannuation funds and their members to locate and consolidate multiple accounts; and improving standards of trustee governance and strengthening the requirements for trustee directors to act for the benefit of members.

We have come a long way since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee system itself. We recognise the importance of a considered and market-leading retirement incomes policy, and we are delighted to continue our push to ensure every Australian has the opportunity to enjoy a dignified retirement. Lifting the rate of superannuation from nine to 12 per cent continues this government's commitment to working Australians. We do this for the over eight million Australians with superannuation accounts, their families, future generations, the funds and wealth management industry which continue to grow as we speak, Australian enterprise which benefits from our savings pool, and our citizens generally. They know that superannuation is an institutional Australian pillar, like Medicare, the minimum wage, the age pension and a national disability insurance scheme. This is why it is so ironic that those opposite cannot bring themselves to support the proposed increase from nine to 12 per cent. In fact, those opposite who were elected to this place prior to 2004 enjoy superannuation benefits which are defined benefits and notional contributions well in excess of the proposed 12 per cent for most Australians. They must realise that we have a superannuation system that is the envy of the world. They should not stand in the way of genuine reform, building on the history of this success, and this government's commitment to improve the superannuation system for future generations of Australians.

It is the first Henty field days I have not been able to attend, because of parliament sitting on those three days, but I am talking to the team of people there and finding out the issues that are being discussed. We have a 'no carbon tax' petition at the front of our site. I just spoke to the member of my staff who is managing the process who said, 'I can't believe the anger in the people that are coming up to sign this petition, and by the end of our three days here we will have hundreds of pages.' To be honest, I did not expect that response. I thought that people wandering by to chat about the season or the conditions or the mice and rabbits or the fact that we need another five to 10 millimetres of rain would probably see the carbon tax petition and say, 'Okay, sure, I'll sign it.' In fact, that is not the case. They are queuing up to sign it. This is the petition that says that the Australian people should have their say on whether we have a carbon tax.

The answer was that they are just not sexy or particularly interesting. The government has given $20 million to camel control, and I think it is too wet to actually carry that out, but $1.2 million to rabbit control. It is just not enough. Now is the time to begin the search for the next biological control for the rabbit. It really is getting too late.
                                                                                                                 </p>

But because the rabbit populations are building up so much in the far west following recent good rain, it is obvious that those controls are no longer working. We need science, we need applied research and we need a laboratory to make this happen. There is not the ability in the wide-open station country of the far west to go out and rip rabbit burrows, which is what a lot of us who have been farmers in the past have done, and physically fill in rabbit burrows. Putting Phostoxin tablets down and shovelling them over was a painstaking task, but often the only way you could get rid of rabbits.

Unfortunately, we have seen the shutting down of baiting stations during the middle of a mice plague. I think this is symptomatic of our current agriculture minister's inability to get on the front foot with this stuff. I know there is an arms-length process that goes through the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and I understand that process well because I was the parliamentary secretary responsible for the authority. They do a good job, but they are moving at glacial pace. They are looking at possibly extending permits and gathering information and talking to a national mouse management working group. I want to bring the frustration of farmers to the attention of this place. Farmers see this process that is happening but they just want to get hold of mouse bait and store it on farm ready for when mouse numbers increase. Unfortunately, what they are doing is mixing their own brews at home, using chemicals that probably are not allowed to be used in the way that they are using them. I am not condoning that of course, but when mouse bait is not available they may use unorthodox approaches. Anyone who has lived through a mouse plague in rural Australia knows there is nothing funny about it. I can tell you that it sends people crazy if they get in the house. It literally destroys and devastates crops. I urge the minister to step in and take action.

A 2009 report from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research said that the number of women in manual trades was probably less than two per cent. This number is too low but it is something that can be fixed. Women have done these trades before. During World War I and

Training in trades and skills is an important component for the future productivity, employment and economic growth of this country. I have had a long interest in vocational education and trades since my days at the oldest workers college in the world, my former alma mater and the place where I was union president, the

So I was very pleased when the Gillard government invested heavily in trades, training and education in the budget. The budget invested over $100 million to help mentor apprentices through their training. Currently, only 48 per cent of apprentices complete their training, and it is particularly difficult in the first year. This program is aimed at providing the right guidance and mentoring to young apprentices to make sure they understand and can benefit from the opportunities of learning a trade. The budget also included $281 million for a support package for additional tax-free payments to encourage apprentices in critical trades and a $1,700 bonus, which is expected to support 200,000 apprentices over four years.

                                                                                                                   The Gillard government invested $11 billion in vocational training between 2008 and 2010, and this has resulted in 448,000 new apprentices—a significant number and the highest ever recorded. These investments are coupled with the billion-dollar investment already made in the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program to ensure that as many Australian school students as possible have the opportunity to learn a skill or a trade. In my own electorate, I know how much these centres are appreciated. I have met the students and staff of St Mary MacKillop College in Tuggeranong who told me just how much their centre is helping to change lives and create opportunities. I had a tour of this new centre just recently. It has not opened yet as work is still being done on it. It has all sorts of woodwork and metal-craft opportunities and has a centre for hospitality. These new centres provide young Australians with a range of trade skills as well as life skills, and they are to be lauded. We have made a significant investment of $5.7 million in the centre at St Mary MacKillop College, and it benefits not just the hundreds of students at that college but also students throughout Canberra—students from

I mention these key programs not only because I am proud of the achievements of the Gillard government when it comes to skills and education but because I want to encourage all women and girls to take up the opportunity that this record level of investment is unlocking. I think it is important to note that this is a program that those opposite would slash and burn should they come to office, depriving thousands of Australians the opportunity of learning a trade, including the next generation of girls and women such as those who were honoured at the recent awards event I went to.

The sorts of things I do include getting salvinia and water hyacinth removed from creeks that have clogged up. I have birds that fly between Australia and Russia on a seasonal basis monitored. I want to see the mouth of a river that is slowly silting up reopened properly by the closure of a secondary mouth. I do things like that. So I get offended when anyone who opposes the carbon tax is criticised, chastised and berated for supposedly being a climate change denier. We are howled down, ignored and ridiculed for holding different opinions from the architects of the carbon tax, who—might I say with great piety—say that they want the debate based on the facts. Well, they do not base their arguments on the facts.

My constituent was most upset to receive this letter—they have never been Greens supporters—and they did not understand why they had been targeted by the party. I believe the letter was sent in error, as the text was clearly intended for distribution in

On page 1 of the letter she says that people have been fleeing Somalia because of climate change. I would suggest that a failed government and rampant violence is the reason most people are fleeing Somalia. While I acknowledge that there has been drought and famine, the failure of government to properly distribute food to those people has been a major factor.

That is when people are going to die, not because of what Senator Milne suggests with her rampant scaremongering. On every single page of this widely distributed letter there are pleas to donate money to the Greens so that they can build up a war chest of $100,000 by the end of the month. In a neat aside at the end of the letter, Senator Milne claims:

So I find this sort of thing, frightening people in my electorate, offensive. I say to the Greens: leave my people alone; you got one of your lowest votes in Australia in my electorate. My people can make good judgments, and they do not need to be scared by outrageous claims, and this is especially offensive when it is directed at older people.

We are much more than the sandwich filling. We are a fantastic region in our own right, boosted by our central location with businesses aspiring to really perform equal to any in any other location—and, God willing, with the NBN we will be able to get out and show a few of the big cities what we can really do when we get access to the same sort of resources. The awards showcase the strength, innovation, skill and enterprise that exists in our region.

Mr Hughes started his company in 1991 while he was working as a bouncer at the Kincumber Hotel, a place which is very close to where I live and is often a site of picking up a little bit for the weekend. So he has gone from being a Kincumber pub bouncer to now being the owner of a company that has grown to be a national market leader, mainly in the field of cleaning service provision, with a $20 million annual turnover and employing some 800 staff across Australia. It is a very impressive achievement and I was very encouraged that such incredible entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well on the Central Coast. Warren was very keen to acknowledge the significant role that his wife, Donna, played in his success. She was there to celebrate with him on the evening, as were members of his staff who have been with him since the beginning of his business. He has a very low attrition rate because he runs a fantastic locally based model and he encourages his staff and calls them his family members. They were delighted in the success and they shared in that success with him.
