        The Australian Bocce Championships for 2009 were held between 5 June and 8 June at the Campania Sport and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in the electorate of Makin, with support from the Molinara club located in the neighbouring Adelaide electorate. Bocce is one of the family of bowl sports. It has been played in Australia since the early 1900s and is particularly popular amongst the Italian community. Men and women bocce players from around Australia participated in the championships in what was a very well organised and successful event. National Australian bocce championships have been held in Australia since 1970 on a rotational basis between each of the states. From the Australian championships, players are selected to represent Australia in the world championships.

        I attended both the opening and closing stages of the championships in Adelaide and I was very impressed with the effort that went into organising the four-day event and the number of volunteers who contributed towards the successful championship. It was also wonderful to see the genuine camaraderie between the bocce players who took part in the event, including the officials. I especially acknowledge the efforts of Marco Quaglia, President of the Compania club; Silvio Varricchio, President of the South Australian Bocce Federation; Mirella Mancini

        , Secretary of the South Australian Bocce Federation; and Raymond Cher, President of the Bocce Federation of Australia. I acknowledge their tireless work to make the championships a success and I wish all the Australian competitors well in the world men’s championships being held in France between 28 September and 4 October. I also wish the International Bocce Federation success in having the bowl sport included in future
