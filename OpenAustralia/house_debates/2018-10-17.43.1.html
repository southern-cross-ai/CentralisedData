        I rise to pay tribute to and acknowledge the 60 years of remarkable service by Mrs Jean Harrop to the Queensland Country Women's Association. Jean first joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        in 1958 at Inala. While she was there, she served as vice president and president a number of times, as well as secretary and treasurer. She moved to Oxley when the Inala branch closed in 1972, with eight other members, and she has been an active member of the Oxley branch for the past 46 years.

        Jean's biggest passion is, perhaps, music. Jean was the division music and drama chairman from 1989 to 1992, and she was one of the organisers of the very entertaining M&amp;D—music and drama—festivals for many years. At various times she held the role of treasurer of the division committee. At

        state level she was well known for her contribution to the organisation of the music and drama cultural committee, serving as chairman, secretary or treasurer for a number of years. She and Mary Martyn often travelled to country divisions using a cultural grant to promote dramatic and musical activities in workshops using short plays and verse speaking as well as solo, duet and small choir singing.

        During her leadership, the Oxley branch has become well known for its Cent Auctions, which provide a popular social activity for the Oxley community, including a trivia night coming up this weekend. In the past, Jean has been awarded badges for 25 years of service, 50 years of service and, of course, most recently her 60 years badge. Thank you, Jean, for your many years of service to QCWA and our local community.
