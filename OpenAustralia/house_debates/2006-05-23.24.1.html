         First, I thank the honourable member for his question. The government remains concerned about the situation in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         . There was a brief respite from the unrest following the conclusion of the congress of the ruling party, Fretilin, between 17 and 19 May. But reports that we got yesterday and that we have been getting today are that parts of Dili and other parts of the country are descending into violence, and there are reports of injury and property damage. There is a report that an Australian journalist with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
          SBS
         </a>
         has been caught up in this violence, and our ambassador and embassy are doing what they can to evacuate him from the area of concern. This resurgence of violence underscores the importance of the independent commission which has been established by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
          East Timorese
         </a>
         government to investigate the grievances of the 595 dismissed soldiers. We would urge that the commission conclude its work quickly as a first step to the resolution of the current crisis, though there are other underlying issues behind the crisis. We encourage all parties to resolve their differences in a manner consistent with the rule of law, with democracy and with international norms of human rights. Rebel military and security personnel must cease destabilising the situation and work with the government to resolve their differences.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have remained in close contact with my East Timorese counterpart,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Ramos_Horta" rel="nofollow">
          Jose Ramos Horta
         </a>
         , and obviously with our ambassador and staff in Dili. We have made it clear that we are ready to offer assistance to East Timor if needed and if requested by the East Timorese government directly or indirectly through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         . As I think the House is aware, we have prepositioned some military assets in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         , including naval vessels, aircraft and even some troops, to enable a rapid response to assist with evacuation or some other form of assistance if it is required.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will conclude by saying that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         advises Australians to reconsider plans to travel to East Timor at this time because of the ongoing violence and the potential for further violence and advises Australians in East Timor who are concerned about their safety to consider departing. East Timor is a young country and, being a young country, it is inevitably coming to terms with the responsibilities of democracy and government. I hope that this difficult situation can be resolved quickly and, obviously, peacefully. Australia stands willing and ready to help to bring about a return to stability if that help is needed at any time.
