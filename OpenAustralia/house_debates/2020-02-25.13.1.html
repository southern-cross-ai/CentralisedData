       <p>
        'Unemployment'—it's a phrase that is often thrown around in this place when we are discussing the budget and the stagnant economy. We use it, and associated figures, as throwaway lines so frequently that I'm afraid people forget the real-world implications of unemployment. Unemployment can ruin lives, tear families apart and force people to go hungry. We should be conscious of this every time we discuss unemployment figures in this place. Recently we've had the Commonwealth unemployment figures released. Unfortunately, whilst we know that unemployment is rising, the figures in south-west Sydney are much worse. It is estimated that unemployment in south-west Sydney is 6.1 per cent, significantly above the national average, and underemployment, at an estimated 12.9 per cent, is terrible—and it's worse for those aged below 24.

        The families of Macarthur cannot handle much more in terms of financial burdens. Families are struggling to make ends meet. The cost of living is far too high and wages growth is stagnant. Australians need a pay rise. We need improvements in our employment. People cannot find enough work. Mass casualisation in the workforce is forcing members of my community to work more than one job. In doing so, they forgo spending time with their loved ones just to stay afloat. This is a national shame. The Macarthur community is in desperate need of jobs. With unprecedented levels of mortgage stress in south-west Sydney, we are in desperate need of local jobs.
