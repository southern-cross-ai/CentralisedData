        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. On 12 September last year, Australia's terror alert level was raised to its highest level in our history. What protocols were changed in ministerial offices, including the Attorney-General's office, as a result of the terror alert level being raised?

         I understand where the former Attorney-General is heading with this question. His actions today in questioning the Attorney-General over procedures in the Attorney-General's office is contemptible. For the Attorney-General to seek to make political mileage out of a national tragedy is reprehensible. The former Attorney-General well knows that the procedure related to the handling of a letter received from Mr Monis is exactly the same procedure as occurred under this Attorney-General's time in that office. I find it extraordinary. This former Attorney-General's record on national security was so weak, where we saw our security agencies' resources and our intelligence agencies' resources degraded under the former Labor government. Absolutely appalling.

          <p>
           We have seen the line of questioning in Senate estimates today about protocols in the Attorney-General's Department. What the Attorney-General under the Labor government, the now member for Isaacs, has failed to point out is that letters were received from this gentleman by the former Attorney-General himself, by former Labor ministers, by former Prime Minister Gillard, by the former Attorney-General McLelland. For this former Attorney-General to seek to question protocols in the Attorney-General's Department that he well knows were in place when he was there, and he received a letter from Mr Monis, is beneath contempt. While the member for Isaacs and the Labor Party were very weak on national security, I did not ever expect them to go so low as to attack the Attorney-General for protocols in the Attorney-General's Department that he well knew were in place when the former Labor government was there.

             And an attempt to politicise a national tragedy should never occur in this place, not under the former Attorney-General, and certainly we are deeply concerned with Labor's line of questioning that seeks to question protocols that he well knew existed.
