       <p>
        I recently had the very powerful experience of driving from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        to the mouth of the Murray, 3½ thousand kilometres through the Murray-Darling Basin. On the way I met with farmers and irrigators, people from the street, environmental groups and those concerned with the health of this magnificent area, but in no place was I more affected than at Yelta Fresh Vineyards in Mildura. In particular, I visited the home of Darren and Christine Argiro. What they said to me was very powerful, and I will quote from Christine’s subsequent follow-up letter:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am the fourth generation here in the Sunraysia area. I am married and with my husband we run 100 acres of table grapes and winery. Our future looked very bright for our four children and ourselves until the drought hit or the mismanagement of the Murray to be more to the point.
       </p>
       <p>
        What she told me was very simple. Her family was desperate, small block farmers were desperate, and I promised to Christine that I would not forget and that I would take her issue up.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we have just done today is to give the federal government an opportunity and no excuses to make sure that they help farmers such as Christine with direct funding for assisting with water efficiency. Six-hundred billion litres of water savings are available to be shared between the Murray and the farmers if, finally, the $5.8 billion of rural re-plumbing money is unfrozen by Senator Wong. That money is vital to farming families such as Darren and Christine Argiro. If they can get that funding, if they can get the support, then their children will have an opportunity, and I made that pledge to Christine that we would fight for that money.
       </p>
       <p>
        As of today, with the passage of the federal water bill with our support, there is no excuse for the federal government to deny that money. Unfreeze the $5.8 billion, help re-plumb rural Australia, Senator Wong, and above all else give Christine Argiro and her husband, Darren, a future for their children.
