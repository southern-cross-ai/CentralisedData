        Last Wednesday, 7 June, I attended the Lions Club International's 100th anniversary celebration. It was organised by St George Lions, but it was great to also see Lugarno Lions and Oatley Lions there, and a whole range of other Lions clubs from the electorate. In Banks we have a particularly strong Lions community, with the annual Oatley Lions and Lugarno Lions spring festivals, which both raise tens of thousands of dollars for charity. Lions has been around for 100 years, and that does not happen by accident. It is an extraordinary organisation that has achieved an immense amount, right around the world, and it has achieved a great deal in my electorate. I would like to acknowledge Bryan Pirie, the president of Oatley Lions, who does so much for our community; Greg English from Lugarno Lions; and

        from St George Lions, who put on the event. Thank you to all the people who came from outside of our area to celebrate the 100th anniversary at Conca D'oro in Riverwood.

        On 8 June I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Christ Church
        </a>
        in Mortdale and met with the senior minister, Denis Oliver. Christ Church is a really important institution in the Mortdale area. Each year they run a particularly moving and impressive Anzac service which brings together our local community, with the local

        sub-branches, and many other local community groups participating. The church also runs the annual Carols in the Carpark event, which is always well attended, and does a lot of work with some of the less fortunate in our community. To Minister Denis Oliver and to everyone who is involved in Christ Church at Mortdale: thank you so much for all of your efforts.

        On 5 May I visited Panania North Public School P&amp;C, a really vibrant and active P&amp;C. It was good to speak to the school about a range of matters, including the need for enhanced sporting surfaces at the school. There is a particular need for the installation of synthetic turf, which will help the kids to train for various sporting events and so on, and lighting is an important part of that project as well. It was good to discuss those issues and to discuss with the P&amp;C the educational support provided by the federal government. I would like to thank Rachel McClelland, the P&amp;C president, and also Chada Zoabi, the treasurer, for inviting me along. It was great to visit again, and I look forward to working closely with the Panania North P&amp;C in the months and years ahead.
