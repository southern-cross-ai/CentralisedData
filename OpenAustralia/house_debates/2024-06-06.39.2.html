       <p>
        Age is just a number, and the Mackay over-50s-and-better group do not let things like age get in their way. I had the pleasure of attending their 30th birthday celebration recentlyâ€”and not one of them forgot who I was!
       </p>
       <p>
        Jokes aside, I congratulate Janet, Margaret and the social committees on their efforts in ensuring those who are in their later years of their lives have events to look forward to. They have physical and social activities which include exercise programs, health talks, craft activities, theatre groups and card games. Most important are the information technology sessions available to them, to stay connected with their family and friends. Groups like Mackay over-50s-and-better might seem simple from the outside, but the work they do to ensure the vulnerable older members of our community don't experience social isolation is invaluable. They always celebrate in style, with dress-up events and decorations to make every event a fantastic get-together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had a fantastic time at the celebrations with the over 150 attendees. The food was delicious, the conversations were robust and the entertainment was second to none. Happy birthday, and I look forward to attending many more of your birthday events. Congratulations, and keep up the good work.
