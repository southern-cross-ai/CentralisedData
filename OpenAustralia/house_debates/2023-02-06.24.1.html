       <p>
        Access to high-quality, affordable and sustainable early learning services is important for many families—especially in electorates like Fowler where we have a significant disadvantage, and more so now with the cost-of-living crisis. However, the government must also address the workforce shortage, which the sector has been crying out for. I'm moving this motion to provide some urgently needed practical solutions following my consultations with childcare providers in my electorate of Fowler. It aims to address the demand for childcare services the bill will create and the current workforce shortage, and to better meet the needs of workers, children and parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Fowler there's a higher percentage of children from culturally and linguistically diverse and refugee backgrounds—an indicator there are special needs and would require additional support, in particular for low-income families. Development vulnerability needs to be addressed early, as it becomes more expensive later. There's so much at stake socially and financially if we continue to get this wrong, and so much to gain if we get it right.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with Kindikids Edensor Park, KidsMatter and 3 Bears Childcare at Cabramatta, Growth Mindset at Bonnyrigg and Kids World Kindy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossley_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bossley Park
        </a>
        , and thanked them for their valuable time sharing their experiences with me and their commitment to the families of Fowler. The feedback was unanimous in the forum. Burnout is huge in the sector. There are staff shortages across the board. There is a huge increase in children with diverse and special needs, and there is not sufficient government support to cater for this growing need.
       </p>
       <p>
        As legislators we must transform how the childcare sector is viewed and valued by inspiring young people to be part of the sector and offering important opportunities for upskilling and better conditions to encourage people to stay for the long term. Workers in the field say they are often thought of as just glorified babysitters. I want them to know that they are not, because they play an important role in caring, nurturing and teaching our young Australians. We entrust our children in their care, and, as a government, we need to ensure there is legislation and policy to better support the sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I propose solutions to increase the number of early childcare teachers in the system and ease the shortage such as: simplifying the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        staffing ratio to be equivalent to the national quality framework; simplifying the early learning cadetship training model so that candidates can upskill to an early childhood teacher and study at the same time, or have their level of experience be taken into account if they want to become an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECT" rel="nofollow">
         ECT
        </a>
        ; and removing the need for university students already working in childcare facilities to do their practical course at another provider, as these demands are removing a valuable workforce from the current employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've also been told there needs to be additional funding for the inclusion development fund subsidy to help support the inclusion of the growing number of children with diverse and additional needs. Providers with over 15 years experience have told me that the increase in children with diverse and additional needs is unprecedented, especially in my electorate of Fowler.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current funding model is not working. The process to apply for inclusion of support workers is burdensome and there are out-of-pocket costs for the providers, with many centres stressing they cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs. These centres are not immune to the cost-of-living crisis. Currently the government funds the service $25 an hour in order to hire an inclusion support worker, but the true cost for this additional staff member, with superannuation, WorkCover and leave, is about $35 an hour. This additional staff member is crucial to ensure children's needs are met.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a recipe for disaster for all involved. There are children and families who need additional support but cannot access a service provider. Sometimes the focus on special needs often means other children miss out on required attention, placing huge burdens on teachers. I recommend that the government cover all employee costs of inclusion support services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, families in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        are missing out on crucial subsidies, due to the childcare subsidy application process. The process must be simplified to ensure families where English is a second language are not missing out on this much-needed subsidy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the government to seriously consider the practical solutions I've put forward in this motion that will immensely support the childcare sector, children and families like those in my community of Fowler.

          <p>
           It seems as though after nearly a decade of neglect and inaction the opposition, many of which made up the former government, have suddenly decided to care about child care. Quality child care is a vital part of a young person's development, and it is the Labor Party who knows this, and it is the government who cares about education and child care.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, that's right: we care about child care so much that we're actually going to do something to fix the issues that were ignored by the previous government. I know that this may be foreign to those opposite, but the concept is quite simple: it's just the opposite of doing nothing and ignoring the issues that are right in front of you. I know that doing nothing is something that those opposite are well acquainted with, so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what the opposite is.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care" rel="nofollow">
            Child care
           </a>
           is vitally important, but in recent years it hasn't been affordable or accessible for many families. Research shows that many children who participate in quality preschool programs are more likely to arrive at school equipped with the social, cognitive and emotional skills they need to help them continue to learn. These skills don't just benefit children throughout primary school; they're skills they'll have for their whole lives. Higher levels of educational success, employment and social skills have all been linked to moderate levels of participation in quality early childhood education. These benefits should not be restricted to those few that can afford child care or the few that are lucky enough to be able to secure a place. The benefits don't stop there. More children in child care means more parents who are able to get back to work, which means more businesses with eased pressure on staffing shortages.
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, this motion will see a list of issues rattled off by those opposite as if it's the first time this has been brought to their attention. They do a really good job of pretending these issues didn't exist less than a year ago when they were in government. But, of course, we all know that these issues have existed for much longer than the past few months. Just ask any parent of a young child in my electorate and they will tell you how hard it was for them to get their children into child care and just how much it costs. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
            Upper Hunter
           </a>
           is one of the worst childcare deserts in Australia, with there being over five children waiting for a place in child care for every one place available. One in five is simply not good enough. That is four in five parents who cannot get back into the workforce sooner. That is one in five children with a head start on their journey of education. That's four in five children and families that are being left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
           But this government leaves no one behind, and that's why we introduced the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. Child care should be accessible, and it shouldn't only be for the ones that can afford it. That's exactly what this bill is going to make a reality. Because of this bill, 6,300 families in the Hunter will be better off, 6,300 more families will be able to access child care, and 6,300 more families will be able to afford child care without having to sacrifice something else in their life to make sure their children have the best start to their life. This bill will ensure that 6,300 more parents will be able to get back to work. That's 6,300 more employers with additional staff. Most importantly: because of this government's bill, 6,300 more children in the Hunter will have access to early childhood education, a head start in learning and a head start in developing both independence and vital social skills. This bill is good for children, good for parents and good for our country. It is a very welcome beacon of light in my electorate, which is crying out for more accessible child care right now.

           <p>
            I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Fowler. Despite the wonderful oratory we just heard from the member for Hunter, I make the point that this motion is actually about access to those who can provide child care, not just those seeking to access it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people may think that the electorates of Fowler and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
             North Sydney
            </a>
            have little in common, but we're more alike than not, especially when it comes to the issues of childcare affordability and availability. Like Fowler, and many other electorates across the country, North Sydney is a vibrant and diverse community, with 50 per cent of people living in the area having been born overseas and 30 per cent speaking a language other than English at home. Also, much like Fowler, families in North Sydney are suffering the knock-on effects of a severe shortage of early childhood care and education spots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research consistently shows the considerable economic benefits of spending on early childhood education and high-quality care—quite simply, the more families who can access early childhood education to help their child's development and enable parents to work as they wish, the better. But successive governments from both sides of the aisle, both federal and state, have failed to adequately monitor the needs of this sector. So we find ourselves requiring urgent and necessary reform.
           </p>
           <p>
            Childcare fees in North Sydney are the highest in the country and run substantially above the government benefit rates. In North Sydney, for families on an average household income, the net cost after current subsidies of placing one child in day care five days a week is about $23,000 per year, or nearly 20 per cent of their income. These costs are negatively impacting many. They're preventing parents—most often mothers—from working when they would like to; deterring families, in some instances, from having more children; placing an expensive burden on older members of the family as they step in to help with care; and, perhaps worst of all, leading to missed opportunities for children to benefit from early education.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, as is often the case, while those of us who sit in government may struggle to find ways forward, those in business or on the front line see opportunities for innovative ways to overcome hurdles. Today I stand to speak for those currently managing early childhood care and education facilities across my community to provide some insight into the challenges they have identified and, importantly, the possible solutions they see. I thank them in advance for their considered thoughts.
           </p>
           <p>
            A long day care centre in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove" rel="nofollow">
             Lane Cove
            </a>
            recently told my office that every service in our area—and many more that they were aware of—were suffering immensely with respect to the dire skills shortage. The shortage of educators is, in their words, 'absolutely frightening', and, as business owners, they've had to consider the operations of their business. But, as small-business owners often do, whilst they see the challenges presented, they also give significant thought to potential solutions. They identified that many of their childcare educators are on student visas, the conditions of which mean they must move interstate or to a regional area in order to extend their visa or improve their pathway to permanent residency. This required move disrupts not only the centre but also the local community, where those people contribute significantly. They suggested, then, that the government consider changing this visa requirement for early childhood carers and educators to remove this disruption of the workforce. It's a simple and obvious solution, but I wonder how difficult it would be for us to enact.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know we need at least 9,000 early educators to ensure services are able to accommodate the increasing demand for places for children. In this context, ensuring early educators are also paid appropriately for their skilled and valuable work is key. We must move to shore up the workforce by looking at temporary wage bonuses and addressing the 30 per cent wage disparity between early childhood educators and primary school teachers.

            Another locally run centre highlighted the fee differentials between profit, not-for-profit and family run centres as a key concern. They suggested this could be addressed through reforms, including making child care tax deductible for working families at a certain level of combined income and then redirecting government funding to those most in need. These are just a few of the ideas they've come up with. The opportunity for us, as legislators, is to listen to this frontline experience, acknowledge the strength of the observations and then move accordingly. I note that the government is hosting an early childhood education and care roundtable in coming weeks. My call to the government is to not just listen but to move expediently to act.

            Every child has a right to education. Whether they are in North Sydney or Fowler or anywhere else should be irrelevant.

            <p>
             I got to hang out with a bunch of four- and five-year-olds just before Christmas at the graduation of students from the Euroka Children's Centre, a not-for-profit community based long day care centre in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountain" rel="nofollow">

             that's been operating since 1985. We were outside in their play area, which we as a government have committed $20,000 to, to help with improvements in the play space. Their plan is for things like slides, a rock wall and scramble nets.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's too easy to dismiss the idea of play areas as a secondary thing in education and as something that's simply a respite from learning, whereas some of the most important lessons young children can learn—and I would argue all children—happen in the playground. Learning to share, learning to take turns and learning to respond appropriately to social cues can mean the difference between an easier or harder journey as an adult, not to mention the physical skills development that occurs, the managing of fear and excitement and 1,001 other emotions and skills. So it's no surprise to me that parents who have watched their children develop under the care of the Euroka team cheered to know that even though their children might not benefit, future kids would. Their biggest applause was when I mentioned the Albanese government's commitment to making early childhood education and care more affordable for families.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank the member for Fowler for raising this important issue, which is a game changer for families and for our economy. We know our landmark reforms are only possible if we retain, recruit and train a high-quality workforce, and we have a plan to do exactly that.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want early childhood educators in my electorate of Macquarie, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             and the Hawkesbury, to know that I appreciate the pressures that you're facing and your workload, and that we, as a government, value the vital role you play, which can shape a child's future. Our plan to support early educators, the directors of preschools and long day care centres and the parents who rely on them begins with recognition of the professionalisation of this workforce, recognition that they are educators not childminders, recognition that they are highly trained experts, recognition of the need for significant career pathways and recognition that all these things have been ignored by a decade of neglect and inaction from previous Liberal governments.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know changes are needed. We've committed to working with early educators, the sector and unions to overcome long-term issues like the persistent challenges to attract and retain staff, and the huge gaps that mean people in regional areas, including mine, cannot access early childhood education and care when they need it or as much as they need it. Both the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains have been identified as having serious shortages of places.
            </p>
            <p>
             The contrast between our approach to these issues and that of the Liberals while in government is stark. They ignored, denied, minimised and did as little as possible to address the really pressing issues. By contrast, we take these issues seriously and look to have responses that mean we don't have to revisit the same issue every few years, because we aim for a longer-term, sustainable response.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tackling childcare costs is a fundamental way to reduce the cost-of-living pressures that families are facing. It will make early childhood education more affordable for 1.2 million families. Seventy-five per cent of those families earn less than $180,000 a year, and around 50 per cent earn less than $120,000 a year. The costs of child care for these families are a big chunk of their pay packet, and this will help. What's more, it means that people who couldn't look for work, because of the prohibitive costs of early childhood education and care, will now have more choices. Last year, 73,000 people who wanted to work didn't look, just for that reason. That means that, while this is about families with young children, it's also about the skills shortage and the local businesses in my community who can't find people to work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Attracting new workers to the early childhood sector is essential for all this to happen. We know that the shortages can't, in the short term, be filled through the domestic market, so we've looked to migration to help ease the shortages by expanding the migration program to 35,000 places and prioritising visa processing for qualified teachers, including early childhood teachers. In partnership with the states, we're delivering 180,000 fee-free

             and vocational places. That includes 10,000 places right now for early childhood studies in

             . That's a start, and we know there's more that we'll do.
