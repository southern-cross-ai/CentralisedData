        On 11 August I attended Step Studio in Hurstville, one of the most vibrant dance studios anywhere in the St George region in Sydney. It was great to catch up with Momo Zhang, the director, and hear more about the activities of Step Studio. There are more than 150 kids involved in this studio. On 28 September they held a performance in Hurstville showcasing the talent of the students, whether it be in jazz, Chinese classical dance, ballet, hip-hop or a whole range of other dance types. There are classes for students as young as two right up to adults. To Momo and Bobo Zhang, the other director, thank you for everything you do in our community.

        Oatley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC" rel="nofollow">
         FC
        </a>
        one of the most vibrant football clubs in my electorate. It has grown remarkably in recent years and now has more than 850 players. It has been incredibly well led by Belinda Stanton, who is an absolute dynamo and has grown this club with fierce determination. One-third of the players in Oatley FC are female, which is a wonderful thing. That female proportion of the club has grown very substantially in recent times. I want to thank Belinda for all of her work. I also thank Jason Finlay, who was a very articulate and persistent advocate for the club, and all of the other members of the executive, who have done so well to grow Oatley to some 69 teams in 2022.

        Connells Point Netball Club is one of the largest netball clubs anywhere in the region. There are more than 250 players in Connells Point Netball Club. Julian Finch and Maureen Finch have been the real nucleus of this club for many years now. It was good to attend the recent presentation at Club Central Hurstville on 9 October. The club has had a very strong focus on growing female participation in sport not only in netball but more broadly. Recently they held a very successful women in sport function for that purpose. To Julian and Maureen Finch; and Sheree Smith, who does so much as treasurer: thank you for your work.

        Buddhist Temple in Kogarah is a tremendous part of our community. The temple was founded in 2000. Originally based in Hurstville, it was moved to Kogarah a few years ago. Abbess Man Ko is a remarkable leader for the temple and does tremendous work. I want to acknowledge her work and the work of Venerable Miao You, Venerable You Fa and Venerable Jeu Ning as well. Members of the temple are always in the community supporting people in aged-care centres and raising funds for important community projects. Thank you to everyone at Nan Tien for what you do.
