        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        —is a not-for-profit organisation that was incorporated in 1950. It originated from very humble beginnings, when a group of parents came together at the Women's and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Hospital
        </a>
        with a common objective of seeking support for their children who were living with disabilities. Today's SCOSA operates 13 client hubs spread across Adelaide and regional areas of South Australia, supporting hundreds of people living with disabilities, and also their families. Many of SCOSA's clients have cerebral palsy, while others also have acquired brain injuries, autism or some other form of disability. The programs and activities SCOSA provide include educational and recreational activities such as literacy, numeracy, cooking, computing, arts and craft, music, gardening and a variety of supporting activities. I had the pleasure of participating in one of these—a game of bocce—with some of the clients.

        One of SCOSA's new hubs is located at Plympton in the Hindmarsh electorate. It was a great joy and privilege to see the team of SCOSA in action recently and to see the positive difference they make for people living with disabilities. Congratulations to Kym and her seven staff at Plympton, who do a wonderful job caring for their 20 clients who visit that hub. It was made possible, this hub, by donations for around $160,000 from local companies and individuals, so it is great that a community gets together to support such a worthy facility as the SCOSA hub at Plympton.
