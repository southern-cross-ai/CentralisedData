        These are tough times, and for millions of Australians they continue to be tough times. We continue to see that while every single Australian has done their bit, be that staying home, avoiding trips, looking after people, there are some in our community who have gone truly above and beyond. With
        <i>
         Perth Voice
        </i>
        , my local paper, I launched the Perth Community Champions to recognise some of the people who really have gone out of their way in the toughest of times. The first I'd like to recognise is Neil Dwyer. Neil is the President of the Bedford Bowling Club in my electorate. He has continued, if not amplified, the social life of the club during the last few months. He's in the vulnerable category himself, but he still manages to get himself to the club on the bus—and thank you to our Transperth bus drivers for continuing their work in very difficult circumstances a few months ago. Neil has continued to coordinate members, keeping them feeling included, reaching out to vulnerable members of the Bedford Bowling Club, building the plan to restore the club to full activity as soon as possible—I understand they have just started to open up again—and also helping people who haven't had internet access to stay in touch at times of isolation.
