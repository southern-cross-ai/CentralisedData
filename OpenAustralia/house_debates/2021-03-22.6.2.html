       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a pleasure to introduce this bill to the House ahead of the next federal budget next sitting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just like last year, I'll be reviewing those budget papers carefully to assess exactly what this government has committed for my electorate and for regional Australians at large.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to what the government might think, regional Australians aren't won over by glossy budget papers and keynote speeches with lots of hot air and no substance.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia
        </a>
        ns want true investment in their potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're looking for governments with long-term plans backed by evidence of community need, not just announcements where nothing materialises.
       </p>
       <p>
        They want to know that those of us who are fortunate enough to represent them in this place care about their region's future, not their own political future at the next election.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill does two things. First, it requires the Treasurer to publicly release and table a rural and regional Australia statement alongside every federal budget and Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook report.
       </p>
       <p>
        That statement must demonstrate that the government of the day is serious about supporting regional Australia, clearly setting out how government initiatives will directly benefit local economies, build the right infrastructure and boost social cohesion in the regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill is not about motherhood statements; it's about robust and reliable data that shows real community need and real impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I've made sure that this bill would require the government to prove the benefits of its initiatives that they're bringing to the regions with robust and reliable data—data that shows that individual programs are securing a return on investment and that regional Australia is improving against objective economic and social indicators over time, how government initiatives are influencing mortality and morbidity rates, whether the government is really meeting its vision of an agricultural sector which exceeds $100 billion farmgate output by 2030 and whether it's truly value for money, and data from the National Skills Commissioner on educational attainment and skills gaps.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no one place for us to see and track progress and return on investment in regional Australia at large and compare our progress year by year.
       </p>
       <p>
        That begs the question: how will we ever get there if we don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going?
       </p>
       <p>
        The second thing this bill does is require the government to develop and release a national white paper for rural and regional Australia within 24 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        That white paper must be aspirational, bipartisan, deeply consultative and long term.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's easy for this and any government to simply say it's getting behind regional Australia. Well, the truth is that any politician can say that.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it's another thing altogether to put pen to paper and set out a vision for regional Australia and, importantly, a time line to get us there—regions with fast, reliable and affordable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        , free from mobile phone blackspots.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm talking about world-class public transport to metro areas and educational facilities that keep kids in the regions and not off to the cities after high school—educational facilities that bring kids from the cities into the regions—and regions with high-quality health care and mental health services, affordable and abundant housing and thriving economies that draw in city folk.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's the kind of vision that regional Australians want from this government, and they want a clear road map to get them there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recommendation 13 of the
        <i>
         Regions at the

        <i>
         eady
        </i>
        report published by the Regional Australia Committee last parliament called on the government to initiate a white paper process for regional Australia as a matter of urgency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has sat on that report for over two years now and has refused to do anything at all about that recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, I waited for so long for action on that report that I had to work with Senate crossbench colleagues to pry the government's response to the report out of its hands through an order for the production of documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        And even then, we've heard crickets—nothing from the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        All those public hearings, all those submissions, all that good intention of people coming to the committee—for what?
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional Australians don't want another committee report recommending another go on the consultation and inquiry merry-go-round. They want action, and they want it now.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill gives voice to regional Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        A government that supports this bill is one than embraces transparency and accountability.
       </p>
       <p>
        A government that supports this bill is one that truly is committed to unleashing the potential pent up in our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll be watching the government's budget announcements for regional Australia and my electorate in May as I always do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll also be watching how the government responds to this bill, which would usher in greater transparency, data-driven decision-making and a real long-term vision for regional Australia—not just quick wins in budget line items.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House and I cede the rest of my time for my member for Mayo.

          </a>
          Statements) Bill 2021, introduced by the member for Indi, is incredibly significant, and I'm really disappointed that we don't have any National Party MPs in this place to hear about this bill. They say that they're fighting for regional Australia, and this is a bill that will very much support regional Australia because of its transparency.
         </p>
         <p>
          Regional Australia is a significant contributor to the Australian economy, accounting for approximately 40 per cent of our national economic output and employing approximately one-third of Australia's workforce. I believe that it's regional Australia that's holding up the nation. The traditional perspective of regional Australia often reflects a somewhat narrow view limited to just agriculture and mining. While these industries are critical—and they certainly are critical in my electorate—and while they make up a major proportion of the economic outputs in the regions, our regions are becoming more and more diverse, and I believe that many of the decisions in this place are very much east coast city centric. In my beautiful electorate of Mayo, our top five sectors are agriculture, forestry and fishing, construction, real estate services, and professional scientific and technical services. Employment in high-value services is increasing. And it's not just restricted to my electorate; many people, because of telecommunication advancements, are able to work in the regions. However, while there is increasing diversity in economic opportunity, there are great challenges in the regions with respect to access to affordable health. Certainly, in parts of my electorate you're incredibly fortunate if you actually get a doctor's appointment, and in other parts pensioners can't get bulk-billed. It is very, very difficult.
         </p>
         <p>
          The requirement for the Treasurer to publicly release and table a regional statement together with each budget and economic and fiscal outlook report is long overdue. Every single time we spend money in this place, we should be detailing to the Australian community exactly how that money will support regional Australia and its impact on regional Australia. A statement that requires an assessment of the impact of government decisions and initiatives on the economic, social and cultural environmental impacts in regional Australia is also long overdue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let's talk about education. It is incredibly difficult for young people in the regions to get to university, and that's why we sought legislation in this place last year. That was very difficult, but it was about changing the statistics, which show that regional young people are far less likely to gain qualifications post year 12 despite a desire to do so. It's the tyranny of distance. When you look at education, when you look at health, when you look at a whole range of factors—aged care is another policy issue where it is incredibly difficult in regional Australia, yet the policy is very much designed for a metro space. I think that we need to do much, much more at every budget line to consider the impacts on regional Australia of how we spend money in this place.
         </p>
         <p>
          I commend the member for Indi for this bill. Again, I'm incredibly disappointed there aren't members of the National Party here to listen to this. If you truly are for regional Australia, you will support the member for Indi in this challenge. Let's get this bill through the parliament.
