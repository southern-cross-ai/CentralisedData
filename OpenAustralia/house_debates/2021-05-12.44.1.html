        The red and yellow striped flag has not been the official flag of Vietnam since 1975, but it is a flag which is still deeply honoured and respected in Australia. It is a flag which for many represents freedom and democracy. It's a flag which Australians fought beside. It's a flag which is incorporated in both the Australian and the United States Vietnam service medal. It's a flag recognised by many local governments, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_City" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which recognises it as a heritage flag. We honour that flag when we gather at Tet and other Vietnamese celebrations.

        Recently, that flag has been desecrated in acts of violence. It has been torn down. I've seen videos of it being trodden and stamped upon. This is despicable. I'm also aware that senior Vietnamese leaders have received threats because of their support for the flag of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">
         South Vietnam
        </a>
        . We stand with the Vietnamese leaders, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nguyen" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . These leaders do not deserve to be dragged through to threats and intimidation. The flag is one which does represent democracy. It's one that Australians fought beside and that many Vietnamese died under. It is one that represents much that is good in terms of democracy and freedom. I'm glad the member for Blaxland is here. He represents so many Australians of Vietnamese heritage who honour that flag. Any acts of violence should be deplored. I call on the

        police and, if this was done by a temporary visa holder, the Australian federal government to take this matter with due seriousness.
