       <p>
        It is my duty to make a statement to the House concerning a Senate amendment with respect to this bill and the matter of constitutional principle it raises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Proposed Senate amendment No. 3 is expected, if enacted, to have the effect of increasing payments to suppliers of pharmaceutical products. That is, it is expected to have the effect of increasing expenditure under the standing appropriation in the principal Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is doubt that the Senate may proceed in these circumstances by way of amendment because of section 53 of the Constitution. Among other things, this section prohibits the Senate from amending a bill so as to increase ‘any proposed charge or burden on the people’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The view has been taken that where expenditure is appropriated in these circumstances, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation must be recommended by a message from the Governor-General. I understand that such a message has been obtained in this case.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The House will need to consider the way in which it should proceed to deal with the matters raised in Senate amendment No. 3. If it wishes to entertain the proposal reflected in the amendment, it may choose to proceed by alternative means.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The matter for consideration is not so much one of the privileges and rights between the two Houses but observance of the requirements of the Constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by Message No. 554 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the National Health Amendment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        Question agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I indicate to the House that the government proposes that Senate amendments (1) and (2) and (4) to (10) be agreed to, and that amendment (3) be disagreed to but that an amendment be made in place there-of. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments (1) and (2) and (4) to (10) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendment (3). I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">

         The Minister for Ageing might be able to assist in this process. My understanding is that the amendments that were moved in the Senate will be moved here. I understand that, with the constitutional restrictions, an identical alternative amendment will be moved. The minister might be able to explain whether that is his understanding of the pro-cess that is going to be followed. Clearly, the amendment that was moved, with the support of the government and Labor, in the other place is an agreed position between the government and the opposition, and with the minor parties as well, as a result of the Senate committee process. It was my understanding that that amendment would be moved here as well. Certainly, I am happy to speak on the others. I understand that it is more about the technical nature of what can be moved in the Senate compared to what can be moved in the House, rather than any opposition to the content of the amendment. Could the minister clarify whether that is the government’s intention before I make some short comments.

          I do not propose to get into a debate about this. Obviously, I am not the minister responsible for the

           Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
          </a>
          . My understanding is that the minor parties’ amendment is being disagreed to by the government, but we are enacting our own amendment this morning which is virtually in the same detail as the Senate amendment, which I understand has been agreed to by the opposition and the government. So we are disagreeing to their Senate amendment (3) but substituting our own government amendment.

          <p>
           Thank you for that clarification. That was my understanding as well, but I thought it was important that we have that on the record. Labor does support the passage of the
           <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2801" rel="nofollow">
            National Health Amendment (
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
            </a>
            ) Bill 2007
           </a>
           and the amendments that have been passed in the other place. We are disappointed that a number of the issues that were raised during a fairly truncated Senate committee process have not been able to be explored adequately. When such major changes are being made to the PBS—a very important part of the health support that the government gives to the nation—we need to make sure that we get the detail of these changes right. We are pleased, given our concerns about some of the issues that have been raised both on behalf of consumers and on behalf of the generics industry, that a number of the changes that have been accepted during the Senate process will at least allow for a proper and adequate review of whether these measures do have the intended effect.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think everybody is in furious agreement about the intended effect. Whether or not there might be some extra impact or burden on consumers—we have some fears that it may—will now at least be able to be properly monitored and reported on at the end of a review process. The government has agreed, following the Senate inquiry, to include that provision in this legislation. We welcome that and believe that it will be of benefit to consumers and that it will provide some extra protection and confidence which were not really able to be provided to the broader community during the very quick Senate inquiry process.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are also pleased that a number of the amendments will ensure that the departmental processes for implementing these reforms will be made more transparent. Other players in the pharmaceuticals industry will understand that, with respect to negotiations which are quite rightly held between the department, Medicines Australia and other pharmaceutical companies, there will be an extra level of scrutiny of those negotiations so that we can maintain the community’s confidence that this scheme is getting the best value for government and also protecting the needs and interests of consumers. I welcome the fact that these amendments have been agreed to, and I commend them to the House.
          </p>
