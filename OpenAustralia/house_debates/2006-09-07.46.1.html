        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what is the current level of the

         I thank the member for Bass for his question and I note that the last two questions asked of me were from members who fought off the depredations of the destructive employment policies of the Labor Party in Northern Tasmania at the time of the last election. But let me go to the substance of the question asked by the member for Bass. The government has decided that an infantry company, which comprises about 120 soldiers currently based in Darwin, will be sent to Dili immediately to reinforce the combat capability of the ADF contingent in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         There are currently approximately 930 ADF personnel in East Timor and about 180 members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         . Over the next week some 130 ADF logisticians, medical personnel and support staff will be withdrawn, their roles being substantially taken over by commercial contractors. In recent weeks the level of violence has fallen in Dili, thanks largely to excellent work by the Defence Force, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and other international forces. But there is no doubt that the escape of dissident FDTL officer Reinado and 56 other hardened criminals has escalated tensions. As the foreign minister said in this place on Tuesday, Australia is willing to help, along with other members of the international community.
        </p>
        <p>
         I repeat the message to the government and people of East Timor that, whilst the government and the people of that country have a willing friend and ally in Australia, they nonetheless carry direct responsibilities for looking to their own interests. The future of that country ultimately rests in the hands of the people of East Timor. The escape of Reinado was not the fault of the Australian military. The escape of Reinado was due to the negligence of others. It was not due to the negligence and the failure of the men and women of the Australian Federal Police or the men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         It is for the people of East Timor, having fought so hard for independence, not just to take responsibility for prison security but to resolve the broader issues that face that country. They must support the rule of law, they must uphold the democratic institutions of state, they must respect their fellow citizens and genuinely work towards resolution of their political differences. As they work towards that state and those goals they can rest assured that, providing they discharge their responsibilities, they will continue to have a faithful friend and constant ally in Australia.
