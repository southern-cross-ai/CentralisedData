        My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Does the minister agree with the draft national curriculum that controversy surrounds Australia’s war memorials and with the spokesman for the drafters of the curriculum that Gallipoli may have been unnecessarily glorified? Given the mess that the national curriculum has become, will he delay its introduction from January 2011 to January 2012 in order to get it right?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I would say, in answer to his question, firstly that the Australian curriculum will actually help students learn about the Anzac tradition, including Gallipoli, Anzac Day and other important events and symbols in Australian history.
        </p>
        <p>
         The matter that he refers to is actually the draft of the years 11 and 12 history curriculum and, as the shadow minister ought to know, there are already in place curriculum drafts, including those that deal with these matters for years 1 to 10. In fact, coming into the House I had a look at them and saw that the K-10 curriculum proposes that students consider the historical significance of an Australian war memorial, in year 2; Anzac Day, in year 3; and involvement in Gallipoli and the Anzac legend, in year 9.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact is that this is a draft curriculum that will go out for significant comment and consultation. It will come back to the ministers who consider these matters as a referral from the independent authority, ACARA—as you know—which is charged with doing this job. I would say to the shadow minister—

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question went to whether the curriculum would be ready by January 2011 and whether he would delay it till 2012. Clearly it won’t be. He should answer that question.

           There were two parts to the question. The minister in his response is being directly relevant to at least one of those parts.

            I am pointing out to those opposite that the shadow minister has a fundamental misunderstanding of the process for the development of the national curriculum, and it is quite evident in the question that you have asked. In relation to the first part of your question—

             <p>
              In relation to the first part of the shadow minister’s question, the fact is that all Australian governments are committed to the development and implementation of an Australian curriculum that runs all the way through from kindergarten to year 12, and it begins with English, maths, science and history. We will develop that curriculum on the basis of expert advice that is received by ministers to determine what should constitute that curriculum. In particular, as I said before I was interrupted by the shadow minister, students will learn about the contribution of Australian defence forces, about the Anzac tradition, about Anzac Day—about those important parts of our military history. That is an absolute given, from the point of view of the development of the national curriculum.
             </p>
             <p>
              In relation to the time line: as I have said before in this House, ministers have agreed a time line for the introduction of the national curriculum and that is what we commit to.
