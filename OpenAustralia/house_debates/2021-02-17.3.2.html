        1 TOURISM INDUSTRY: Resumption of debate (from 15 February 2021) on the motion of Mr Georganas—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) acknowledges the dire financial situation facing travel agents and the tourism industry in general as a result of Australia's current health and economic crisis;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) for many of our approximately 40,000 travel agents, the cost of staying open in order to reimburse customers who were forced to cancel holidays is contributing to significant losses; and

       <p class="italic">
        (d) with international travel restrictions likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future, travel agents need urgent assistance; and

        (3) calls on the Government to:

        (b) provide an urgent lifeline for travel agents on the brink of collapse, instead of the inadequate loss carry-back scheme, for which the vast majority of travel agents appear to be ineligible.
