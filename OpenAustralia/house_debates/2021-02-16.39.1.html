       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in his previous answer, contradicted Brittany Higgins' recollection that the Prime Minister's principal private secretary knew about the reported assault in 2019 by saying his office learned about this only in the last few weeks. The Prime Minister also claimed in his press conference that Ms Higgins's statements were confused. Previously the Prime Minister has said victims of sexual assault should be believed. Why doesn't that apply in this case?

         I can only inform the House of the information I have been advised of. The information I have been advised of is that my office became aware of the allegations of a sexual assault on 12 February 2021. That is my information. That is what I know to be the information as it has been provided to me based on what has occurred over these last 24 hours. I can only tell you what I know to be the case based on that information presented to me. I can't provide another set of information.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note the statement that has been issued today by Brittany Higgins, and I welcome that statement. That statement I think recognises the steps the government is taking, and I welcome the additional suggestions made today. I note that it concludes with this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I ask for my privacy to now be respected as I begin to emotionally recover from this difficult period and wish to make no further comment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will be complying with that request, and we will be seeking to pursue this matter through the mechanisms that I've already announced today and also potentially through the other mechanisms that have been suggested.
