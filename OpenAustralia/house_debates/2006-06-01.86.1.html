       <p>
        I rise this morning to acknowledge 12 state schools in the electorate of Bonner, each of which submitted outstanding applications under round 2 of the Investing in Our Schools Program. Just two days ago I was notified of the program’s successful applicants, and in the past 24 hours I have had the great pleasure of speaking to each school individually in relation to the grant that they worked so hard to achieve. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Hemmant State School, Lota State School, Mansfield State School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Mansfield State High School
        </a>
        , Mount Gravatt Special School, Mount Petrie State School, Murarrie State School, Rochedale State High School, Tingalpa State School, Upper Mount Gravatt State School, Wynnum North State School and the Queensland School for Travelling Show Children.

        Each of these school communities is extremely deserving of the support they have been shown by this government. From classroom refurbishments to covered walkways, library airconditioning and shade structures, each project will benefit the learning outcomes of students, and it is these students across the Southside and Bayside of the Bonner electorate that will ultimately benefit from these funding grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Investing in Our Schools Program has facilitated the opportunity for me to work closely with many of the school communities in Bonner. I have grown to know the principals and the students well and I remain thoroughly impressed with the high calibre of teaching staff across south-east Brisbane. After countless letters of support and visits to each of the schools, it is immensely rewarding to note that 21 of these state schools in the electorate have now received funding under the program. In this latest round, grants range from $37,415 for Mansfield State High School’s project to aircondition their library to $150,000 for Rochedale State High School’s shade structure and arts facility upgrade project. These are just two of the many worthwhile projects that have been specifically designed by each school for the benefit of their students.
       </p>
       <p>
        The response to these grants has been overwhelming and in many cases highly emotional. I know first-hand the difference that each of these projects will make in the school communities and I can confidently confirm once again that the Investing in Our Schools Program is bringing about positive change at the grassroots level.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principal" rel="nofollow">
         The Principal
        </a>
        of Wynnum North State School, Glenyce Hadfield, echoed the sentiments of many principals when she said, ‘This Investing in Our Schools grant has made my year.’ Ms Hadfield, along with all the local principals, works tirelessly for the school and its students. They, together with their P&amp;Cs, deserve congratulations on such a fine achievement. In the coming months each project will transform school facilities. I am really looking forward to witnessing these great improvements that will have been made possible by this government’s commitment to education through the Investing in Our Schools Program.
