        I rise today to recognise that last Saturday, 4 February, was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cancer_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Cancer Day
        </a>
        . I have the pleasure today of speaking about the efforts of one of my constituents in a national fundraising project for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cancer_Research_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Cancer Research Foundation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The effects of cancer are known to all of us. They are devastating to families and to the community. In the last couple of days we have had a condolence motion for Peter Veness, whose life was taken by cancer at a very young age. This brings home to us the effects cancer has on all of us. It weighs heavily also on our health system and it certainly does not discriminate. One in two Australians are now diagnosed with some form of cancer by the age of 85.
       </p>
       <p>
        My constituent Dee Handyside, who lives in Ormeau, is a proud breast cancer survivor. She emigrated from England to Australia in 2000 and was working as a ranger on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        when she was diagnosed in 2007. The disease had already claimed the life of her mother, and very quickly her sister and her cousin—both living in England—were also diagnosed.
       </p>
       <p>
        With family living so far away, Dee came to realise the importance of that most iconic trait that Australians cherish: mateship. During her time being treated for cancer, Dee composed and recorded an album,
        <i>
         Genetic
        </i>
        , in her spare room at home and in the hospital ward. She turned to genres ranging from motown, jazz, country and R&amp;B. She wrote about the low points, the high points and the cancer journey for other patients and sufferers. The final product is now being distributed for sale in ABC stores around the country. Ten per cent of the proceeds from sales will go to world-class cancer research through the ACRF as part of Dee's commitment to defeating this terrible disease for future generations. The album's release has already been featured on
        <i>
         Good Evening America
        </i>
        and on ABC Radio. One of the songs on the album is called
        <i>
         Thank You Friends
        </i>
        . It is a song filled with joy and warmth and it is dedicated to the many friends who helped Dee through her surgeries, treatments and other complications. In the song, Dee refers specifically to a group of breast cancer sufferers and survivors based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        who were brought together by an online support forum.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank my colleagues who are wearing this lapel badge today to proudly support the Australian Cancer Research Foundation and all the work that Dee and many others are doing.
