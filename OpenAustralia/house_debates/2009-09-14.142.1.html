        The

         Film and Television Institute
        </a>
        of WA, locally known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTI" rel="nofollow">
         FTI
        </a>
        , is a creative production and learning hub based in Fremantle that has helped foster talented filmmakers and community interest in this field of the arts since 1971. Its facilities and services include an animation studio, post-production facilities, a 120-seat theatre, an annual outdoor cinema program and accredited vocational education and training courses. The FTI’s director is Graeme Sward, a man who is passionate about the FTI and its place as one of Fremantle’s pre-eminent creative centres.

       <p>
        The organisation faces two major challenges, which I am committed to help resolve. The first challenge relates to the maintenance of the 19th century building that the FTI currently occupies, the heritage listed former Fremantle Boys School, which is owned by the state Department for Planning and Infrastructure. If urgent upgrade and repairs are not carried out, the FTI may be forced to leave the premises due to health and safety concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second challenge relates to being able to effectively connect to the rest of the filmmaking community. The organisation is just one example of why fast, affordable, high-bandwidth broadband is needed across Australia. I note that this was previously highlighted as a major issue for the film industry in a 2004 report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications,

        and Television Institute of WA, located in Fremantle, plays an important role in WA’s film and television industry. I will continue working to ensure it receives the government support it needs and deserves.
