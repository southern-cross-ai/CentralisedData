       <p>
        I've spoken many times in this place about a commitment I'm extremely proud of—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Medical School and Medical Research Institute. This is something that started in 2013 with a conversation about what it might look like to have a medical education and research institute in Gosford. From the very first conversation, and in the many others that followed, we developed a dream for our region—to have a world-class university in Gosford that reflected the needs, the hopes and the aspirations of our area. I was proud to secure an initial $45 million investment from this government and then to continue that with an additional $18 million commitment for stage 2 earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, the dream became a concrete reality with the official start of construction on the site—a really important moment for our region. This has not been an easy road, and every stakeholder in this project has had to give up something in order to contribute to where we are now. I pay special tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         University of Newcastle
        </a>
        , and particularly Professor John Aitken; and the Central Coast Local Health District. Their collaboration has helped to make this unique project tailored to our region's needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to officially welcome Professor Nick Goodwin to the Central Coast as the newly appointed Director of the Central Coast Research Institute. We set a goal for the project to be a locally focused but globally connected medical school and research institute, and with Professor Goodwin, a world-class specialist who has moved from Oxford in order to continue his career in Gosford, we are seeing something that not many believed could happen just a few short years ago. But it has happened, and this is another foundation stone laid down for a future of world-class excellence and opportunity for our region.
