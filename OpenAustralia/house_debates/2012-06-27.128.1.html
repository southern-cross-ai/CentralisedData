         Paul Fitzgerald
        </a>
        AM turns 90 years of age. Paul is a giant of a man, a distinguished artist, a generous benefactor and a thoroughly decent human being. No other living Australian artist has painted more notables and nobles than Paul Fitzgerald. His works include three portraits of the Queen, one of which was the only official portrait in the

       </p>
       <p>
        Paul's life is dotted with achievements which deserve to be retold. Born in Hawthorn, he was the second son of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_College" rel="nofollow">

        He had seven children—Fabian, Marisa, Patrick, Emma, Edward, Maria and Frances—and was fortunate to celebrate his 55th wedding anniversary to

       </p>
       <p>
        I have been fortunate to get to know Paul over recent years and came to appreciate his deeply held values and ideals. I am very proud of what he has achieved over the years in his professional life as well as his lifelong connection with my electorate of Kooyong. Paul's significant contribution to the art world and the Australian community deserves to be acknowledged and celebrated. His legacy and his works are bound to live on for many, many more years to come. I wish Paul and his family continued good health and joy, and on behalf of a grateful community I say to you a very happy 90th birthday. May there be many more celebrations to come.
