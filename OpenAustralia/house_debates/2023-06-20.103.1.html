       <p>
        This evening I pay tribute to a dear friend of mine. I pay tribute to Dr Mark Robinson MP, who is the member for Oodgeroo in the Queensland state parliament, formerly the member for Cleveland, as the electorate was known. Dr Robinson has announced that he will finish his parliamentary career at the end of this term of the Queensland parliament. He is at pains to point out he's not retiring. He is keen to point out it is not a retirement, but he announced last week in the state parliament that he will be pursuing other opportunities outside of that parliament. I want to spend my contribution tonight paying tribute to his service.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the end of the term he will have served in the state parliament for 15 years, and I think that's a good long stint. He and his wife were mentioning to me that the plan was originally for a 10-year stint, so we've had more than our share of Mark and it's time to return him to his family duties. He is very much the embodiment of a conviction politician. Probably the most important contributions that he has made to the Queensland state parliament were in their recent debates regarding abortion law reform and euthanasia reform. Those two speeches that he delivered on those fronts, and the important work that he did in engaging with stakeholders on those important issues, will stand the test of time as perhaps two of the greatest contributions that have ever been delivered in the state parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mark served in many different roles. He was a deputy speaker during the last term when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        was in power in Queensland. Prior to that, he served as the shadow minister for main roads, fisheries and marine infrastructure. He never took a backwards step in any of his policy positions that he holds, and I think that, unfortunately, came at the cost of his own political advancement. But I think that is actually a testament to him as an individual. It's a testament that he wasn't prepared to sacrifice his own views and his own heartfelt positions on different issues to simply allow him to progress through the political chain. He was someone who was prepared to take a firm stance on issues that were in front of him. I think that if every politician in this place and in the state parliaments across the country had that courage of their convictions, and always stood for what they believed in, and didn't compromise—at least, didn't compromise their own values—then we would be in a better place politically across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a local level, as the representative for the Bowman electorate, which covers his Oodgeroo electorate, I see Mark on the ground as an amazing community leader. He has been fighting for so many of the local projects that we desperately need in the Redlands. He has been an impassioned advocate for new investment in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Redland Hospital
        </a>
        . He has been an advocate for the duplication of the Cleveland rail line. He has a great passion for marine infrastructure, with his background as a marine biologist. He has been a great advocate for the community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Stradbroke_Island" rel="nofollow">
         North Stradbroke Island
        </a>
        , which has had significant challenges over the course of his time in the state parliament. He has been a tremendous advocate for the Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities of North Stradbroke Island as they have had to deal with the advent of native title and the closing of sandmining. The biggest local win that he achieved during his period was the securing of the palliative care service at Redland Hospital that operates throughout our community. There are so many local families that have been touched by the work that service has done, and it exists only due to the advocacy of Mark.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is a man of incredible integrity. He has been a great mentor and friend of mine. My daughter, Laura, who is a great judge of character, absolutely adores him. Every time we see him she wants to get on his lap and have a chat to him. I will cherish every day that I get to spend with Mark over the next year as he finishes his term. A special shoutout to his wife, Julie, and his seven children, who are a great support to him. He is a great Australian and I'm going to miss him. He has fought the good fight, he has finished the race, and he has kept the faith. Thank you, Mark, for all you have done for our community and for your service over so many years.
