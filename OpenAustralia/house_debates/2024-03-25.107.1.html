       <p>
        Before members leave, I have a short statement to make for the information of members. One of our long-serving senior parliamentary officers, Mr James Catchpole, will shortly retire. Many of you know James, who is currently Clerk Assistant (Table) and prior to that was the Serjeant-at-Arms.
       </p>
       <p>
        James joined the Department of the House of Representatives in March 1991. James spent many years working in the Committee Office and also in the Table Office, and as the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms. In 2016 James was promoted to the department executive as Serjeant-at-Arms. During his time as Serjeant-at-Arms, James had the important role of enabling the House to keep operating during COVID-19â€”such as on members' travel, quarantine requirements and the changes to chamber arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        James has also made a strong contribution as Clerk and Deputy Clerk at the table in the House and Federation Chamber. He is here with us today in his final question time. As this is his last sitting week before embarking on his retirement, I know members will join with me in acknowledging James for his 33 years of dedicated support and guidance.
