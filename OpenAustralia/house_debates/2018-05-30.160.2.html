       <p>
        Before I call the minister to propose a schedule for consideration of the portfolios, I'd like to remind all members of the purpose of the consideration in detail stage and outline the way it is expected to proceed. Shortly, the Federation Chamber will be asked to agree to a proposed schedule for the times for consideration of portfolios. This may need to be varied upon. It is a useful guide to assist ministers and members to arrange their commitments. Chairs will not be seeking to enforce this arrangement strictly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will be alternated between the government and non-government sides as always. Even though this debate sometimes takes the format of question and answer, this is not question time. Ministers and government backbench members both will be considered as speakers on the government side, and should bear this in mind when they seek the call. All speakers are required to be relevant to whichever portfolio is being examined, but there is no requirement of direct relevance in respect of any responses. It might be practical for ministers to respond to more than one speaker when they seek the call, and I note that this general arrangement applied last year and seemed to allow maximum participation in this stage of debate. Each minister and member will have up to five minutes to speak each time they are called, but they may wish to speak for a shorter time. Ministers may wish to make an introductory statement when debate on their portfolios begins, but, as they are not moving amendments, that is a matter for them to decide.

         For the convenience of the chamber, I won't make an opening statement. May I suggest that it might suit the Federation Chamber to consider the items of proposed expenditure in the order and groupings shown in the schedule, which has been circulated to honourable members? I also take the opportunity to indicate to the Federation Chamber that the proposed order for consideration of portfolios estimates has been discussed with the opposition, and there has been no objection to what is proposed.
