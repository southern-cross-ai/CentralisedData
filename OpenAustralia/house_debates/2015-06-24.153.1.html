        As a member of parliament, one of the most enjoyable experiences is visiting schools and meeting students who are the future of our great nation. During my visits, I am always amazed to hear about the great achievements of our local school students and I wanted to provide them with an opportunity to have their voices heard in federal parliament. This year, I launched the Dobell schools speech competition and invited year 5 and 6 students to write a short speech on the topic 'Kids can make a difference,' with the winning speech to be delivered in parliament. I received a number of great speeches from local students capturing how they see our world, full of imagination and hope for the future. I am pleased to announce that the winner is Erica Field, an 11-year-old from Tuggerah Public School. This is Erica's speech on 'Kids can make a difference':

        Making a difference doesn't have to be world changing, it can be as small as smiling at someone. Kids make a difference from the day they are born, they change their parents' lives, in a good way of course. Kids can make a difference simply when they are at school, in their community and in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First and foremost, kids can make a difference when they are at school. They can make a difference by being quiet when the teacher is talking and that ensures that the class will learn what the teacher is telling them. At our school, year 5 and 6 students can make a difference by being part of our kindergarten buddy system. They can also take part in being a peer reading buddy. Most schools support different charities and this makes a difference. Kids can make a difference by helping a teacher or doing jobs. Kids can also help prevent and defeat bullying which is a problem in some of our schools.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, kids can make a difference in their community. They can do this by participating in volunteer work such as Bunnings barbeques, fundraising, helping charities and much more. Kids can make a difference in our community by simply being well behaved and having good manners. They say thank you and sorry and smile at people that walk past. Kids can participate in activities such as surf lifesaving and get to the stage of getting their

        (surf rescue certificate). In surf lifesaving, you learn skills for life and learn a lot about the ocean.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last but not least, kids can make a difference in the future. They are the world's next tech experts, inventors and world leaders. Kids will be our future life savers and sporting sensations. They are the teachers of the next generations of kids. What they will have learned will impact on everyone else.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, I very strongly believe that kids can make a difference. They make a difference when they are at school, in their community and in the future.

        Congratulations to Erica and all the students from Dobell who took the time to write and submit outstanding speeches. To each of the participating students, thank you for sharing your thoughts with adults on how kids can make a difference.
