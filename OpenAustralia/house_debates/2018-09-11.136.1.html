        I identify with the member for Chifley's words with regard to the pension and Centrelink. At a time when it has never been more important for our communities to be connected and resilient, it is uplifting to see the contribution of the Inverloch Men's Shed in supporting drought-stricken regions across Victoria. I recently met with volunteers of the Inverloch Men's Shed. They were holding a sausage sizzle outside of Bunnings in Wonthaggi. They were raising funds and awareness of the drought that is impacting much of Australia. I applaud the men's shed members who I had the pleasure of meeting in Wonthaggi: President Julian Sellers,

        , Mal Dunn, Cam Walker and others. They are the shining lights of our local regional communities, providing the local leadership our communities need to thrive and prosper. These are the men who lend a hand when one is needed and volunteer their time to get community events happening.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that day the Inverloch Men's Shed raised more than $2,000. The money is going to the Gippsland drought relief fund. It's a valuable contribution that will be greatly appreciated. I should mention that not one dollar of the money going to the Gippsland drought relief fund will go to administration; it will all be delivered to the people who need it the most. The fundraising barbecue at Wonthaggi sent an important message to farmers and farming communities. The message is: we care about it and the people care about you. In Wonthaggi they care about them, in Inverloch they care about them and in Warragul they care about them. Right across Victoria we care about what's happening to those in drought-affected areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the men's shed for organising the fundraising and encouraging the conversation about the ongoing drought. While West and

        for the most part are incredibly fortunate to be free from the most severe impacts of the drought, there are many regions not as fortunate as our own. Things may look green, but there just hasn't been enough rain to grow the grass or fill the farm dams. The support of the Inverloch Men's Shed and the other men's sheds across the district, together with assistance and drought-relief packages provided by this federal government and the state government, plays an important role during this tough time for farmers and the wider farming communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds are great places. I encourage all men to seek out a men's shed in their local community, get involved and help make a positive contribution to their local community, just like the Inverloch Men's Shed is doing. Once again I give a big shout out to the Inverloch Men's Shed and all those who are connected and engaged around you. You're doing a great job. I love what you're doing. I know this House loves what you're doing. We support men's sheds right around this country. Remember that you will always have our support in whatever you undertake.
