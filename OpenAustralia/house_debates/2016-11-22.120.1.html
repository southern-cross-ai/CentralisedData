        I would like to honour two significant retiring contributors to the parliament of the great state of Victoria who have also been of service to the people of Goldstein:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Asher" rel="nofollow">
         Louise Asher

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        , the state member for Brighton, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Thompson
        </a>
        , the state member for Sandringham. They have both announced that they will be retiring at the next Victorian state election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Murray Thompson has been the state member for Sandringham since 1992. Much loved by his constituents, Murray has a keen eye and a sharp memory when it comes to local issues. He has even taught me a thing or two. I was proud to stand with Murray to make sure our 24-hour service at Sandringham Hospital continued. Many times before he has stood up for the preservation of the Sandringham Hospital when there were efforts to close it in the 1990s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Murray is the local state MP who is always happy to take note of any issues whether they are big or small. He has served many roles in state parliament. He was the shadow minister for veterans affairs, Aboriginal affairs and housing, as well as cabinet secretary. Murray has served the Sandringham electorate with distinction for 24 years. I congratulate him on a most successful parliamentary career. Thank you so much, Murray, for the work that you did.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to thank Louise Asher, who has been the state member for Brighton since 1999. She was originally elected as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Legislative Council
        </a>
        member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Province" rel="nofollow">
         Monash Province
        </a>
        —the now nonexistent Monash Province, I might add. Louise was Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party for eight years, from 2006 until 2014. She also served as a minister in the Kennett government, playing a key role in bringing Formula 1 to Melbourne—a great achievement and legacy we most admire. Louise served on the frontbench for 18 years whilst a member of parliament—an extraordinary achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally Louise worked hard to secure $10 million in capital works funding for the rebuilding of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Brighton Secondary College
        </a>
        and reopening the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Street" rel="nofollow">
         New Street
        </a>
        gates, which may not seem like a big deal to people here but it made a big difference to the people of Brighton. They are an iconic part of the Brighton and Hampton community. It is a great honour to serve and to do so in such high office. On that front, the people of Brighton have been served by Louise Asher, the member for Brighton, with class and commitment for a long period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        We congratulate Louise and Murray on their service to the Brighton and Sandringham communities. We wish them all the best for their future endeavours. As someone who shares an electorate with them in Goldstein, I say thank you and best wishes for the future.
