        My question is to the Prime Minister. How many times did the Prime Minister sit down and talk to Holden's senior executives to ask them what he could do to keep Holden and its jobs in Australia?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because this is a very serious subject. As I have said before and will say again, these are sad times for everyone associated with Holden—the workers, the families of the workers and the communities where the major Holden installations are based.

         As members on both sides of the chamber would know, governments of both persuasions have offered very considerable support to the motor industry over the years and certainly this government stood ready and stands ready to continue to offer very significant support to the motor industry. The difficulty is that, as the local

            As the spokesman for Holden said yesterday, 'It would be wrong to simply attribute it'—that is to say, this impending closure—'to action or inaction on the part of the government.' So there we have it: 'It would be simply wrong to attribute it to action or inaction on the part of the government.' I am not seeking to play the blame game here, I am not seeking to play politics here and I think it would raise the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition if he did likewise. I had several meetings with the motor industry as Leader of the Opposition, including with Mr Devereux, and since the election there have been regular meetings between the Minister for Industry and the Holden company.

              I do thank the member for Boothby for his question. I appreciate that the future of the motor industry is something that he has been grappling with as a local member and as a member of the coalition for several years. This is a sad time for Holden workers, their families and their communities. I want to make it very clear to Holden workers and to the people of Australia that the difficulties which Holden is now encountering is no reflection on Holden workers, who are good workers, who have worked well, and it is no reflection on this country. What Holden announced yesterday is part of a worldwide reorganisation and, amongst other things, involves the closure of plants in Korea and the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. It was, as the managing director of

               <p>
                It has been building as a result of Australia's high dollar, high costs and low volumes. At a time like this, we need to be conscious of the limitations of government, as well as of the government's potential. The then government was unable to prevent the departure from Australia of Mitsubishi in 2008. The then government was unable to prevent the imminent closure of Ford, in 2016, when this matter came before it some time ago. The then government, in March last year, believed that it had secured the future of Holden for a decade. But, despite the investment by the then government, of an additional $275 million, the future of Holden was not secured.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our job now is to build on our fundamental strengths. It is not to play politics, it is not to indulge in the blame game and it is not to peddle false hope. That is why, in coming days, the government will announce new measures that focus on the strengths of the regions most impacted by Holden's departure in 2017, because there are great strengths in these regions—strengths in export education, R&amp;D and niche manufacturing. We will not let these people down. But our challenge is to get them from one job to another job and we will not fail.

                  I can confirm that the government has been dealing constantly with Holden, absolutely constantly.

                   My question is to the Minister for Education, representing the Minister for Employment. I know the minister appreciates that the decision of

                   in Detroit to close operations in Australia by 2017 could have a significant impact on employment in our home state of South Australia. It is important, though, that we plan for today and tomorrow. I ask the minister: what action is the government taking to ensure the Australian economy is focused on growth and jobs?

                    Only three months ago the South Australian public elected a new government, full of promise, with a positive attitude about the future. Of course, while they are disappointed about the decision that

                          The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.

                            say that, they know it is true. But they also expect the government to have a positive, energetic, enthusiastic attitude to the future of South Australia and the job prospects in our state. This government is getting on with the job of putting into place exactly those policies that will guarantee jobs for the future in South Australia. We are introducing policies like one-stop shops for environmental approvals, scrapping the carbon tax and the Minerals Resource Rent Tax—the job-destroying taxes.

                                     My question is to the Prime Minister. The managing director of Holden has confirmed that the federal government was presented with a business case by Holden outlining what was needed to save Holden jobs. Why did the government ignore the business case and persist with its half a billion cut to auto industry assistance and Australian jobs?
