        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the efforts the government is making to ensure that Australian working people are put first when it comes to jobs?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Robertson for her question and I thank her for her focus for her electorate on jobs, and the ability that that gives families in her electorate to build a life. My policy is always to see Australian workers in the front of the line when it comes to getting Australian jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today the government has announced that the role of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
          Fair Work Ombudsman
         </a>
         will now be expanded to monitor key 457 visa conditions. That is because we want to put Australian jobs first. That means the ombudsman will now ensure that 457 visa holders are being paid at the market rate specified in their visa. Secondly, and importantly, the ombudsman will also be able to check that the job being done by a 457 visa holder matches the job title and description approved in their visa.
        </p>
        <p>
         These changes are about two things: making sure that 457 visas are not being used to undercut pay and conditions in our workplaces and, very importantly, making sure that we protect the jobs of Australians by ensuring that 457 visas are used only for a job that an Australian worker cannot fill. Today's announcement means that the 300 staff of the Fair Work Ombudsman will now also be able to check on these matters as part of their day-to-day work. This is all part of the government's policy, of my policy, to put Australian workers first. If there is an Australian worker who can do that job, then they should get that chance.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are now over 100,000 holders of 457 visas in Australia—over 20 per cent more than last year—and the number of applications was up by 38 per cent. Year-on-year growth in applications in the hospitality sector is up 100 per cent and in retail it is up 80 per cent, while in mining it is actually down 18 per cent. I believe there are many jobs that Australians should not be missing out on. For example, there are many 457 visa holders working in the health sector because of the failure of the Howard government to adequately train doctors and nurses for the future. We will never believe that 457s should be a mainstay of our visa program. We will always believe that we should do everything to make sure that Australians are first in line for Australian jobs.
