        My question is to the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness. What were the outcomes of the recent housing ministers council meeting, including in relation to the housing legislative package that is before the parliament?

         I thank the member for Pearce for that important question. She, like many of us in this place, would like more social and affordable rental homes in electorates right across the country. Indeed, that is what we're trying to do. We had the fourth housing ministers meeting in Canberra last week where we discussed the broader ambitious housing policy of the federal government. Indeed, we talked about the whole reform agenda. Critical to that agenda, but not the only thing we're doing of course, is the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill—the $10 billion of the Housing Australia Future Fund—

           that will be there in perpetuity, with returns every year invested in more social and affordable housing right across the country. Indeed, this is our election commitment. We took it to the last election.

            <p>
             When we had it in this chamber, the House of Representatives, those opposite voted against it, except of course the member for Bass. I thank all of the crossbench again for their support. Of course, the Greens party didn't vote at all. When it was considered by the housing ministers last week, every single one of them, including the Liberal minister from Tasmania, signed a letter urging senators to pass this bill. I want to read some of this letter to the House today. The letter says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Housing Australia Future Fund is an important step towards providing more Australians a safe and secure home.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             It provides an ongoing stream of commonwealth funds to support the delivery of social and affordable housing.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was signed by all eight housing ministers from right across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             But of course it's not just the housing ministers who are supporting this fund; critically it's the people on the front line—the people who are providing homelessness services and the people who are building houses, the construction sector. National Shelter are supporting the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Homelessness Australia supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. The Community Housing Industry Association supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. Both Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association support the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Industry Super wants the bill to be supported by the parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the sector involved in supplying more social and affordable rental homes is supporting this bill, so I say to members opposite and to the Greens party: 'Talk to your senators. Tell your senators to support this bill. The time for political grandstanding and further games is over.' There are vulnerable Australians out there today who are relying on this bill to get passed so that we can get more social and affordable homes on the ground for those Australians who need it most. I table the document signed by the housing ministers.
