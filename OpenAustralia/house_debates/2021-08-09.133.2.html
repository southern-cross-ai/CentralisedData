       <p>
        [by video link] My electorate of Fraser has been hard hit by COVID. Victoria is now in its sixth lockdown. These lockdowns have been necessary, but they have hit small and medium-sized businesses across Fraser hard. They have reduced the income of many casual and insecure workers, adversely affecting both them and their families. They have disrupted the education of students—those just starting prep all the way through to those trying to complete year 12. And, of course, too many residents of my community have also had firsthand experience of a family member or a friend getting sick or dying of COVID. In Fraser and in Melbourne's west more broadly, COVID isn't an abstract concept that only happens to people overseas. Fraser residents know the damage it causes and why vaccines are so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the ordeals endured in 2020, we ask ourselves: why has Victoria experienced six lockdowns? There are two reasons, and they are same two reasons that more than half of Australia is currently in lockdown. First, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        government has failed to put in place an effective quarantine system. Even after warnings, the Halton report in 2020 and many international reports pointing out that hotel quarantine is not fit for purpose, this government has not invested in quarantine facilities. It has relied upon state governments for proposals and has been completely reactive. Australia has experienced over 25 breaches of hotel quarantine. It is a system that is a not fit for purpose. These breaches have cause outbreaks and necessitated lockdowns. The other main reason, of course, is that Australia has one of the slowest vaccination rollouts in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        . Our lockdowns are more severe and more lengthy than they need to have been. These lockdowns are costing around $300 million per day across the country, as well as taking an incalculable human toll.
       </p>
       <p>
        But as much as it's important to point out the dire state of this government's performance, it's also important for me to point out that the people of Fraser have so much to be hopeful about when we do get through this pandemic. Labor has a plan to rebuild our country and our economy and to invest in our society. Firstly, I want to point to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Airport
        </a>
        Rail link. Fraser is located in the heart of the fastest growing region in Australia. It is close to the CBD, Melbourne Airport and regional Victoria. Improving our connectivity will be crucial to delivering the jobs and the growth that we need. Fraser will benefit from the massive investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail link. The Melbourne Airport Rail link is a-once-in-a-generation opportunity—an incredible infrastructure project that will provide transport opportunities for local residents to get to the CBD, the airport and other parts of Melbourne and regional Victoria. It will also be a catalyst for economic development, making precincts across my electorate a more attractive place to live in, work in and visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm keen to work with all three levels of government and with community stakeholders to ensure that the community gets the most out of the incredible opportunity of this major project. I've spoken with many residents about this project, in regard to both what they are excited about and also some of their concerns. Now is the time for individuals and community groups to come forward and add their ideas and input to make sure that this project delivers in the right way for our community. This project is a golden chance for the Albion area. We need to ensure that the station and the area around it are improved and that the area provides as much amenity for the local community as possible. It is critical that the federal government listens to the concerns and suggestions of the local community. The investments of the MARL can also help to realise the potential of the Sunshine precinct as a hub for jobs, education, training and health.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to point out that, in relation to health, the Andrews government has delivered so much when it comes to health in my electorate and its surrounds over the last six years. This includes the brand-new Joan Kirner Women's and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Hospital
        </a>
        and substantial investment in Sunshine Hospital. Of course, it is also building brand-new general hospitals at Footscray and Melton. Three new hospitals for one health authority is a remarkable achievement, indeed—and a transformative set of projects for Melbourne's west. This is a sign of what we as a federal government would do, working hand in glove with a pro-healthcare state government, when elected. With the Andrews government, we would build on these substantial existing achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Fraser are doing it tough, but I'm confident that we will defeat this delta outbreak. And, just as importantly, I'm confident that an Albanese government will invest in Fraser and ensure that families, workers, students and those in the healthcare services will all get more opportunities.
