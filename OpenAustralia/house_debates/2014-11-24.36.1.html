       <p>
        I am pleased to advise the House that three people from my electorate of Solomon have been given the opportunity to study and undertake research next year as part of this government's Endeavour Scholarship and Fellowship Program. Christoph Sperfeldt, Yolonda Adams and Pia Harknes have been identified as some of the brightest in our country by winning a scholarship or fellowship. This program will allow these three talented Territorians to further their skills and knowledge overseas and develop Australia's research links while building their international experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cristoph has been awarded a fellowship to study society and culture in Belgium while Yolanda will travel to Canada with a fellowship for

        to study society and culture, justice and law enforcement. Pia has won a scholarship to go to Indonesia to undertake agriculture, environmental and related studies.

        this program will allow 154 top-performing Australians to further their skills and knowledge and for 528 high-achieving recipients from overseas to study in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to be part of this government, which is strengthening ties through study and internships undertaken by undergraduate students. As high-achieving Territorians, I wish Cristoph, Yolanda and Pia all the very best for their study in 2015.

         I wish to congratulate the Australasian Hellenic Educational Progressive Association,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHEPA" rel="nofollow">
          AHEPA
         </a>
         , which recently celebrated 80 years of the founding of the order and 60 years since the founding of chapter Arete. In 1934 in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werris_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Werris Creek
         </a>
         , progressive members of Australia's Greek community got together to establish an organisation aimed at promoting education and supporting charitable causes in Australia as well as promoting Greek heritage and culture, and, of course, to break down some of the barriers that existed at the time between mainstream Australia and the Greek community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the past 80 years this wonderful organisation has supported thousands of young kids in getting a better education. They have been indirectly involved in saving thousands of lives through their support of the children's hospital and medical research in Australia and also through their support of the elderly and children with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         AHEPA is a great symbol of the Greek community's contribution to Australia. My community is particularly fond of the AHEPA because of its support of the children's hospital at Randwick. Over the last few years, they have donated over $1 million to the cause. Recently at their 80th anniversary dinner, they raised close to $30,000 for the children's hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wish to congratulate all of the office holders of the last 18 years who have been involved in the organisation and all of the members for their wonderful contribution to charity in Australia.
