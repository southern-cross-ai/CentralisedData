       <p>
        On indulgence, I certainly join with the Leader of the Opposition, who has already spoken and may have a little more to add in a moment, to celebrate the extraordinary victory of the Diamonds over the weekend.

        It is often said that women's sport does not get the attention that it deserves. I have to say that in the Abbott household it certainly does get plenty of attention. My wife and daughters are netball tragics and, as is well known, I am a netball dad. Lately, there have been very few Abbott family discussions that have not involved the Diamonds and their prospects in the World Cup, which just concluded so magnificently for the Diamonds and for Australia in Sydney yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is our 11th Netball World Cup win. Along with every member of this House, I am sure, I congratulate the Diamonds, magnificently led by

        . As the Leader of the Opposition has just pointed out,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Corletto" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Corletto
        </a>
        played through the game with a broken foot—an extraordinary exercise of courage, endurance, commitment, professionalism and strength. On behalf of our country, we congratulate the Diamonds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say that there have been a few disappointments in sport for us as a nation over the last few days, but the women have done us proud. As always, we can trust the women to do us proud in sport, as in so many other areas. I can inform the House that there will be a parliamentary reception for the Diamonds in this building on Thursday, as is appropriate for an Australian team that has won a World Cup.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lest anyone think that I am neglecting male sport, I should also acknowledge Jason Day's great triumph in the

        <p>
         Thank you for the opportunity, Mr Speaker, to continue what I was saying before about the accomplishments of the Australian Diamonds. Yesterday, 16,000 fans cheered the Australian Diamonds as they defeated the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Ferns" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         . There are few rivalries more intense than the trans-Tasman rivalry. We know that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         prides itself on two sports—rugby and netball—and I am pleased to see that Australia's elite netballers have been successful. These Australian netballers are role models and they are world champions. We have just found out in the last few minutes that not only are we seeing retirements of some players announced but
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlee_Green" rel="nofollow">
          Kimberlee Green

         has also announced her retirement.

         It was a remarkable contest.

         was an inspirational captain. Our goal shooters were incredibly accurate, including

         , and, of course,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Corletto" rel="nofollow">

         played heroically in defence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is a netball nation, but what is most pleasing is that these champions will inspire a new generation of Australian netballers. There is no doubt that elite women professional athletes have not received the equal treatment that they deserve in Australian sport. Famously, netballers were called the 'last great amateurs' a few years ago—not because of their amateur sport but because of their lack of fair remuneration when it came to playing sport. What we would say to Australia's women netballers is: 'You are elite professional athletes; you are strong, determined and dominant; you are Australian role models and you are world champions.' There is only one word to sum up Australia's Diamonds: brilliant.
