        Last Sunday was the rugby league grand final. For the first time in almost 40 years, it was a local derby. The South Grafton Rebels lined up against the Grafton Ghosts. The match was held at McKittrick Parkâ€”also knows as 'the fortress'. Remembering, I am sure you remember, Deputy Speaker Coulton, that last year the South Grafton Rebels won this for the first time in decades. The Grafton Ghosts were the winners in 2014. It was great to see two Grafton teams being the two premier teams in the competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the winners were the Rebels, with back-to-back premierships, winning 26-12. Congratulations to the Rebels. It was a great effort. But the Ghosts can also hold their heads high after a great season. The South Grafton Rebels team included:

        On Saturday, 27 August 2016, Tucabia Public School celebrated 125 years of public education in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley
        </a>
        . Hundreds turned out to celebrate this occasion. There were many stories told on the day, including that of Muriel Firth's parents, Thomas and Mary Sullivan, who came to Tucabia in 1925 to take up a position with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Forestry Commission
        </a>
        . All of her children went to this school, along with many of her grandchildren, and a great-grandchild will be starting at the school next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        William Richard Cave and Jan Phelps settled on a farm at Tucabia. William was one of the main instigators for Tucabia Public School, with his signature on many of the original correspondence concerning the school. Some of their descendants living in the Tucabia area at present include the Lloyd, Jones and Lee families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school has a great history, with many people still keeping this school going strong. Lindal Lucas is the current principal, and she has been there for 16 years. It has 38 students currently, and the other staff include: Rachel Bishop, Cheryl Connor, Kylie Peterie and Traycee Woods. I would also like to congratulate the 125 year committee: Roy Bowling, Susan Grehbert, Amy Moran, Lindal Lucas, Kathy Jones, Shelley Jones, Jean Bowling and Debbie Bultitude.
