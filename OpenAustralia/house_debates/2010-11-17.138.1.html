       <p>
        I rise on behalf of the coalition to speak in support of the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4471" rel="nofollow">
         International Financial Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
        </a>
        . The issues within this bill build on bipartisan support over a number of years. The bill has two key objectives and I will briefly run through each of them. Firstly, as we know from the explanatory memorandum and the minister’s introductory speech, it authorises subscription to additional capital stock in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         International Bank
        </a>
        for Reconstruction and Development, which is part of the World Bank, at a total cost of around $51.6 million. That additional stock will enable the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to better carry out its purpose of providing loans to developing countries. It will do so in terms of the lending levels necessary at this point in time and in prudential standards that are necessary. Specifically, it authorises a subscription by Australia to 7,128 additional shares in the capital stock at a price of around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $120,635 a share, making that total commitment as I just indicated of $51.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the bill incorporates changes to the agreement to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         International Finance Corporation
        </a>
        and to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Convention. The International Finance Corporation promotes sustainable private sector investment in developing countries and is part of the World Bank group, the largest multilateral source of private sector financing in developing countries, with more than 180 member countries. The changes to the articles of agreement reflect an increase in voice and participation of developing and transition economies. As the minister’s second reading speech pointed out, specifically it will do this by increasing basic votes of those participants and in doing so that will implement a G20 commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments with respect to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Convention, are four-fold: to enable insurance coverage of stand-alone debt; to allow changes for the process of investor registration; to allow for greater insurance coverage of existing assets; and to eliminate one requirement relating to coverage of additional non-commercial risks. They have been outlined in detail by the Assistant Treasurer and they are outlined in detail, of course, in the explanatory memorandum. As I said, this is a bill that has bipartisan support. It builds on much of the good work done in the last decade or so and I commend the bill to the House.

         According to the World Bank, there are currently around 900 million people in the world living on less than a dollar a day.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          The World Bank
         </a>
         calls this extreme poverty. That means there are 900 million people who woke up today to try to feed a family on approximately what many of us in the room would have spent on our morning coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Oxford development economist
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Collier" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Collier
         </a>
         , who is visiting Australia next week, has referred to this challenge as that of lifting what he calls the ‘bottom billion’ out of poverty. These are the people living in countries that have experienced stagnant growth rates and where flows of aid in the past have frankly not done what we hoped they would. On balance, aid has raised living standards but we know that mistakes have been made. We know that foreign aid requires more than good intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Effective development economics requires an ongoing assessment of what we do and a critical focus to balance the optimism and the best of intentions that go with our aid programs. I very much appreciated having the opportunity to speak with various groups in my electorate about these challenges we face in overseas aid—groups such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Challenge" rel="nofollow">
          Micah Challenge
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
          World Vision
         </a>
         and Oxfam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Essential to what Australia does in the foreign aid portfolio is the modernisation of the multilateral banks. These institutions have been critical in the fight against global poverty and it is important we make sure that we as Australians do what we can to make sure that the multilateral banks continue to respond to new challenges. Australia’s engagement with multilateral organisations extends the reach and scope of Australia’s country and regional aid programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Bank is one of the central partners in Australia’s aid program. Its convening power allows it to lead donor coordination at a country level and a sectoral level. In days like these it is worth mentioning that the World Bank is a bank that we can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4471" rel="nofollow">
          International Financial Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
         </a>
         will do two things. Firstly, it will give effect to Australia’s G20 commitments to ensure that the multilateral banks have sufficient capital to be as responsive and flexible as possible in the environment that follows the global financial crisis. Secondly, the bill will also allow Australia to adopt a proposed amendment to the articles of agreement to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          International Finance Corporation
         </a>
         —the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFC" rel="nofollow">
          IFC
         </a>
         —and four amendments to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Convention that have recently been adopted by that agency’s council of governors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia’s increased investment will also allow the World Bank to provide lending to middle income countries, such as Indonesia and China, to support their recovery. The investment will provide greater resources for those in the ‘bottom billion’ and will also allow for more rigorous evaluation of what works in increasing living standards and what does not work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Growth in developing countries during the period of the global financial crisis fell from an average of about seven per cent in the preceding five years before the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
          GFC
         </a>
         to just 1.6 per cent in 2009. That has meant that an additional 64 million people around the world have been thrown into extreme poverty—the equivalent of feeding a family on less than the price of a cup of Australian coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
         World Bank lending is playing a critical role in supporting recovery in developing economies and therefore supporting recovery in the global economy. Some developing countries are doing well—China of course comes to mind—but the crisis is going to have significant lasting impacts by increasing the poverty of the most vulnerable people in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Bank and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
          IMF
         </a>
         played a key role in the crisis. Indeed, I cannot resist pointing out on this occasion that when the IMF looked at Australia’s policy response, it was one of the international organisations—though by no means the only one—that noted that Australia’s fiscal stimulus was timely and appropriate to the needs of the crisis. Direct responses included
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $750 billion by the IMF and US$235 billion by the World Bank. In its recent meetings, the G20 has committed to achieving an extra $US350 billion in capital increases for the World Bank, which will allow the World Bank to nearly double its lending.
        </p>
        <p>
         The G20 is also committed to ensuring that developing countries increase their voting power within the World Bank. It is these voice reforms which the legislation today is going towards. It is important that Australia demonstrates commitment to the G20 agenda by ensuring prompt implementation of these reforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has much to gain by increasing its support for the World Bank. Subscription to more shares shows Australia acting as a good international citizen, particularly in response to the global financial crisis. It is also in our national interest to live in a world with less poverty. Australians have shown through their individual contributions to non-government aid that they believe passionately that a world without poverty is a goal worth striving towards. I believe Australians want their government to work towards the same goal. The capital increase demonstrates the government’s willingness to be a global leader on issues related to development and our commitment to the World Bank. It fulfils the G20 commitment to ensure adequate capital resources. In this sense, the reforms we are speaking about today are of a piece with the review of the aid program announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs this week.
        </p>
        <p>
         These amendments introduce no substantial changes to Australia’s obligations to either the IFC or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIGA" rel="nofollow">
          MIGA
         </a>
         . Australia’s actual shareholding will remain unchanged as a result of the increase in basic votes, while its voting share will decline marginally—and I will come to that issue in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         First, I want to briefly mention what the World Bank and its various arms do. The overall goal of the World Bank is to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world, but it does that through five separate arms: (1) the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          International Bank
         </a>
         for Reconstruction and Development,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBRD" rel="nofollow">
          IBRD
         </a>
         , is the oldest arm of the World Bank and its goal is to reduce poverty in middle-income countries and creditworthy poorer countries, operating in the traditional way that the World Bank has since its inception; (2) a newer arm of the World Bank, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association" rel="nofollow">
          International Development Association
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDA" rel="nofollow">
          IDA
         </a>
         , focuses on the world’s poorest countries. Their work is complemented by that of the International Finance Corporation, IFC, the MIGA and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre" rel="nofollow">
          International Centre
         </a>
         for Settlement of Investment Disputes; (3) the IFC contributes to the World Bank’s overall poverty reduction mandate by operating with the private sector in both middle- and low-income countries. The IFC is the largest provider of multilateral financing for the private sector in the developing world; (4) the MIGA promotes foreign investment into emerging economies by offering political risk insurance or guarantees to investors and lenders. It also provides technical assistance and advice to help developing countries attract and retain that critical foreign investment that can allow them to grow out of poverty; and finally (5) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is an autonomous institution that supports foreign investment by providing international facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and their host countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Bank’s work focuses on overcoming poverty through inclusive and sustainable globalisation. The World Bank seeks to alleviate poverty in developing countries by building the climate for investment, jobs and sustainable growth and by investing in and empowering poor people to participate in development. Participatory development is a critical arm of the new strategy to bring more people in the world out of poverty. Together, the arms of the World Bank provide low-interest loans, interest-free credits and grants to developing countries for a wide array of purposes that include investments in education, health and public administration; infrastructure; financial and private sector development; agriculture and environment; and natural resource management.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reforms that this bill envisages are part of a new World Bank strategy that arose in its 2010 meetings. The World Bank has set its strategic priorities as follows: to target the poor and the vulnerable, to create opportunities for growth, to promote global collective action, to strengthen governance, to manage risk and, importantly, to prepare for crises. Australia is a strong supporter of the new World Bank strategy. Australia is supporting the World Bank’s key role in promoting development. It is worth remembering that the World Bank only employs about 10,000 people—half the number of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Taxation Office
         </a>
         —and over 3,000 of those employees work in the more than 100 country offices in the developing world. Many of my friends, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Barron" rel="nofollow">
          Patrick Barron
         </a>
         , have spent time working in those different World Bank offices. I have seen firsthand, in visiting the World Bank offices in Jakarta, the important work that is done in those field offices as well as in the central office in Washington,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC" rel="nofollow">
          DC
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I mentioned that I would come to the issue of reduced voting power, because it is obviously an issue that raises an eyebrow to be bringing forward legislation which reduces Australia’s voting share. The first point that is worth making about this is that the reduction is very small. Australia currently holds 1.49 per cent of voting power, and this will be reduced to 1.33 per cent following the second phase of voice reforms implemented in this bill. It is a small decrease which is part of a large package of reforms, recognising that the World Bank has to keep pace with changes in the world economic environment and that, if we do not modernise the World Bank, the institution risks becoming out of date and not serving those who need it the most.
        </p>
        <p>
         Shareholding in the World Bank, including the IBRD and the IFC, is subject to periodic capital increases. Australia last subscribed to additional shares through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Share Increase) Act 1988 and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Act 1989. Australia’s total shareholding in the IBRD totals 24,464 shares and in the IFC totals 47,329 shares.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, Australia has been part of the multilateral banks since the very beginning. Indeed, you might ask why we were not there from 1944. The answer actually comes back to the history of my own party when it was first faced with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods" rel="nofollow">
          Bretton Woods
         </a>

          Ben Chifley

           agreement—though only by 33 votes to 24—Chifley told this House:

           Perhaps the experiment will fair. But no country which has any regard for the cause of humanity can, for some selfish reason or because some ghosts of the past happen to walk or because of fears created by their experience of a financial and economic depression, refuse to become parties to this agreement. If we have any love for mankind and desire to free future generations from the terrible happenings of the last 30 years, we must put our faith in these organisations.

           Australia has done that. The ninth World Bank president—and one of its most successful—was Australian-born

           , who served from 1995 to 2005. More broadly, Australia as a nation has been a consistent supporter of the work of the multilateral banks. As the bank modernises, so must our policy response. We owe nothing less to the world’s poorest.

            I begin by thanking all members who contributed to the debate—the member for Casey and the member for Fraser for his very wide-ranging and informed contribution to this debate on the

             International Financial Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
            </a>
            , which will implement parts of the reform agenda of the World Bank.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first purpose of the bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to enable Australia to subscribe to its additional capital share at the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank" rel="nofollow">
             International Bank
            </a>
            for Reconstruction and Development. The second purpose of the bill is to amend the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
             International Finance Corporation
            </a>
            Act 1955 to allow Australia to adopt a proposed amendment to articles of agreement of the International Finance Corporation and to amend the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Act 1997 to adopt four amendments to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIGA" rel="nofollow">
             MIGA
            </a>
            convention which have been recently adopted by the MIGA Council of Governors. In so doing, the bill will deliver on the commitment at the G20 Pittsburgh and Toronto summits to ensure that the international financial institutions have appropriate capital for their resourcing needs as well as the commitment to ensure developing countries increase their voting power at the World Bank.
           </p>
           <p>
            In its quick and effective response to the crisis, the G20 has built a reputation as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. Recognising the central role of the international financial institutions in mobilising critical financing in response to the financial and economic crisis, the G20 committed to achieving
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            $350 billion in capital increases for the multilateral development banks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Growth in developing countries fell from an average of about seven per cent in the five years preceding the crisis to 1.6 per cent in 2009, resulting in an additional 64 million people living in extreme poverty in 2010.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Bank" rel="nofollow">
             The World Bank
            </a>
            is playing a critical role in supporting recovery in developing economies and, therefore, the global economy. As the global recovery still faces significant challenges, it is important that G20 countries follow through on these commitments by implementing the necessary changes domestically. Australia’s capital contribution would be at a cost of around US$51.6 million to be paid in over five years. This subscription appeared as a capital measure in the 2010-11 budget and does not impact on the budget bottom line. Australia’s contribution would represent a very small part of Australia’s aid program over this period.
           </p>
           <p>
            The G20 also committed to ongoing and important governance reforms to make the international financial institutions more transparent, accountable and effective. The capital increase will implement the important voice reforms agreed by shareholders of the World Bank, which will increase the voting power of developing and transition countries. The G20 endorsed this package of voice reforms, which will strengthen the long-term effectiveness and legitimacy of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group" rel="nofollow">
             World Bank Group
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            This bill will allow Australia to adopt a proposed amendment to the articles of agreement of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFC" rel="nofollow">
             IFC
            </a>
            that will improve the voice and participation of developing and transition economies in the IFC by increasing their basic votes, implementing the G20 commitment. The bill will also allow Australia to adopt four amendments to the MIGA Convention recently adopted by MIGA’s council of governors. This will modernise MIGA’s mandate and expand the agency’s scope, allowing a greater range of projects to be eligible for MIGA coverage.
           </p>
           <p>
            These reforms will enhance the relevance of these institutions. It is important that Australia demonstrates its commitment to the G20 agenda by ensuring prompt implementation of these reforms. Strengthening the legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the international financial institutions will make them even stronger partners for us in the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting this bill will enable Australia to demonstrate its leadership globally, as well as supporting recovery from the global recession in our region. I commend the bill to the House.
