       <p>
        All the world's a stage, isn't it? I rise today to talk about Passfield Park School, which is a school for some of the most severely disabled children in my community. It's located in Minto and has a very dedicated staff, a wonderful group of parents and a wonderful school council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Passfield Park School is infested with black mould. It's not purpose built. Many of the classrooms are completely inaccessible. Certainly, the upper floor classrooms are not accessible to anyone in a wheelchair and many of the children have mobility issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over four years I have written to three different
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        education ministers. There has been no action. The school is in such bad condition that you or I would not live in it, yet these children are exposed to the black mould and the poor conditions every school day. There has been no action from the New South Wales Liberal government, no action from the Premier and no action from the education ministers, in spite of the fact that on numerous occasions I have written to them requesting they come to the school to see what condition it's in.
       </p>
       <p>
        These children do not have a voice for themselves. We have to advocate for them. The school is an absolute disgrace. It's disgraceful that children with this degree of disability have to put up with such poor conditions, and I urge the state government to act immediately.
