        I rise tonight to speak on the topic of cyberbullying and the disgusting lack of accountability in social media, which has been highlighted nationally in recent weeks. Take the case of Twitter commentator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Dawson" rel="nofollow">

        has very recently urged lawmakers to make a stand after vile comments were made regarding his late mother. And who could forget 19-year-old Olivia Penpraze, who posted a heart-breaking video on Facebook before she committed suicide earlier this year as a result of ongoing cyberbullying. The term 'trolls' given to the pathetic individuals who peddle their malice via social media is highly appropriate, and to this growing national campaign against them I add my own condemnation.

        In Cairns, public figures have become the target of an American registered website called hillbillywatch.com, which claims to be a satirical pro-Cairns blog but in reality is a forum for trashing reputations and fuelling obscenities. Much of what is posted is too vulgar to mention in this place. The site focuses on a local radio host, describing him as a 'caustic, divisive, destructive, and cancerous plague on Cairns'. A local member is referred to as 'the MP (misogynist prick) for Cairns, the "don't rape me" paid local liar for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        '. A council candidate is labelled as a 'bitter old bigot who runs a website known euphemistically as "Residents against Aboriginals?"'. And vocal conservationist Colin Riddell, who has just successfully campaigned to have a cruelty provision, particularly in relation to turtles and dugongs, enacted in the state parliament, is advised to 'take it right up the keister from his LNP mates … do you like it this way, Colon?"
       </p>
       <p>
        Dangerously, this site is not afraid to insinuate sexual misconduct, and the articles generate spiteful remarks with no fear of reprisals, let alone consideration of their target's mental health. One local resident who is frequently targeted heard I was going to tackle this issue. She told me, 'Freedom of speech does not come with a carte blanche licence to ridicule, defame and publish blatant untruths about others under the cowardice of anonymity. The vitriol exhibited is unacceptable to those who try to live by a code of decency and respect for all. Its originator must be made accountable.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a site that targets individuals, and while it may not be physical violence it can easily take the form of these written attacks. I am often vilified, but my policy is to simply ignore it as these people thrive on acknowledgement. In this case, while I do not want to offer it any promotion, I am speaking out because I will not be left with blood on my hands if this harassment gets to be too much for one of its victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        The major problem with these social forums is that while complaints can be lodged with the relevant authorities, the task of revealing their identities, or prosecuting, is extremely difficult. These people—and I understand that there are a number of contributors to hillbillywatch.com—are hiding behind anonymity. Well, no more. If they want to publish on Twitter, Facebook or online forums, they should be transparent and accountable for the impact their comments may have.
       </p>
       <p>
        With that in mind, today I rise to name and shame Brian Lawrence

         McCarty

        , the main blogger behind hillbillywatch.com. McCarty is a 58-year-old American who lives at 7 Whitehaven Court in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        . Information accessible online shows McCarty worked as a sound engineer in Hollywood but moved to Cairns in 1998. He attempted two web ventures, coralseastudios.com and webjazz.com, and I am told both turned out badly. I have received written advice from a former associate that McCarty, desperate to refinance Coral Sea Studios, attempted investment fraud using fake website content and stolen identities. Since 2008, he has been working at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskin_Robbins" rel="nofollow">

        ice-cream franchise on Cairns Esplanade, describing himself as guest relations manager. This associate identifies McCarty as having a severe personality disorder, with a dark side driven to, 'defame strangers and damage their businesses'.

       <p>
        Free speech is one thing, and I have nothing against clever satire. But I strongly support any moves by this House to put better processes—
