       </p>
       <p>
        It has been 12 months since Labor took the decision to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax and we have seen 12 months of paralysis from the government on housing affordability. We have had twelve months of policy paralysis from the government of Australia on the issue of housing affordability, as right around Australia young people wonder when the government will stand up for them. When will their government give them a level playing field when it comes to the great Australian dream?
       </p>
       <p>
        The answer is: not on their watch! Not while this Prime Minister is in his chair, because this Prime Minister's plan is to get rich parents if you want to get into the housing market. And the Deputy Prime Minister's plan is to move to the bush. That is the entire extent of the vision we get from this government—
