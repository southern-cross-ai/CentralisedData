        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the revelation in Senate estimates today that parents who have had their welfare payments suspended under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAM" rel="nofollow">

        will receive the schoolkids bonus even if their child does not attend school. Does the Prime Minister agree that parents who have had their welfare payments suspended and whose child does not attend school should receive the schoolkids bonus?

         To the member for Menzies: I believe it is a good idea to benefit 1.3 million families with the costs of getting the kids to school. I do believe that. I also believe that it is appropriate that there is welfare conditionality when people, despite assistance and despite work, are not putting their kids in school. That is why we introduced the school attendance measure. I note that, for all of the cant on the other side, it is this government that has got on with the hard jobs of welfare reform in the interests of children, like ensuring that weekly benefits are contingent on kids being in school. It is one of our proud reform measures.

          Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a very straightforward question about whether she agreed that parents who have had their welfare payments suspended and whose kids do not go to school should get the schoolkids bonus. That is the question she has to answer.

           <p>
            Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. I am answering the member for Menzies' question. On the member for Menzies' question, I believe that weekly welfare benefits should be contingent if people are not getting their kids to school, and it is this government that has introduced it, not those over there, despite all their cant and hypocrisy on the question. This government has introduced it. On the schoolkids bonus, I believe that 1.3 million families should have the benefit of additional resources to help get their kids to school, and I know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip that money out of their hands.
           </p>
           <p>
            A little bit earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition was in his party room referring to me, and for once he got it right. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I will stand up and fight for working people and their families and I will do that every day between now and the next election. I will stand up and fight and make sure that working people benefit from our strong economy. I will stand up and fight and make sure that we are appropriately spreading the benefits of the boom and I will stand up and fight and make sure families are getting assistance to help them make ends meet.
