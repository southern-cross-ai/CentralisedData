        One of Sydney's most beautiful and idyllic beaches is under threat. Yarra Bay, on the north side of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Botany Bay
        </a>
        , is proposed to be developed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Liberal government and the cruise industry to build a massive cruise ship terminal. If this proposal goes ahead, the last remaining beach on the northern side of Botany Bay will be destroyed. But it's not just the beach that will be destroyed; tens of thousands of years of Aboriginal heritage and culture will be destroyed with it, much of the rare marine environment of Botany Bay will be under threat, and the peace and harmony of this beachside community will also be destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 17 November I was pleased to join over a thousand locals who attended a rally at the Yarra Bay Sailing Club to protest this decision of the New South Wales Liberal government. They heard from locals, scientists, fishers, sporting clubs, local registered clubs and political representatives in opposition to this proposal, but the most powerful contribution on the day was from Noeleen Timbery, the Chair of the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council. Ms Timbery spoke of the significance of Yarra Bay to Aboriginal people. The name 'Yarra' is an Aboriginal word for 'flowing', so the Aboriginal people of that area lend that name to the bay. The bay's been central to the lives of Aboriginal community in the area for thousands of years. It's a source of food with fishing, in the area right where a proposed cruise terminal is to be built. The shores there have been a meeting place, and the community have lived there for thousands of years. And all of this heritage will potentially be destroyed if this proposal goes ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Noeleen spoke of the fact that, when the airport was built, the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council weren't consulted. When the port was built, they weren't consulted. When the bulk liquid goods facility was built, they weren't consulted. When the port extension was built, they weren't consulted. This is the only bit of natural heritage that the Aboriginal community have left on the northern side of Botany Bay, and the government and business now want to take it away. It's an utter disgrace. Once again it represents government and industry disrespecting the Aboriginal communityâ€”ignoring and trampling over the rights of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         First Australians
        </a>
        , who have given so much to that local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the companies and businesses that are involved in the destruction of Aboriginal heritage and the natural environment through this proposal to withdraw their support for a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay. I'm speaking of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Caribbean" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Caribbean
        </a>
        . I'm speaking of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Ports and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Port Authority
        </a>
        of New South Wales. Don't be involved in the destruction of natural heritage and Aboriginal heritage. I call on the Prime Minister to intervene. His electorate is on the other side of the bay. This beach is much beloved by thousands from our community in Sydney. I call on the people of Sydney to get behind the campaign to save Yarra Bay.
