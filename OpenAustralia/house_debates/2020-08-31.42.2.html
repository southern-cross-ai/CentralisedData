        The Australian Federal Police proposes a fit-out and security hardening of its new leased premises in West Perth. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        Western Command headquarters lease expired in November 2017 and has continued to be occupied through lease extensions. It was deemed that the current location is not suitable to meet current threat mitigation requirements. The fit-out works are necessary to mitigate the risks associated with the AFP's vulnerability assessment, which was based upon improvised explosive device protection, intruder resistance protection and system response capability. The estimated cost of the works is $27.1 million and will be funded through landlord incentive and departmental appropriation. The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 30 April 2020. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in November 2020 and occupation of the building is scheduled between June and August 2021. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
