       <p>
        Last week, 15 to 21 May, was National Volunteer Week. That gives me a chance today to give a shout-out to all of our amazing local volunteers in the Bendigo electorate. This year I would like to particularly focus on people who volunteer in our community and health sector. Our community houses throughout the electorate would not survive if it weren't for the amazing work of volunteers in Kyneton, Castlemaine, Heathcote, Maldon and Greater Bendigo. We have a number of community and neighbourhood houses and centres that do great work. There are all the community meals that they prepare, the volunteer reading group that they have and the work that they do to help elderly people with their gardening. There are also community houses that help with organising and coordinating events like our recent Pride events and festival. Our community lunches in particular would not happen without the great work of the volunteers who help out.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our health sector, we have a number of volunteers who've come back, even after COVID, to be volunteering in our health setting. I'd like to give a special shout-out to all the volunteers at Bendigo Community Health Services that assist in the emergency department. It's been tough in the emergency department, particularly as we are coming into flu and COVID season. Every night, there are long waits in the emergency department of Bendigo health, and I know how hard the volunteers work to help keep people calm and to help them navigate their way through a complex system. Whilst we work to rebuild Medicare, we know that their job will continue to be challenging. I say 'job' because it does feel like a job sometimes for these volunteers. They turn up and do their shift. The only thing that really distinguishes them from the others in an emergency department is they wear a red T-shirt and they are not paid for their dedication and quality of care.
       </p>
       <p>
        My final shout-out is to the amazing people that work in emergency relief. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet and catch up with the new volunteers at Sunshine Bendigo. They are one of the emergency relief organisations that supply emergency support for families with young childrenâ€”everything that they may need on the birth of a child or if they've had to move quickly and have children under five. This includes pots, prams and warm clothing for the winter. You name it and they are there to support people with it. They recently had to move premises. It took a village to move them, but they did it. I give a special shout-out to the people at Bendigo Foodshare, who tell me that there's never been a greater demand for emergency relief and food support services.

        would stop if it weren't for the great work of our volunteers. I'd like to give them a shout-out and encourage others to think about volunteering to help their community, their friends and their neighbourhood.
