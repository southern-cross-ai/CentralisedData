        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre long-time servant Linda Rowan. I thank her for the many years she has contributed to the centre. After 40 astounding years of service, Linda has recently retired from her role as an administrator with the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre. It prides itself as one of the best facilities in Australia for over-50s, and Linda has contributed countless hours to making the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre the wonderful place that it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre celebrates the diversity of our region's older people and promotes a positive image for ageing. It also helps seniors to continue contributing to community life and to retain their independence. While Linda may have officially retired, this local powerhouse will not be slowing down any time soon, with plans to stay on at the centre in a voluntary position.
       </p>
       <p>
        Linda is just one of the many amazing people you will find in Logan who dedicate their time to helping others. I would like to congratulate all of the management, staff and volunteers at the Beenleigh and Districts Senior Citizens Centre for providing a valuable service to our region's seniors, and for creating a positive community environment where seniors are respected and appreciated, as they should be. Thank you for your 40 years of service, Linda. I look forward to continuing to work with you and the centre in the years to come.
