       <p>
        When I visit retirement villages across the coast, I'm often asked about what we're doing to guarantee essential services for older Australians, including almost 31,000 people aged over 65 in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . Last week, I was at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentwood_Village" rel="nofollow">
         Brentwood Village
        </a>
        meeting with residents and hearing about what was important to them. We shared our plan to support older Australians, and I listened to their thoughts on the future of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I also had a particularly special visit to a local retirement village, where the Wood Glen Retirement Village association hosted the Prime Minister for a seniors forum. It was a wonderful event, with more than 100 guests joining us from Wood Glen as well as from neighbouring villages Tarragal Glen and

        </a>
        . It was a great chance to hear from older Australians about what matters to them and an opportunity for them to ask questions of the Prime Minister.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hanson" rel="nofollow">

        of Tarragal Glen asked a question about the cost of electricity. John Anstice asked about tax reform. We also heard from many self-funded retirees who spoke to us about Labor's retirement tax and the attack on their savings.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the members of the residents committee, Chairman Dr Tony Neaverson and Vice Chairman Dr Jim Paterson, thank you for all your hard work in putting together this event and for your thoughtful remarks, for your great questions and for the delicious morning tea. To the village manager, Vanessa Fordyce, and RetireAustralia's
