       <p>
        With unemployment rates at record highs and so many businesses operating at reduced capacity, there can be no more urgent priorities for this nation than creating jobs and stimulating local economies. The former Labor government recognised the importance of post-crisis stimulus in 2008, when it committed $26 billion to a far-reaching infrastructure program across the nation—investment that turned out to be central to protecting Australia during the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Indeed, it didn't just protect us; it saved hundreds of thousands of jobs and shepherded us through catastrophic economic conditions, with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">

        credit rating from all three rating agencies. Meanwhile, every other developed nation on the planet plunged into recession. It's no wonder that the Treasurer at the time, Mr Wayne Swan, earned the coveted title of the 'world's best Treasurer'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now it's time for the Morrison government to follow Labor's lead and deliver on vital infrastructure projects to stimulate local economies and communities like Newcastle. To be fair, the government has brought forward some local roads infrastructure funding in my community. In response to a request from government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         City of Newcastle
        </a>
        identified $62 million worth of excellent road projects that were shovel-ready or could be made shovel-ready quickly. They are projects I was very pleased to support in my letter to the Deputy Prime Minister. I acknowledge that the government made a very modest commitment of $1.1 million to fast-track some of those roads projects, but this investment falls way short of actual need.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Newcastle there is a plethora of local projects for the government to support—projects that will create jobs and help grow our economy. The list of these vital projects includes projects like the expansion and diversification of the Port of Newcastle, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle Airport
        </a>
        expansion, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Transport" rel="nofollow">

        network, the Hunter Sports and Entertainment Precinct, the Lower Hunter Freight Corridor, high-speed rail, and the highly anticipated redevelopment of the Newcastle Art Gallery. These are all known projects to the government. Indeed, many of them have ranked highly in the independent reports of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Equally deserving candidates include the management of Stockton Beach erosion, a ferry terminal for Wickham and flood mitigation at Wallsend. There are also less costly options in the mix, including the Newcastle East End streetscape upgrade, an organic processing facility for the Summerhill Waste Management Centre and much-needed upgrades for our local sporting fields and facilities. Let's not forget our six surf lifesaving clubs and ocean baths. These coastal facilities are all in need of upgrades and replacements. And social housing remains urgent. These projects will make a huge difference to my community if they secure federal backing. I'm calling on the Morrison government to help create jobs and drive Newcastle's economy by investing in these important local infrastructure projects.
