       <p>
        I would like to draw the attention of the House to a notable anniversary in my electorate; namely, the centenary of the founding of the community of Megan. Earlier this week, I had cause to mention how voluntary efforts of individuals can contribute so much to the health of rural communities when I spoke on the passing of Mrs Madeline Halpin, who was the grandmother of the member for Hunter. I note his presence in the chamber today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The way in which so many in Megan have given their time to celebrate the history of their community is worthy of note. It was on 27 September 1906 that a ballot was held at the Bellingen Court House for 29 blocks of land at what was then known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cattle_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Wild Cattle Creek
        </a>
        . The blocks varied in size from 134 acres to 457 acres and were priced from the princely sum of £1 5s 0d ranging up to the exorbitant price of £2 5s 0d. The successful applicants had to occupy the land within three years, and the first settlers arrived in 1908, setting up temporary dwellings, clearing the forests and putting up fencing. As more settlers arrived with young families, a school was built and then a recreation ground. The timber boom ensured the success of the community, with two mills being built in the early years, and the preparation and transportation of timber providing many jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was in 1917 that the residents came together to chose a name for the community. The Welshman Lloyd George was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
        </a>
        at that time and the residents decided to adopt his daughter’s Welsh name, Megan. The pronunciation has since been changed to ‘Meegan’.
       </p>
       <p>
        In spite of the opportunities offered by the demand for timber, life was still undeniably hard in such an isolated community. During the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        , work started on the Glenreagh to Dorrigo railway, which offered the prospect of relief and another opportunity for prosperity. The first trains ran in December 1924. Around 700 men worked on the line and it was reported that around 3,000 people were living in the area at that time. That figure has since declined to around 200. It is significant that the residents committee has organised the centenary celebrations. The Megan Progress Association and its members are indeed focused on progress through nurturing their sense of community while marking their rich past.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the main features of the centenary was the preparation of a book containing photographs and personal reminiscences, including some from the earliest days of the settlement. It is a fascinating record of the growth of a community, how life was lived and how it has changed throughout the last century. I would like to pay tribute to Nigel and Elaine Adams, who compiled the material for the book. I shall be placing a copy of the book with the Parliamentary Library. I also pay tribute to Bill Mark, the association president, to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Parker" rel="nofollow">
         Kathleen Parker
        </a>
        , who was the driving force behind the celebrations, and to Jim and Mary Kell and Barbara Carter for their very strong contributions. I was delighted to attend the celebrations, which included a barbecue, a sing-along—which included many songs that were popular in 1906—the burial of a time capsule, and the cutting of the centenary cake by three of the oldest residents: Mr and Mrs Ward and Mrs Wilson.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we find it hard to try to anticipate what the next 100 years hold for the community of Megan, we should perhaps comfort ourselves with the knowledge that the future was equally uncertain when those first settlers attended the auction in Bellingen in 1906. As I have said, one of the early milestones in the community was the building of a school. The school has long since closed. Another milestone was the building of the railway, which was needed to take produce to market and to deliver goods to the plateau. The railway has also closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the population of the area may have declined with the decline of the timber industry, Megan is still on the map. It survives. The community of Megan will meet the challenges of the 21st century just as the original settlers met the challenges of the 20th century. I commend the efforts of the local community in celebrating their centenary.
