        I note the remarks of the member for Greenway and I hope that she reproaches and censures the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">

        , whose cheap jibe this afternoon—‘Are there any Australians left in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>
        Former Labor leader and Minister for External Affairs Dr Herbert Vere Evatt is quite rightly acknowledged as one of the creators of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations

         President of the UN General Assembly

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Charter" rel="nofollow">

        ’s humanitarianism did Australia proud on the international stage. I wonder what he, as a champion of human rights, would have thought of an invitation issued under the auspices of senior Victorian Liberals which has come into my possession. Mr Speaker, let me quote from this invite:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        with Guest Speaker
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secretary General
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan" rel="nofollow">
         Kofi Annan
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Under that there is this quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Some 840 million people in the world suffer from chronic hunger. We need to do far better if we are to achieve the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goal" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goal
        </a>

       </p>
       <p>
        Then there is:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP" rel="nofollow">
         RSVP
        </a>
        s on this invitation are to Mr Tony Barry, the deputy state director of the Victorian branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal Party of Australia
        </a>
        , and Mr Alan Anderson, an adviser to Attorney-General Philip Ruddock. This event was simply a grog-on for Liberals. No funds were raised for the world’s hungry and dying. They misused the United Nations logo and insulted Kofi Annan. It is an absolute disgrace and shows the type of out-of-touch arrogance which sets in after 10 years in government. This is in extraordinarily poor taste. It mocks the poor and hungry and international efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty. One wonders what the Treasurer’s brother,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Costello" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Costello
        </a>
        , who does such a great job raising awareness and fostering compassion about these issues, would make of this Liberal Party boorishness. Those involved should apologise to the United Nations and make a suitable donation to an appropriate UN body such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
         UNICEF
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This week we are seeing how good the Liberals are at parties celebrating their 10 years in power. You have to wonder how many Liberals went to this particular Liberal bash. We have it on good authority that Treasurer Peter Costello’s chief of staff attended, as did a host of other senior staffers. Were there any MPs in attendance? This is something the Liberal Party ought to come clean on. With the evidence coming out on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        and the government’s contempt for ethical international relations, you can understand perhaps why they do not like the United Nations. But it is unacceptable to hold the UN and Kofi Annan in contempt and it is even more unacceptable to mock the poor and hungry. That really is beyond the pale. This invitation reveals to the community the true colours of the Liberal Party. This invitation is little better than
