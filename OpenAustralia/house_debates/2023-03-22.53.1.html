        For nearly 50 years, Footscray Community Arts has been a leader. The first community arts centre of its kind, it was established by unionists and activists who understood the importance of being able to tell their own stories. Its home,

        , an 1870s bluestone landmark on the banks of the

        Footscray Community Arts continues to be a trailblazerâ€”the only mainstream arts organisation signed up as a registered provider with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. People with a disability have long been excluded from society. Particularly insidious are the low expectations of the contribution that disabled people can make. Footscray Community Arts is dedicated to overturning this perception. Its ArtLife program, which has run for 30 years, supports 40 deaf and disabled artists to develop their practice in workshops that run from Monday to Friday. ArtLife also offers a residency program focused on helping artists reach an ambitious next level. Steven Tran, one of seven in this program, received a grant in 2021 from the
