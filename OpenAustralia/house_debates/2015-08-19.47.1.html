        I rise to bring to the attention of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Parliament
        </a>
        the recently established 'Where's William? Help Bring Him Home' campaign. As many people would be aware, nearly 12 months ago the quiet village of Kendall in my electorate was turned upside down with news that the young three-year-old toddler
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyrrell" rel="nofollow">
         William Tyrrell
        </a>
        had disappeared while he was at his grandmother's home. Despite a massive search of the area by police, emergency services and the community not a trace or a sign of William was found, leading authorities to believe that something must have happened to him. The idea that a young toddler could just simply vanish while he was playing in his grandmother's yard in a quiet little village in the country has been devastating for William's family and our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 'Where's William? Help Bring William Home' campaign is working in collaboration with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        , Bravehearts and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers" rel="nofollow">
         Crime Stoppers
        </a>
        . My electorate, my people, have not given up on the search for young William. Somebody must know something. The campaign to find William Tyrell continues. Somebody must have seen something, somebody knows something or somebody can help bring William homeâ€”is that somebody you? I would encourage anyone with anything new that they may know or think they know to contact police because that small bit of information might be the final piece in the puzzle that the police need to find William and bring him home to his family.
