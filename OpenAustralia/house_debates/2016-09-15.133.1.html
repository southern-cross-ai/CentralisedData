        I rise today to pay my respects to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Reilly" rel="nofollow">
         Bill O'Reilly
        </a>
        , whose last campaign was the recent federal election we have all just been part of. I am joined by the member for Grayndler, who was Bill O'Reilly's local member for 20 years. Our tribute to bill is because he was a true believer. He passed away on 24 July 2016, just 10 days after his 85th birthday. I want to pass on our deep regard to Kerry-Ann and to Bill's family. Bill's life has made all our lives richer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill was overseas and returned to Australia in 1972 to take up an academic position in the pharmacy school in Adelaide. This true Labor man embraced the changes that were taking place in this country.

         Don Dunstan
        </a>
        was the South Australian Premier and Labor was soon to in the federal election, ending 23 years of conservative rule. His wife, Kerry Ann, said that Bill constantly lectured her about the ills of the McMahon government, so she said, 'Well, re-join the Labor Party and do something about it,' and Bill did that. He remained a Labor member until his death, just two months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill never lost the fire in his belly. He and Kerry Ann attended many fundraisers and did handouts and all the sort of work that a good Labor family does. Bill's core belief was pure Labor: equality, education and health for all. From 2008 until early this year he was vice president and president of the Ashbury branch of Labor. Bill was an active and considered member of Labor, with loads of passion and a big heart. He was an absolutely wonderful man.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned Bill in my valedictory speech, as I did in my inaugural speech, in 2003, and I would like to read from that: 'In my inaugural speech I also recalled the story of some advice given to me by Bill O'Reilly, a well-respected local branch member. â€¦ Bill said to me, "Girl, don't you ever change".' I have held onto that advice right throughout my parliamentary career, and I make a commitment now to take Bill O'Reilly's advice into this place, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        To his wife, Kerry Ann, and his children, Michael, AnneMarie, Chiara and Damian, and his grandchildren, I offer my sincerest condolences, along with the member for Grayndler and all of the wonderful branch members and the Labor family of Canterbury, Grayndler and Barton. Bill was an inspiration to all who knew him and he will be very deeply missed.
