        Regional arts form a very important part of many communities around my electorate. They provide a really valuable community service and a place for community to come together to share in their common interest, which is artistic endeavour. So it was that last Friday night I had the pleasure of attending the Southern Beaches Regional Arts organisation's annual Sorell Regional Art Prize.

        congratulate Sue Banks, the president of this organisation; Jodi Chivers, the vice president; and the irrepressible Saakia Itchins, secretary, publicity officer and also exhibition organiser, on what was a fabulous event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the winners of the various awards. They include Natalie Murden, who won the Sorell Council Acquisition Award; Claire Doran, who won the Southern Beaches Regional Arts Prize, worth $800; Hannah Van der Merwe, who won the Sorrell Lions Club Award, worth $300; Steve Wakeling, who won the Holts Award;

The Lufra Residency Award went to Sheila Vince. There were a number of other highly-commended participants. It was a wonderful night, attended by the mayor of Sorell,

        May I also take this opportunity to wish all of those in this place a very merry Christmas, but particularly my staff: Caroline, Sharna, Lorraine, Charles, Jane, Kirsty and Alison, who has recently left my employment. She will be replaced by Cassie. I wish them all a happy Christmas. Can I thank the electorate, particularly for the support that they have shown me. We have had some success together and I look forward to working with my community groups, with my councils and with my constituents to deliver further benefits next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can I particularly take this opportunity to thank my wife, Amanda, and my two sons, David and John. As has been said by many: we are the volunteers in this business; they are the conscripts. As some of you might agree, we do not always give them the thought and care that they absolutely deserve in the challenging role of being married to or being in the family of a member of parliament. I thank them very much. I love them all dearly. Next year I hope to be a better father to my sons and a better husband.
