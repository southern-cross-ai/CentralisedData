        Last Friday I had the privilege and honour of attending Holsworthy military barracks in my electorate to witness officers and soldiers of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment and the 1st and 2nd commando regiments receiving their berets. I thank my colleague and friend the member for Menzies, who attended with me, and I acknowledge his service with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Command" rel="nofollow">
         Special Operations Command
        </a>
        . The special operations and commando regiments form a crucial strategic component of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and of our national security and defence overall. The Special Operations Engineer Regiment provides counterchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive mobility and survivability capabilities to our special operations soldiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within my electorate, residents of the neighbouring suburbs of Holsworthy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_Grove" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        know that the barracks provide protection not only for them but for all Australians. These are our frontline troops if our nation is ever threatened in a terrorist event. They've also been our frontline troops serving overseas in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , Iraq and Afghanistan. In conflict, it is the special ops engineer regiment that will be called upon to neutralise threats and provide support on live incident sites. It was humbling to witness the special ops engineer regiment beret parade, which served not only as recognition of their training and expertise but as a reminder of the unique responsibility that they now hold.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the Special Operations Command, the 1st and 2nd commando regiments conduct large-scale offensive, support and recovery operations beyond the scope and capability of other Australian Defence Force units. These regiments and their predecessors have been involved in support or conflict overseas. The receipt of their berets on Friday was the culmination of 18 gruelling months spent training for the honour to serve as a commando. These are the elite within our Defence Force. Many others did not make it through. I learnt on Friday that their training was physical but also explored their mental fitness for the role, as well as both their leadership and their 'followship' abilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am immensely proud that my electorate houses this facility at Holdsworth. At 20,000 hectares, it spans over half of my electorate geographically. It is also one of the most important Army and triservice training institutions in the country. Through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Barracks
        </a>
        , the Australian Defence Force is a large employer within the Hughes electorate, both directly and indirectly. In that context, I pay particular thanks and acknowledge the cleaners, the logistics and transport workers, all those involved in our defence industry and other support workers whose tireless efforts at Holsworthy provide great support and enable our service men and women to conduct very important national defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Australians, it is easy to take for granted the quiet sacrifice made by our Defence Force. However, being able to attend these ceremonies with the member for Menzies gave me the unique perspective of viewing them through the eyes of a soldier. I would also like to acknowledge in particular the families and friends of our veterans, particularly those who supported our commandos and special ops. It was wonderful on Friday to see the support given to the newly qualified officers upon the presentation of their berets. Whilst it is the greatest honour to serve one's country militarily, the sacrifice of veterans' spouses, partners, children, parents and siblings is real. They've all given a lot to see their loved one join the Defence Force. Often, because of the confidential nature of the Defence Force, the officers and soldiers are unable to fully share their training and journey with their closest supporters. Many have had to move their family close to Holsworthy to allow them to undertake this service to their country. To these families I say thank you. To the newly qualified special ops engineers and commandos I say, in this place, congratulations and thank you.
