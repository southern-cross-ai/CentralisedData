        Late last year it was absolutely fantastic to get down to Sparks Reserve in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Box Hill
        </a>
        , home of the mighty Box Hill Rugby Union Football Club. Thanks in part to the Morrison government contributing funding of $300,000, Sparks Reserve now has brand-new lighting, supporting the many community groups that use the grounds and also the local economy, with the many jobs projects like this create. The Box Hill rugby club have been fighting for better lighting at their home ground for over 20 years, so I am especially proud to have been able to get this done and deliver on a commitment I made at the 2019 election.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was deeply honoured to be asked to switch on the lights at an event at the club, but the thing that truly makes me most proud is that Chisholm is home to a club that is doing so much good. Last year the Box Hill rugby club ran what it called the Time|Out program. This was a six-week free program designed to support more women in the community to be physically active. The club embarked on this program when they made an uncomfortable discovery. After researching female sports participation trends in Victoria, they found that more than 40 per cent of women do not feel comfortable training in public. This informed the goals of Time|Out to help local women with their confidence, physical and mental wellbeing, and skill development. It also supported them to overcome their fears.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently Time|Out was deservedly recognised at the

        civic awards, with Box Hill Rugby Union Football Club taking out the sport and recreation award for 2022. I congratulate the team behind Time|Out—Lauren Broomhall, Yash Pathak and Abhishek Pratap, as well as Claudia Read, Ella Reid and

        —for all their outstanding work. Also, although I know that he wouldn't want to take the credit away from those I have just mentioned, it wouldn't feel right to not acknowledge club president
