        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Materiel. The Macquarie electorate has two important Defence facilities, one in Glenbrook in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        and the other at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

        Base Richmond. How will the defence white paper deliver jobs and growth for the industries that support these vital bases?

         I would like to thank the member for Macquarie for her question, and I note her strong advocacy for Defence personnel and for defence companies in her electorate. Long may that advocacy continue. She is an outstanding local member.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you know, Prime Minister, the white paper announces—and I am pleased to inform the member for Macquarie—that Defence will commit to a $300 million to $400 million investment at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF

         Richmond between 2021 and 2026. This is important as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Richmond" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF Richmond
         </a>
         is a key part of our capability infrastructure. Indeed, RAAF Richmond is currently welcoming the 10 C27J Spartans—heavy capacity aircraft—which will allow a significant tactical lift and support for the defence forces in conflict or crisis. These aircraft replace the Caribou planes that were retired in 2009. Of course, we cannot forget the important role that RAAF Richmond plays as the home to our trusted
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C130_Hercules" rel="nofollow">
          C130 Hercules
         </a>
         planes, which provide crisis support around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Procurement for our defence forces requires forward planning and investment. Australia's defence forces need to work closely with industry to determine needs like the C27J Spartans. I can inform the member for Macquarie that the announcement today of the government's defence white paper will allow closer collaboration between industry and defence than ever before. Defence needs industry, and industry needs to know how and what it should be doing to support our defence forces. Most importantly, industries that support our defence forces need the certainty to invest in projects and Australian jobs. This government's white paper gives them this certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will establish the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDIC" rel="nofollow">
          CDIC
         </a>
         , which will be the cornerstone of the relationship between industry and defence. We will invest $240 million to establish and embed the CDIC over the next 10 years in order to solidify the relationship between industry and defence. What this means, Member for Macquarie, most importantly, is that, when it comes to real Australians and real jobs in your electorate, and in other electorates around the nation, we are securing our defence industry and we are securing our defence for the nation.
