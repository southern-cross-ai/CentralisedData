        I would like to highlight the work of a very important group in the electorate of Charlton, and that is the Westlakes

        procession. With pride we marched through the main street of Toronto with a strong but peaceful message: that women and children should be able to feel safe wherever they are without the fear of violence of harassment. We were very proud to make a lot of noise on that night. The women I met there that night were truly inspirational. I was moved by their stories and grateful to be part of this empowering event. I particularly recall a story told by a lady named Jenny, a survivor of domestic violence. She shared with us that night a poem that she wrote about a personal experience of being in a violent relationship for 20 years. It was a very moving poem. It was so brave of her to share her story with a large crowd. I know that it will help others.

        The unfortunate fact is that domestic violence is happening behind the doors of far too many homes. We are all responsible for speaking out and condemning it. White Ribbon Day is a major international event, and I applaud the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition yesterday regarding it. The Westlakes Domestic Violence Committee will join in, using the occasion to kick off a 16-day campaign of activism against this crime in our local area. This campaign, which runs until 10 December—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —is an opportunity to better inform victims of domestic violence, and the broader community, that support is available, as well as informing us all about action that we can take to prevent domestic violence. Indeed, an important part of their work is the programs they run at local schools which teach older students the signs of domestic violence and give them the courage to speak up when they know someone is using domestic violence against a woman. On Monday, the committee held a White Ribbon Day morning tea at Toronto, which I am told was very well attended. I was disappointed not to attend personally, but I was very pleased to hear that 24 men there took the pledge to never commit domestic violence against women and to speak up against any violence they witness. This public display is so important in stamping out domestic violence. As the father of a daughter, I applaud these men for taking the public pledge, and for bringing us a step closer to a world where women can live without fear. I thank the Westlakes Domestic Violence Committee for the important work they are doing in the local area.

        Deputy Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to take the pledge here today: I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. That is my oath.
