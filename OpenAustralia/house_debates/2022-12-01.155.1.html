        Well, there he was. He was given the ball. He dribbled it forward, changed feet, got it on his left and sliced it past the keeper. Of course, I talk about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Leckie" rel="nofollow">
         Mathew Leckie
        </a>
        . He became an overnight hero for every kid who's ever dreamt of playing in the World Cup—for every young Socceroo or Matilda who's ever had the aspiration to make the sport's greatest stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're now down to the last 16 with Australia's one-nil win against Denmark. I know the Danes would be commiserating with themselves this morning, but what a fantastic result not just for the Socceroos and not just for the World Cup but, indeed, for Australian sport in general—not just football but sport right across the nation. Our nation prides itself on sport. Of course, at the moment, we've got the men's test cricket going on against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" rel="nofollow">
         West Indies
        </a>
        . I wish the West Indies well. I know they've got a couple of quicks, and cricket's strong when the West Indies are strong. But I digress.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the key to sporting success is having the right infrastructure and programs in place. I know what we did as a government—we were criticised for it in parts—was having the right programs and funding, particularly in country areas, which seem to produce kids who are of the finest quality because they have to be the best of the best. They almost have to be Bradmans of the bush to ever make the state teams, let alone the national teams. They have to be that much better than their city cousins, because they don't have the facilities or the programs and, when they get to the stage where they can be selected in a state or national team, it's that much harder for them because of the ongoing training and expense. I know that, for Football
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        , the new lighting that they received at Rawlings Park was the result of a $450,000 Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program grant. I know the president at the time,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Dobbin" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Dobbin
        </a>
        , was delighted at securing the grant. It went towards the cost of lighting fields 2, 3 and 4. Football Wagga Wagga has a vision to make Rawlings Park a national facility. They want to be able to train the Socceroos and the Matildas of the future. They want to be able to make sure that football at Wagga Wagga can be right up there, ranking with the other major sports—that is, Australian football, rugby league, cricket, netball, and all sorts of sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I say
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        , I mean AFLW as well. Women's AFL is the fastest growing sport in Wagga Wagga and the Riverina region, which is fantastic. Ganmain-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grong_Grong" rel="nofollow">
         Grong Grong
        </a>
        -Matong won both the men's and women's competitions this year. It's a long name. It's a celebrated name. Ganmain-Grong Grong-Matong's football history goes back to the 1890s, as do many of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Aussie Rules
        </a>
        communities in and around our area, even before rugby league broke away from rugby union in the late 1890s in England.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need better facilities. I know the sports program that Senator McKenzie oversaw had its critics, but it was oversubscribed so much that it made it all but impossible to allocate all of the funding that was well deserved and necessary. I hope the incoming government places an emphasis, too, on sporting grants, particularly for country sporting grants. You can't place a price on what that does for country communities. I mentioned the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Island
        </a>
        swimming pool in my previous speech. I will make sure that happens, by hook or by crook. I shouldn't say that now that we've got a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACC" rel="nofollow">
         NACC
        </a>
        in. But I really want that to happen because there's an Aboriginal community that does not have a swimming facility. The next budding Olympic champion could come from that Aboriginal community in the

         Gulf of Carpentaria
        </a>
        . I'll work with the member for Ballarat, the infrastructure minister, to make sure that happens. We'll do it fairly, we'll do it properly, we'll do it according to the books, but we'll do it. Kyle Yanner, the mayor, can rest assured I have his back.

         I would give some comfort to the member for Riverina to observe that proceedings in parliament can't be used as evidence in a court. I think I have that right.

          We live in unprecedented times. It's something that we've heard repeatedly. We're in the midst of a pandemic, we have global tensions pushing up energy prices, our country is currently grappling with floods, and we have a skills shortage. It has been a challenging time for businesses and people. But I am proud to be part of a government that's bringing people together. That's because the Albanese Labor government is about uniting Australia, not dividing it.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Jobs and Skills Summit was about doing exactly that, bringing Australian businesses, workers and community groups together to develop a road map towards building a stronger economy that works harder for people and the nation's productivity. From Bennelong in

          to Belmont in my electorate in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          , community roundtables formed part of the jobs and skills roundtable process to discuss how we can improve lives and livelihoods by increasing productivity, unlocking skills, and creating good jobs and businesses for tomorrow.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Friday 18 November, I held a Swan jobs and skills roundtable to provide an opportunity for 60 businesses and community leaders to have their say on how we can build a stronger economy that benefits our community. Joining me for this event was Toll Global Express
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          , Christine Holgate, who generously shared her insights on adaptability in an uncertain business environment. My community was excited to spend some time with Ms Holgate, who won the 2022 Australian Award for Excellence in Women Leadership. Christine is an incredibly talented business leader and influencer. She has taken the Toll Global Express cash flow cash positive in just eight months, and she deeply cares about her workers.
         </p>
         <p>
          I equally have impressive organisations and leaders in the electorate of Swan. After learning about the challenges for people with a disability getting employment, the town of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria Park
          </a>
          set out an employment target of five per cent by 2025. But then we had outstanding businesses, like Our Ruby Girl, a beloved café in Como. The effervescent owner, Sarah Yates, is trained as a psychologist and has worked in mental health in the disability space. Her passion resulted in her opening a cafe. Fifty per cent of employees at Our Ruby Girl have a disability. I like to think of Sarah Yates as the Twiggy Forrest of the disability space. Twiggy's keen and interested in seeing the transformation of the resource sector in a low-carbon future; Sarah is creating best practice for what employers can do to achieve loyal workers who happen to have a disability. I challenge more employers to be like Our Ruby Girl, and even the Town of Vic Park, who see beyond disability and set targets.
         </p>
         <p>
          Carol Hanlon is another passionate member of Swan. She's the CEO of Belmont Business Enterprise Centre, which provides advice, professional development and mentorship to small and medium-sized businesses, and has done this for 28 years. She's particularly passionate about women in business and the barriers that they face. She would like to see more support for organisations like hers that provide this invaluable support.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then we heard from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
           John Kelly
          </a>
          , a builder who spoke about the need for better support for students wishing to pursue trades so that construction businesses like his can count on future generations to have a rewarding, well-paid career building homes, businesses and community infrastructure. He was also keen to see increased skilled migration and was concerned about where people would live. Interestingly, Christine Holgate's concern was also the cost of rent for her employees.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note that the Albanese Labor government is working on some of these issues already, with an additional $1 billion, joint federal-state funding, for fee-free
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
           TAFE
          </a>
          in 2023 to accelerate the delivery of 465,000 fee-free places. We will increase the migration program ceiling to 195,000 places in 2022-23 to help with those critical skills shortages. And we also have a plan to build one million homes between 2024 and 2030. There is more work to do, and that's why we have this consultation process.
         </p>
         <p>
          All the participants were buzzing with excitement at what our future could look like. Thank you to those participants. And a particular thank you to my state colleagues Geoff Baker, the member for South Perth, and Hannah Beazley, the member for Victoria Park, for their attendance and putting this event together. I'd also like to acknowledge the Town of Vic Park mayor, Karen Vernon, and the
