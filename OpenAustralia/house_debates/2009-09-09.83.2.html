         Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009
        </a>
        , the third in a series of bills to implement long-awaited improvements to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, was passed with amendment by the Senate this morning. Senator Xenophon proposed a number of amendments to the bill; however, the Senate only agreed to an amendment which will introduce a requirement for an independent review of the new separate scheduling arrangements to commence within three years after they come into effect—that is, in 2013. The government envisages that the panel to conduct this review would comprise of persons with expertise in public health, legal matters, and wide industry experience. The government accepts this amendment.
