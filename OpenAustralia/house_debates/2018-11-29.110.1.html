        Earlier this week I asked locals on my Facebook page what they wanted me to raise in parliament. Shirley Watts would like to get rid of political pensions and perks. I can confirm, Shirley, that members elected after 2004 will not receive political pensions, including people like the current Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        : he was elected in 2007 and will not receive a political pension. These changes have been made. They came in 2004.

        Jacquie Nunn said she would like to see citizenship removed from dual citizens who are known terrorist offenders, and Jane Uksi wants to ensure our borders are safe. Ladies, the Prime Minister made a statement on 22 November 2018, along with the Minister of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , that addressed this. We already strip terrorists of their citizenship if they have dual citizenship but that requires, currently, a sentence of six years or more. We will be moving this week and next week to make sure that we remove that requirement and toughen up the law so, if people are convicted of terrorism and they have dual citizenship, their Australian citizenship will be able to be removed.

        and to vote against it. North Lakes is built around that golf course. I'll be fighting hard to make sure it remains a golf course. We already lack sport and recreation facilities in Griffin, North Lakes and

        also commented. Terrip Anala said her biggest concern was lies being told by the Labor Party. That is a concern. At the moment there is the website laborlies.com.au. That will address all of the lies you are so concerned about.

        I thank the people in my electorate for commenting on my page. I will get through more of them. I will do my best to continue to represent you well here.
