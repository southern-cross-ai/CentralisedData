       <p>
        On Friday 7 March I was pleased to be able to invite a delegation from Holsworthy High School to a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, with the Governor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        of Australia Mr Glenn Stevens. Holsworthy High is one of those great schools in my electorate, which, through the stewardship of their principal, Mr John Frew, and thanks to the great work of its teachers, has a proud history and a special place in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Holsworthy High School delegation included the principal, Mr Frew, teachers Mr George Amerikanos and Mr Christopher Lukins, along with students Mikaela Costa, Alexander Helou, Rachel Hembrow, Clayton Hopper, Matthew Mortimer, Hayley Thomas,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wilkinson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Woods" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The school captain Rachel Hembrow was given the opportunity to ask a question of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and her question was: 'We hear about governments borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars. Does this mean that today's generation has been spending in an unsustainable manner, which will result in my generation having to pay it off through higher taxes, fewer services, or both?'
       </p>
       <p>
        Rachel's question was very well received by Governor Stevens, and also by the chair of the committeeâ€”the regalable member for Higgins,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_O'Dwyer" rel="nofollow">
         Kelly O'Dwyer
        </a>
        . It was great to see the youth in my electorate taking such a keen interest in the economic wellbeing of our country and the importance of prudent fiscal management. I would especially like to thank the principal, Mr John Frew, for his efforts in organising the delegation, and the impressive way that they represented both their school and the electorate of Hughes.
