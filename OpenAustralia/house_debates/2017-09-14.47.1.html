        It's great to hear a National Party member to talk about renewables in such a way! There are great sporting groups in the Chifley electorate, out in

        . I want to give a shout-out to one in particular: the Mount Druitt Netball Association. It is always difficult as a basketballer to recognise netball, but I'm proud to do this today. They had their eighth annual awards dinner. They have 150 representative players and coaches. They've got almost 90 representative players who compete in the state age championships and are achieving great results all around. I was pleased to be able to present the under-15s team with the junior representative team of the year award on that night. I want to congratulate president Margaret Weir, secretary Yvonne Richardson and treasurer

        team. They are smashing it on the footy field. They are a first-division team. They only started playing in 2015 and this weekend will be in the AFL Sydney grand final, a tremendous effort. They have so far scored 240 points and only conceded 14. They are playing at Blacktown International Sportspark. I want to congratulate everyone who contributed to the team's success. I wish you all the best of luck. Regardless of the result, you will make us all very proud. Go Magic!
