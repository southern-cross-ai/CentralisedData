       <p>
        I rise to speak about a community organisation based in the electorate of Moretonâ€”the Kyabra Community Association. It is an organisation I was proud to be on the board of before the federal election campaign commenced. Unfortunately I then had to resign so the organisation was not politicised. The Kyabra Community Association does a fantastic job in a number of different areas.

        One of the things they do that I am most proud of is addressing homelessness issues in the electorate of Moreton and the southern areas of Brisbane. They also do what they can in terms of providing housing for people in need. In fact, one of their great initiatives is in consultation with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        and the Liberal Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. They have worked with the Brisbane City Council to move homes that have to be relocated because of the north-south bypass tunnel onto land that the Kyabra Community Association has purchased. They are using those houses to provide housing for people who are struggling at the moment, such as victims of domestic violence or other economic circumstances. They are also a community organisation that provides child care throughout the south side and they are now in consultation with the Islamic Womens Association.
