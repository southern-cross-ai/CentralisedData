         I thank the member for her question. I have made the point repeatedly this week that the Voice has no power of veto, so the answer to your question is obvious. I am not sure what the opposition is missing. This is a practical and simple proposition. This is about making practical change to the lives of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations

         people in this country, and it is also about uniting this country and recognising 65,000 years of history.

          people through a voice improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and why is it important that people avoid false campaigns designed to create fear?

           I thank the member for his question. Let's cut to the essence of what is within our reach. There are two things. There is constitutional recognition of the fact that we share this continent with the oldest continuous culture on earth, which has been here for 65,000 years. The form of that constitutional recognition that they have asked for through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           National Constitutional Convention held at Uluru in 2017 is through a voice.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice" rel="nofollow">
            The Voice
           </a>
           will give us the best practical means that we have ever had to close the gap between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australians get it, because Australians value fairness above politics, Australians value solutions above games and Australians have the sense to look past the fearmongering of some. Earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition apologised for boycotting the National Apology to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations" rel="nofollow">
            Stolen Generations
           </a>
           . Yet, what we have is a return to the same playbook. In January 2008 the Leader of the Opposition said this:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I think the Australian people deserve to know the full details of the implications of this policy including the financial ones. It would beggar belief that they would be contemplating an apology that could open the government up to serious damages claims without knowing what those claims would be.
          </p>
          <p>
           He continued: 'At a time when there are stresses on the economy, we need to know fully the impact of all government decisions.' He predicted $10 billion in compensation claims if the apology were made. It was nonsense then and it is nonsense now. The apology was an important step in Australia's journey of healing and reconciliation, and I urge everyone to return to the words that came to us from the very centre of the continent and the Uluru Statement from the Heart: 'We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.'
          </p>
          <p>
           I urge people to look at the words that are being put forward that make clear the primacy of the parliament. I urge people to have a look at the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, which has legal consequences, speaking about matters that affect
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           differently. I urge people as well and I urge those opposite to listen to the words of the person that this Leader of the Opposition appointed as shadow Attorney-General:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Voice is advisory. It won't be Moses handing down the tablets from the mountain. The parliament will still be the democratic centre of our national life. The parliament will still be supreme in matters of law and policy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Berowra continues to be a powerful advocate for the constitutional change. I say to all Australians: parliaments pass laws, but it is people that make history, and we have an opportunity to advance reconciliation in the last quarter of this year. I sincerely hope and call for Australians to vote yes. (
