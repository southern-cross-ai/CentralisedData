        The karaoke cup fundraiser for the Crackin' Cancer Compassionate Fund was held at the Workers Club recently and was a great success. Over $23,000 was raised to financially help cancer in-patients at

        Jack Leeson turns 10 in May. He is already an accomplished swimmer from Ulmarra Public School. He trains four mornings and two afternoons a week with coaches Jo Clare and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Patterson" rel="nofollow">
         Allan Patterson
        </a>
        at the Grafton Pool. Earlier this year he was named Junior Boy Champion for the Ulmarra and Friends Carnival, the Small Schools Swimming Carnival in Grafton and the District
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSSA" rel="nofollow">
         PSSA
        </a>
        Swimming Carnival. At the district event he broke records in the 200-metre individual medley, the 50-metre freestyle and the 50-metre backstroke. He then competed at the Mid North Coast PSSA Swimming Carnival in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        and the North Coast PSSA Swimming Carnival in Kempsey. Jack has also been competing in the New South Wales Speedo Sprint Series. At the Kempsey event he qualified to travel to Sydney, where he competed in all events, swimming a personal best in all disciplines that he competed in. He has broken nearly all his club's records this year. In his age category he now holds the records for the 50-metre freestyle, the 50-metre backstroke, the 50-metre butterfly, the 100-metre breaststroke, the 100-metre backstroke, the 100-metre butterfly and the 200-metre individual medley. Two of the records were previously held by the 1996-97 World Iron Man Champion, Nathan Meyer, and the 50-metre butterfly record was held by current club President David Moon. This record has stood for 43 years. Jack is certainly a star on the horizon, and I wish him every success.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        . Sam competed at the New South Wales under-18 boys state hockey championships in Sydney in May, and from that they picked a New South Wales schoolboys training squad. That squad then went into a week-long camp in June 2015 in Sydney. The New South Wales schoolboys team then travelled to

        Cody Ensby competed in campdrafting. This event is extremely prestigious. The ABCRA has thousands of members, but they take only the top 25 for the national titles. It is the Olympics of the campdrafting world. Congratulations, Cody.

        James Bertalli currently holds a couple of Australian athletics records, in shotput and discus, for his classification. He hopes to one day represent Australia at the Olympics.

        Stephanie Hutton competed in the New South Wales rowing state championships. In an exciting progression, the team competed for the first time in the state championships, and Stephanie was entered in the individual, double and quad formats in the regatta. This regatta provides an outstanding opportunity for this crew from a small regional town to compete at the highest level within Australia. It is also very exciting for the coaches to see this young team ready to enter the higher standard of competition. Congratulations to Stephanie.

        Alex Dahl, who is a third-year playing rep in netball, attended local carnivals in the lead-up to state age championships, which is a huge event where a lot of districts compete.

        Ella Cooke was selected to represent North East Tennis at the 2015 Queensland junior teams carnival in December last year in Brisbane.
