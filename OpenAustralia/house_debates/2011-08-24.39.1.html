       <p>
        Small business is the font of so much innovation and enterprise and is one of the key drivers in our economy. In Australia there are more than 2.3 million small businesses. The last ABS stats said that the contribution small business makes to the economy, industry value added, is around $300 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Small business though is doing it tough right now. We see that with consumer confidence. We see that with the worst retail figures since the 1960s. We see that as a result of the government's changes to workplace flexibility. In my electorate of Higgins I have 19,524 small businesses. Small businesses employ people. They take risks. They put their money on the line. They make a very important contribution to our economy.

        I would particularly like to congratulate one of the small businesses in my area, the Malvern Hotel, that recently was recognised for its achievement in the National
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHA" rel="nofollow">
         AHA
        </a>
        awards for top hotels. The hotel was recognised as Best Bistro (Metropolitan) and I would particularly like to congratulate the owners,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Price" rel="nofollow">

        and Michael and Susan Burke for their great achievement since taking over this business in 2009. Like so many people in small business they work very hard and it is terrific that they have now been recognised.
