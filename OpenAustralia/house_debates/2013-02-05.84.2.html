       <p>
        This Saturday just past, at four o'clock in the afternoon, some 600 owners of classic cars gathered with their cars in Lilydale to participate in the second annual classic car remembrance cruise to commemorate the anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">

        fires. The drive is the inspiration of two people, Stacey and Troy Kinsmore, in memory of their close friend Kate Ansett and her partner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fisher" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Fisher
        </a>
        , who died at Toolangi on Black Saturday. Last year, the first drive took place to raise awareness and to raise money for the local Healesville Country Fire Authority. The cars gathered at Lilydale industrial estate, at Stacey and Troy's business, before cruising to Healesville via

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose was to reflect, remember and rededicate to the memory of those who lost their lives. You could not drive on that drive, as I did, without reflecting as you drove through the winding roads through Toolangi and down to Healesville. Everyone who participated who paid a registration fee made a practical contribution to fundraising for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        . At the historic Healesville Railway Station many other families came and contributed, as well, as you would expect, to raffles and to donations to the CFA.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a step that Stacey and Troy Kinsmore wanted to take. The first cruise last year, on the third anniversary, was a very big step for them. In the period that followed the Black Saturday fires they knew they wanted to do something to honour the memory of their friends, but it took some time and some healing before they settled on what it was they would do. This is now an institution that will take place every year. It will raise money every year and it will raise community awareness every year. As you know, Speaker, as a fellow member from Melbourne, it was more than 200 Saturdays ago, but of course it feels like last Saturday, even yesterday, for all those affected by the fires.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the privilege of helping Stacey and Troy just a little in the organisations. They deserve congratulations, and I wanted to mention them in the House, along with Wendy Bennett, who conducted the official proceedings. As I said, funds raised go to the local Healesville CFA and also to the Kate Ansett Bushfire Recovery Fund, which Stacey and Troy have established. This was a great local community event, a time to reflect and remember, and I wanted to congratulate them in this House for all they have done and all I know they will do in the years ahead.

         I thank the member. I also, bizarrely, had a constituent who was lost in the fires, and I think we also reflect on that sad time today.
