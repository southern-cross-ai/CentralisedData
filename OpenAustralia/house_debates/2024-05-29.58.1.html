       <p>
        In my electorate of Hasluck, we hear the hollow sound of the opposition across the whole gamut of portfolio areas. We passed a fuel efficiency standard, the coalition opposed it. And all we heard in the member of Dickson's budget was reply was the hollow remark about family cars and utes. We passed real cost-of-living relief for families, including assistance for power bills, and they opposed it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Talk from the opposition leader about inflation rings hollow when he won't support any policies that every expert has said will help to keep inflation down. We put forward legislation to help people into housing, and they opposed it. We gave every Australian taxpayer a tax cut, and the opposition didn't even know what to do. The echoes dance around their hollow party room. Some of them said they'll oppose it, then they said they'll pass it—but you know it's done grudgingly—and then they don't even know if they will keep those tax reforms into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the Albanese Labor government brings it all together and sends the right signals to industry and business with a $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package, where are they? Where is the opposition leader? Having opposed climate change science and opposed setting a net zero target in legislation, they can't see the opportunity to support our country's green energy future.

        The opposition leader's words ring hollow in Hasluck.
