           I would have thought my voice was loud enough when I answered this question before, twice. And the member for Ballarat is within earshot of me. What I said was, in time, when we look back at this, we will say, 'At least the land next to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Western Sydney
           </a>
           airport is Commonwealth owned.' It would cost a lot more in the future, had it not been bought now. In that particular interview, I was also espousing the importance of Western Sydney airport. We are getting on with the job of building Western Sydney airport, something that never would have happened under those opposite—never would have happened.

           <p>
            I will just say to the Deputy Prime Minister that the area he's trying to go to, he can't under this specific question. He really can't. That is precisely why, to my chagrin a lot of the time, the questions from my right have the phrase 'alternative policies' in there. That is what permits it, and this question was very specific and it deals just with the substance of the matter. He needs to be relevant to it.

               The point of order is on direct relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister cannot possibly be directly relevant if he is referring to 2012, because that's not when the Federal Police started investigating. This is about when the Federal Police started investigating, and that is on your watch.
