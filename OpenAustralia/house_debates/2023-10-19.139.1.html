        Today I rise to talk about an event I've had the pleasure to attend many times as members for Scullin—the blessing of the emergency services fleet. It brings together faith leaders and many other community members from across the Whittlesea community to thank and also celebrate emergency services personnel—volunteer and career—who every day risk their lives to save ours and protect our communities. Ahead of what we fear may well be a busy summer season for emergency services personnel, the blessing of the fleet has become a really important tradition in the city of Whittlesea, with personnel from the

        and emergency staff from Whittlesea Council all represented.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Whittlesea" rel="nofollow">
         City of Whittlesea
        </a>
        for their work in ensuring this event continues the tradition of uniting our community and also educating community members, particularly the many community members new not just to the city of Whittlesea but to Australia, on some of the challenges an Australian summer often represents.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is about recognition, too, of the work that our emergency services and volunteer forces do to help our community more broadly. I know that, for many of these services, there's been no reprieve since well before
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
         Black Summer
        </a>
        . They've gone on from those fires through the COVID response, floods and now an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nino" rel="nofollow">
         El Nino
        </a>
        on top of the already demanding tasks of their daily duties. These services, as we all know, rely very heavily on volunteers to sustain the response that's required. It's so important that we acknowledge their work in this chamber because it's their contribution that binds communities together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to particularly acknowledge my friend Ray Rosales. He's been a CFA volunteer in Mernda since 2005. His continued contribution and service to the community, not simply in the CFA, is an inspiration to me and many others and something which deserves to be recognised here.
       </p>

         Blessing of the Fleet
        </a>
        are small but meaningful ways in which we can acknowledge and celebrate the work that all of these people and forces do. I want to recognise the contribution of former councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fry" rel="nofollow">
         John Fry
        </a>
        , a stalwart of the community and a dear friend who first established this tradition 27 years ago. I want to thank John, who was there at Blessing of the Fleet this year, for the work he continues to involve himself in and to recognise that he commenced a very proud and important tradition that continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only does this annual event recognise the work of our emergency services; it's also a celebration of the diverse multifaith network that exists in our community, with representatives of the Baha'i, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian and Hindu faiths coming together, united in their support, sharing their faith traditions in recognition of who we are and what binds us together as a community in safety.
