        I rise to support the Chefs Long Table Lunch Voluntary Organising Committee in Bunbury in my electorate. The Chefs Long Table Lunch is an outstanding community event that has been held every February since 2004. This outstanding community event was the brainchild of Bunbury’s own national award-winning caterer Leonie Kershaw. Not only did Leonie want to provide a showcase for the south-west’s award-winning chefs to use the mostly donated wonderful local and regional food and wines to tempt the now 500 guests who sit down to a fabulous feast under huge marquees on the foreshore in Bunbury overlooking the picturesque waterway of the

        </a>
        but she also wanted to contribute to the many worthwhile community charities.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been two major beneficiaries of the hard-working, dedicated and extremely energetic group of chefs long table volunteers who help Leonie. In 2008, $61,000 went to the very worthwhile South West Women’s Refuge, a non-profit organisation providing sanctuary and positive support to women and children experiencing violence in their family environment. An additional $28,000 went to smaller groups and families in need. In 2007, $46,000 was given to the Val Lishman Health Research Foundation to help fund a research project focused on youth suicide prevention in the south-west. This project launched recently in Bunbury is expected to take 18 months to complete and has been made possible by the $46,000 donated from the Chefs Long Table Lunch of 2007. The local Riding for the Disabled group also received $6,000. Silver Chain received $20,000 for a car for south-west residents in 2006. The 2004-05 donations totalling $14,000 were dedicated to the Bunbury timber jetty.

        The community has embraced this wonderful concept, queuing up for tickets and then bringing their absolute determination to have a great day out as they enjoy the culinary delights, premium wines, live music and dancing on offer. I hope that I have made you all want to come along and share this event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge Leonie Kershaw, the outstanding committee, the chefs who donate their time and talent as well as the veritable army of happy volunteers. Not only do they all combine to provide those attending with a special experience; their efforts and the community support ensure that very deserving local charitable organisations receive the funding they so desperately need.

        I was delighted to see the Chefs Long Table Lunch reach the finals of the 2008 Regional Achievement and Community Awards from a very strong field of nominees from right across regional

        . I congratulate and thank everyone involved and wish the chefs long table group well for the 2009 Chefs Long Table Lunch. I am going to be there.
