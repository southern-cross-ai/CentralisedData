        Today I was privileged to attend the Australian War Memorial's national

        service, where my heart was literally bursting as my region was so ably represented. Firstly, Worimi man Leading Aircraftman Tarryn Roach played the didgeridoo for the ceremony. Then our very own local journalist

        did a magnificent job as master of ceremonies. Well done to you both.

        Remembrance Day is a special time for our country. It's a time for reflecting on our past and asking ourselves collectively what it means to be Australian and what sort of country we want to live in. The reason for its significance lies in the history of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        , where 60,000 Australians perished and a further 156,000 were wounded. It was 102 years ago today that the Armistice was signed, and this day became known later as Remembrance Day. In that terrible conflict, our fledgling democracy, considered by many in Mother England as a colonial outpost, took its place in the wider world as a nation. But we paid a terrible price for that. Many soldiers were Indigenous. Many were immigrants. Many were first-generation Australians whose parents had come to Australia for a new life. They all united and fought for the future, and that future is you and me, us here today, 100-plus years on. We mark the day by wearing the red poppy, which was a common sight on the landscapes of World War I, particularly on the

        .

        In my electorate, our links to Defence are very strong. I am just a couple of kilometres away, as the crow flies, from

        Base Williamtown, the leading jet fighter base for the F-35s here in Australia, and I am particularly proud of the work that is done there. I'd like to take this opportunity to pass on my respects to those who are serving or who have served, both living and deceased. Today our many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        subbranches held ceremonies—with, by necessity, limited numbers—to pay their respects and give their unconditional support to those who risked their lives so that we can live our own as freely as we do. Of course, sending our forces into conflict should not be taken lightly, and the lessons of the past will help guide future decisions. Australia is a peace-loving country, and our aim to assist in fostering peace is one that is admirable. We want a more peaceful world. Take the example of our serving members who are always there to lend their considerable talents and energies to Aussies during drought, floods and fire. Thank you to those reservists who, whilst having a full workload, then go and help fellow Australians in need. That is indeed a wonderful feat as well, and I pay my respects to you too on this Remembrance Day.
