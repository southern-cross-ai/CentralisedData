         I thank the member for his question and I would recommend that if he, for whatever reason, was distracted when the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         gave her answer earlier in question time he studies the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         . What he will find from that
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         and what she confirmed to the parliament is that our new investments in elective surgery are ensuring people can get elective surgery: eye surgery, knee surgery and the like. We have seen more procedures undertaken than the minister thought was possible when she announced the funds. She had announced that 25,000 would be done and in fact 27,000 or more have been done and she is running in front of time. Since this government came to office we have invested an additional $1 billion in health for a set of purposes and an additional $600 million for another set of purposes. As the minister indicated, these have been tied to outcomes. Importantly, some of the outcomes that they have been tied to have been these elective surgery procedures.

           meeting on Saturday, stands in stark contrast to the record of the Liberal Party, where the man sitting next to him used to wander around giving ‘rock-solid, ironclad guarantees’ only to have to back down on them because the things that were said to the Australian people at election time were never honoured by the Liberal Party in government. This government has taken a different approach. You sent your then minister for health out to give Australians a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee when they were voting and broke that promise.

             The response is relative to the question. There may be a little too much debate in it but that is allowable under the precedents of this place. I would remind the

              make the simple point that in health as well as in other areas this is a government that keeps its word. This is a government that delivers on its commitments. This is a government that is putting in place the long-term foundation stones of reform. This is a government that is responding decisively to the global financial crisis.
