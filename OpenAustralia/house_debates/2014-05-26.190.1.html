       <p>
        On Saturday, 24 May 2014, I had the privilege of attending as the vice-patron at the opening ceremony of the new indoor arena for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Valley
        </a>
        branch of the Riding for the Disabled Association, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to providing therapeutic and recreational benefits through equestrian activities to over 1,000 of the estimated 390,000 people in WA who have some level of disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the construction of the Swan Valley indoor arena, this worthy service will now be able to be offered all year round to its members through a combination of fundraising via Movies by Burswood and a $55,000 grant offered by Lotterywest. Sufficient funds were raised and the arena was able to go through to the planning phase and then to the actual construction. I extend my thanks to these two organisations for facilitating this terrific outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Special thanks should also be extended to Frana Jones, who volunteered for the unenviable position of project manager and whose persistence allowed the project to succeed. Thanks also to Graham Betteridge, who overcame a problem with the building, when he volunteered his time and services as builder. Thanks should also be extended to all the patrons, parents, carers, volunteers and contractors who got behind the project and assisted in the arena's construction. Particular thanks go to Jan and Matthew Pavlinovich, who were instrumental in the process. From my previous dealings with them, I know that they make frequent, very substantial and very positive contributions to the community of Pearce. I am grateful for the ongoing work that they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day itself was a great success and gave me the opportunity to meet with some very inspiring people, such as Ella, one of the riders who benefits from the therapeutic services provided by the association. I commend the association and the work they do.
