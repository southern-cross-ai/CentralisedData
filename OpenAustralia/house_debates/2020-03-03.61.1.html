        My question is again to the Prime Minister. Why has the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        repeatedly told the parliament and the Australian people the decision on the sports rorts project was made on 4 April when the Audit Office has found the lists of sports rorts projects attached to that brief kept changing until hours after the election was called on 11 April? Isn't it absurd to claim a decision was made on 4 April when the list determining which projects were funded and which missed out was still changing a week later?

         The member has raised comments and statements I've made in this House regarding this specific matter regarding 4 April. Let me say what I have said in this House. The evidence provided today was that Sport Australia advised the committee this morning that they received a brief from Senator McKenzie dated 4 April 2019. That was the evidence. That's what I said. From a later question: the authority approving those projects was signed, dated 4 April 2019. The testimony today from Sport Australia—another response—was that they received a brief from Senator McKenzie dated 4 April 2019. It was authorised by the minister 4 April 2019. That's when the approval was given. I've been very clear in this House about when that authority was provided for that brief, which was on 4 April. I don't think it can be any clearer.

        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition seeks to come to the dispatch box and treat question time as smear time, to treat question time as baseless assertion time. The Australian people can see through a Leader of the Opposition who is so desperate that he has to resort to smears and assertions when the real issues that Australians are facing today—

                   That's fair enough! What we're seeing from the Leader of the Opposition today is that they haven't come into this place and addressed the big issues for Australian people. Yesterday in this House members on this side came into this chamber and wanted to know what the government's response was to address the very serious issue of coronavirus in this country. There was not one question from the opposition about that.

                     No. I want to make it clear. I said that the Prime Minister 'was' being relevant.

                      You gave an earlier ruling saying precisely why at that point the Prime Minister was being relevant. What he's going to now are issues entirely outside of that ruling that you gave.

                       The Prime Minister is entitled to compare and contrast, which he's doing. And, as I said earlier, the question had some preamble in it. It also had what I'd call an element of character attack, for a better term, and that's not uncommon. I'm not going to try and make question time something that it's not. But I'm going to keep hearing from the Prime Minister in response to the question.

                        Our government are going to keep focusing on the issues that seriously matter to the Australian people. Whether it's the coronavirus, whether it's responding to the bushfire crisis, whether it's dealing with the drought, we're prepared for the budget. We're getting skills into Australian employees so they can grow our economy and we bounce back strongly—whether it's the plastic summit or getting emissions down or providing certainty in our electricity system around the country. Those opposite want to come in here and engage in political smears. I know they're used to doing that in their own caucus against each other, but if they're not interested in the serious issues confronting the Australian people there is no wonder why the Australian people have no confidence in the opposition or this Leader of the Opposition.
