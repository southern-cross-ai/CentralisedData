        I meet a wide range of people as a local MP. I would like to share the story of one of them with you. Nancy Pittman Outten, now living in Rosewood, formerly of Raceview, is a constituent who has a daughter diagnosed with auditory processing disorder. Now 13 years old, Holly Pittman Outten has just started high school at Rosewood State High School. Nancy and her husband, Gary, first became aware that things were not quite right with Holly when she started prep. Nancy talks about how, at a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Jack's" rel="nofollow">
         Hungry Jack's
        </a>
        birthday party for Holly, Holly became withdrawn and overwhelmed by all the noise and activity, despite being very excited about the party in the lead-up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later, Holly's prep teacher pointed out that Holly had low muscle tone and some problems with fine motor skills and suggested that she repeat prep before embarking on grade 1. Nancy admits to having felt frustrated with the teacher because she was not ready to hear a report like that, and neither was Gary. I think every parent can relate to or empathise with the struggle Nancy and Gary had in the early years of Holly's childhood. Nancy spoke to me of her frustration in trying to get the help she knew Holly needed. She spoke of the struggle they had getting Holly to do her homework. And she spoke of the day-to-day difficulties of parenting a child with an undiagnosed learning disorder.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am told that auditory processing disorder is not easy to detect and diagnose. In 1954, the first real research into the disorder was carried out, but it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that research into the disorder was done in any depth. A simple definition of auditory processing disorder is 'what we do with what we hear'. I am informed that the experience of auditory processing disorder may include: distraction; high sensitivity to loud or sudden noise; difficulty spelling, reading and/or writing; poor comprehension; and disorganisation and forgetfulness. These are apparently just some of the symptoms of this disorder.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eventually, Nancy and Gary heard about auditory processing disorder when Holly was about seven years of age. They had not heard of it before, and the all-knowing, all-powerful Google told them, they thought, that it was dyslexia. Auditory processing disorder is formally diagnosed and assessed by an audiologist. I would like to read you a comment made by Nancy at the time of Holly's diagnosis:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The audiology report confirmed Holly has auditory processing disorder. Everything that was stored away in the back of my mind came flooding forward: can't remember spelling words; can't follow multiple instructions; reluctant to participate in class discussions; unable to do the work; doesn't understand money; being overwhelmed at her birthday party—everything I'd noticed or been told about Holly now had a reason behind it.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear from Nancy's comment that Holly's diagnosis was something of a light-bulb moment for Nancy and for Gary. However, the struggles continue for Holly, Nancy, Gary and their family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nancy told me how connecting and communicating with other parents of children with auditory processing disorder through Facebook helped her to deal with the disorder. This turned out to be no ordinary support group. This group of parents, from right across the world, decided to pool their resources and recount their own stories in a book with a view to helping other parents and sufferers of auditory processing disorder. The book,
        <i>
         Same Journey Different Paths
        </i>
        ,was published last year and gives a comprehensive and helpful overview to anyone interested in the disorder. Because auditory processing disorder varies in severity and symptoms, the reader will get a broad outlook and is bound to find help and advice from at least one of the contributor's stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Nancy and her family discovered, half the battle was finding out what was actually wrong with Holly. They knew things were not as they should be but were floundering in the dark in terms of what was actually going on with her. I am an advocate of people who are proactive—of people who, when they see that something needs to be done, get in and do it. I see this trait in a lot of parents I meet in the electorate of Blair. People who have a child who is ill or who is living with disability are some of the most remarkable people I have ever encountered. I commend these parents, and I commend Nancy on her tenacity, courage and determination. I wish her, Gary and the whole family, especially Holly, well.
