        I take this opportunity to thank a local legend for his contribution to our community. My good friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Jordan" rel="nofollow">
         Ray Jordan
        </a>
        has been volunteering with the Mount Druitt Senior Citizens and Welfare Association for over a quarter of a century. Under his leadership it has become one of the best associations in the area. Whether it is for a game of bowls or bingo or just sitting back for one of Ray's famous teas, the club has opened its door to many seniors in our community and offered them a friendly and comforting environment. He has also on many occasions been kind and allowed us to use the club rooms to accommodate the 100-plus attendees who come along for my annual seniors forum. Another annual occasion I love being involved in with the club is their

        celebration, particularly getting to see some of the entertainment the club puts on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray's work doesn't stop with the seniors. He has received countless awards and has helped with so many activities and events for the

        , Softball New South Wales, parents and citizens associations, and various local sporting organisations. Aged 87 Ray recently stepped down as president, but in true Ray style he is still around continuing his great work for the club. He was recently recognised by my friend the member for McMahon for his efforts at an event that was held in the McMahon electorate. Ray, thank you for everything you have done and continue to do to make such a positive impact on our community.
