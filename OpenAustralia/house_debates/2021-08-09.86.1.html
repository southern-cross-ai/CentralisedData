        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his press conference on Thursday, where he said five times in 50 seconds that ministers made the decisions on the commuter car parks program. If the Prime Minister was telling the truth last week, how does he explain the letters he signed on 11 January and 10 April 2019, in which he provided funding for 38 car park projects?

        <p>
         I confirm again what I said at the press conference the other day—it is quite normal. The Prime Minister, through the 'hunting licence process' that members opposite may be familiar with, through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC" rel="nofollow">
          ERC
         </a>
         process, signs off on a whole range of recommendations that are made within their authority by ministers. That's the normal process. This program goes to something very important. This program, that we have supported—and I will quote you someone who was very supportive of these projects, saying:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … public transport isn't just about the train line or bus route itself. It's also about the surrounding infrastructure that makes it work for local residents. That is why we are committed to upgrading parking facilities here at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_Hill" rel="nofollow">
          Mango Hill
         </a>
         Station and at transport hubs across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was from the member for Grayndler—the member for Grayndler. The Labor Party comes into this place and seeks to deride a program that they themselves have supported. But I will ask the minister if he wishes to add to my answer.

         <p>
          I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to add to the answer. As the Prime Minister absolutely accurately said, there is a yawning paradox here because the Labor Party, at the last election, committed to a park-and-ride fund and committed to building commuter car parks at

          <p>
           I just say to the minister: the Prime Minister did briefly compare the policies, but the question didn't ask about alternatives. In fact, it didn't—
          </p>
          <p>
           An honourable member
           <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">

           —
          </p>
          <p>
           Hang on—I don't even need supportive interjections; they're unhelpful, too. It didn't even ask about the merits of spending money in a particular way. It specifically went to quotes of the Prime Minister or the number of times he'd said something, and asked him to explain how letters were signed off in a particular way. So it is very narrow.

            What the Prime Minister has said is entirely consistent with what the Auditor-General's report has said, which makes it clear that the decisions made here are within the authority of the minister and within the authority of the Commonwealth government. Page 38 of the Auditor-General's report says:

           <p class="italic">
            Under the Infrastructure Investment Program arrangements, the

              A point of order on relevance. The question went to the Prime Minister signing letters on 11 January and 10 April 2019, approving funding for 38 projects, and the contradiction there with his comments last week, where he said five times that it wasn't his decision.
