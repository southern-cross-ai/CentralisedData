        A very important matter is about to come before Canterbury Bankstown Council, and that is the issue of the former Bankstown Council's plans for tens of thousands of additional high-rise units to be built across the Bankstown area. This plan must not go ahead. It will have a very negative impact on Padstow, Revesby,

        </a>
        and Pananiaâ€”tens of thousands of additional high-rise units.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the recent council election, all councillors who were elected, whether they were Liberal, Labor or Greens, said they were against this plan. Well, there's a very simple solution: get rid of the plan. Start with another plan, because this plan will change the southern Bankstown area in a way which cannot be undone. It will change these suburbs for the worse, for the long run, and it must not go ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the case that this plan is required by the state government. It is not the case that this plan must go ahead. It is entirely possible for this plan to be withdrawn and for a new plan to be submitted, and that is what must happen. It's not about politics. It's not about what political party the councillors happen to be from. It's about the long-term future of our area, and all of the councillors need to step up, withdraw this plan, go back to the drawing board and preserve the character of our area.
