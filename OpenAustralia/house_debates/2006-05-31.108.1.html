       <p>
        Last Saturday I was delighted to attend the Lions changeover dinner for district 201N1. At that function I was presented with a hearing dog tie by Lion Harry Mills of the Nambucca

        , and I am wearing that very fine garment today. I would commend the tie to members on both this side of the House and the other side of the House. I think the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Ports" rel="nofollow">

        could enjoy the benefit of such a fine tie as the hearing dog tie! Most people are aware of the great work of our seeing eye dogs, but the work of hearing dogs is less well known. Hearing dogs perform a similar function for the hearing impaired to that that seeing eye dogs perform for the blind. They alert their owner, for instance, if the phone rings or if there is someone at the door. They are a companion for people who live in a silent world and provide an increased level of self-reliance and safety for the hearing impaired. I would like to congratulate Lion Harry Mills and his fellow Lions for the great work they do in supporting this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our service clubs perform a vital function in communities around the world, and Lions certainly live up to their motto ‘We serve’. Almost 1.35 million Lions in 45,000 clubs across 197 countries around the world are achieving great things internationally and at a local level. For example, the eyeglass recycling program is conducted through the Lions Eyeglass Recycling Centres and involves the collection of used eyeglasses. They are cleaned, repaired, sorted by prescription and distributed in developing countries. The Lions SightFirst grants fight preventable and reversible blindness by building hospitals and clinics and by training doctors, nurses and other health professionals. The program also involves the distribution of medicine and the raising of awareness of eye disease. Without the gift of sight, many people in countries which do not have the sort of social security system we have in this country would struggle to survive. Blindness could well be a formula for starvation in many developing countries. I believe that this makes programs such as SightFirst all the more important.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Lions are achieving locally through programs such as the hearing dog program and internationally through programs such as SightFirst. Lionism has achieved a great deal in just under 100 years. I wish the incoming governor of district 201N1, Peter Veryard, and his executive well for the year ahead. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the great work by outgoing district governor Judy Hedges for her tireless work over the last year. I also wish to offer my condolences to her on the tragic loss of her husband, Terry, a greatly respected member of our community.
