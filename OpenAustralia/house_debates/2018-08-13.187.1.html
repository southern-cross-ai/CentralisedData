        As with many electorates in the state of Victoria, the great electorate of Isaacs is changing following the recent redrawing of electoral boundaries. I'm so pleased to welcome to the Isaacs community residents of Cheltenham,

         Dingley Village

        , Heatherton, Highett and Moorabbin. I have been out and about in the new parts of Isaacs, holding street stalls and mobile offices in Cheltenham, Dingley, Highett and Moorabbin. As well, I attended an excellent community forum about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        rollout in Cheltenham last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am passionate about Isaacs and have enjoyed every event that I have attended in the new parts of the electorate. The first weekend after the new boundaries were released, I was doorknocking and held a street stall in Dingley Village and Cheltenham and met some wonderful people. I have attended the Dingley farmers market, and will again this Saturday. I've barracked for the mighty Highett and Dingley Village footy clubs and met teachers and students at schools across these suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already, I have visited the Cheltenham, Highett and Dingley community centres, each one in the heart of the communities that they represent. Thank you to the managers of these centres—Arna, Melanie, Pam and Marion—for your hospitality. I look forward to spending much time advocating for the needs of the communities that you help every day. Isaacs is a fantastic community and I welcome every resident new to it. I promise you that I will always fight for your needs and work to make our great community even better.
