        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the importance of ensuring the 457 visas program acts as a supplement to and not a substitute for Australian workers? What are the risks associated with taking an alternative approach?

         I thank the member for his question. As we come toward Christmas, Australians will be thinking about this parliamentary year. They will be thinking about the performance of the Leader of the Opposition. They will be talking about whether they believe that this Leader of the Opposition is a trustworthy individual and whether his character determines if he could be properly considered to be the leader of this country. You know what, Mr Speaker? I think we have demonstrated at every turn during this parliamentary year that this Leader of the Opposition, on every test, fails the basic question of trust. He says outside of this parliament that he is supporting Australian workers, that he wants to put Australian workers first, yet we find out that, when he was the employment minister, he signed a secret deal with fast-food companies, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
          McDonald's
         </a>
         , to allow hundreds of workers in to displace Australian workers. And, worse than that, he then said, to provide some sort of cover, that: no, no—he was bringing workers in to work in the mines; that it was the mining boom; 457 worker numbers spiked because he was bringing workers in to work in the mines. But he was found out, and he failed the character test yet again.
        </p>
        <p>
         The difficulty is that it goes beyond that for this Leader of the Opposition because he is also, as we found out this week, signing other deals. He is signing other deals and he is consorting, as it turns out, through his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         links, with criminals and thugs—people that have been convicted of criminal offences. And that is the reality of this Leader of the Opposition.

              The minister is reflecting on the Leader of the Opposition. The practice and the standing orders are very clear. It is not a question of what the minister might think to be the case. Members cannot reflect on each other in this chamber and they cannot reflect on senators. The minister will withdraw.

                 </a>
                 has donated $11 million to the Labor Party—$11 million. There are many people who sit behind this Leader of the Opposition who are affiliated very closely with the CFMEU, and there are many people who would call themselves a friend of this Leader of the Opposition who are very intricately involved in the senior levels of the CFMEU. I will let the Australian public make their own judgement about this Leader of the Opposition. But we have seen, when it comes to 457 visas, and when it comes to this leader saying before the election that he would be on a unity ticket with this government in relation to border protection matters: you cannot take him at his word. There is nothing that this Leader of the Opposition says that he truly believes in, and he will say anything at all to the Australian people just to take this office, and he is not worthy, on any test, to become Prime Minister of this country.
