        , AM, was declared WA's Senior Australian of the Year on Saturday. Great lost both legs to landmine while on voluntary service in Vietnam in 1970. He refused to be defeated by these injuries and became a powerful advocate for both the proper treatment of veterans and that disabled. Graham also showed that he would not be defined by and confined to those issues. He championed the principles of fairness and opportunity for all and was elected as a Labor member to the WA

        in 1983. He served as minister for racing, gaming and sport and then as police minister, and was hugely respected for his work in those portfolios.

        When I first entered parliament he was the Labor leader in the Legislative Council, and I so appreciated his wise advice. He then went on to serve in this place as a most popular member for Cowan for nine years. Graham is the President of the WA branch of the
