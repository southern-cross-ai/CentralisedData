        I take this opportunity to wish everyone in the Greenway electorate and around Australia a very happy Holi. The official date of Holi is 23 March but, as we know, with these fantastic festivals the festivities continue either side of the specified date. Holi is well known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Colours" rel="nofollow">
         Festival of Colours
        </a>
        . A fantastic expression of Australia's multiculturalism is that Holi is not only celebrated by people of specific ethnicities or religions but has become very much a community celebration. I would like to quote from an official Indian website which I think provides a good summary of what Holi is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When Lord Krishna was young, he envied the fair skin of Radha. To express his envy, Krishna rubbed color onto Radha's face. This act of showering another person with color is now considered to be an expression of friendship and love. This story forms the well-known tradition of showering other people with color during Holi celebrations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The origins of these festivities are in the timeless traditions of victories of our better selves and good triumphing over evil.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note also that this festival is celebrated right around the world. It does have its roots in Hinduism, as I alluded to, but is celebrated by people of all faiths right across India, the Subcontinent and around the globe. As an example, I had a look at some of the celebrations taking place in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        ; they run for pages and pages. To bring this back home, on Sunday we had the Festival of Holi at Blacktown Showground. I would like to congratulate the organisers of that event, particularly Mr Bikram Cheema, whose Festival of Colour last year won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blacktown City Council
        </a>
        community event of the year. I am sure he is in the running again this year, because that two-day festival was so well attended and so much fun was being had. I was particularly delighted to welcome the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon.

        , to that event. He had a great time, and I am sure I will have a great time, along with many others who are attending other festivals of Holi this weekend, including this Saturday the 20th at the Plaza Park in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ponds" rel="nofollow">
         The Ponds
        </a>
        , which is being organised by the Council of Indian Australians in conjunction with The Ponds Kellyville Ridge Community Association, and also the Holi Festival of Colour taking place at Gladstone Street,

        . Lastly, for anyone tuning in. I look forward to welcoming everyone to my

        </a>
        morning tea next Monday, 21 March at 10 am at The Ponds Community Hub. This is an opportunity for people to bring a plate of food to share and celebrate our harmonious wonderful multicultural Australia.
