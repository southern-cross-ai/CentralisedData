       <p>
        I want to tell the parliament about a terrific new program in my community called Logan Together. Among the many fantastic programs that operate in my community, I am particularly excited about the program Logan Together. The philosophy is: 'Every child, every opportunity'. It aims to pull together all the resources in our community—our tremendous support groups, our experienced leaders and our committed and devoted community workers—to improve the chances of Logan kids.

        results of kids so that they get up near the state and national averages. Getting this right is, of course, in the children's best interests but also in the long-term interests of our community.

        , has been a great choice of leader for this project, and he will be well supported by his team and by all three levels of government. I want to take this opportunity to wish Matthew's team at Logan Together all the best. I think I can say on behalf of everyone in our community that we want their project to be successful, and when it does succeed it will be a model for effective social policy across the nation and it will show again that our community in
