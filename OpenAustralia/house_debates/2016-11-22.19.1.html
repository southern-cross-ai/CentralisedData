       <p>
        Today I rise to congratulate Mr Russell Lewis, a local paramedic in my electorate of Lindsay, on his recent and well-deserved retirement from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Ambulance Service
        </a>
        of New South Wales. Russell retired on the same day I got my new job in this place and he says that I was his gift in retirement. It was a real honour to attend his retirement party as my first official public event as the member for Lindsay.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell called time on his distinguished career of caring for people after 39 years of service to our community, working out of the Colyton branch of the New South Wales ambulance service. During that time he has seen every aspect of being on the frontline of emergency health care, including significant trauma and suffering. With every job, he has sought to help those most in need. He also boasts an incredible count of 60 babies delivered on the side of a road! Each of those families and thousands of others who have been assisted by Russell—myself included—are undoubtedly indebted to him and to his work. Russell was the first responder when I snapped my

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in an attempt, perhaps misguided, to showcase my basketball skills during the election campaign. Russell and his wife, Kay, have recently purchased a motorhome, and I wish them and their children all the best as they enjoy their retirement travelling and spending much more time with their grandchildren.
