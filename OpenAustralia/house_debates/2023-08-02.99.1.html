        Australians, particularly in rural and regional communities? And why is direct consultation with First Nations people so important in helping to narrow that digital divide?

         I thank the member for Solomon for his question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_inclusion" rel="nofollow">
          Digital inclusion
         </a>
         is central to the Albanese government's delivery of a more informed, connected and resilient nation. However, while digital inclusion is improving on average, there remains a considerable gap when it comes to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         inclusion, according to the latest Australian Digital Inclusion Index. The gap is even more pronounced in remote and very remote First Nations communities. Closing The Gap target 17 aims to achieve equal levels of digital inclusion between First Nations and non-First Nations Australians by 2026. But, make no mistake, it is a significant challenge, particularly because previous attempts to close the gap have failed to respond to the needs of First Nations Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         A recent landmark research project mapping the digital gap, undertaken through deep engagement with 12 remote First Nations communities, revealed the true nature of the gap, with shocking assessments of the realities on the ground and the failure of legacy approaches. Positive and measurable improvements require genuine consultation, and this is what I've heard directly from First Nations leaders and communities from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Palm Island
         </a>
         to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Augusta" rel="nofollow">
          Port Augusta
         </a>
         and Darwin, where, last week, I launched our First Nations Digital Inclusion Plan, a framework that focuses government efforts around the three pillars of access, affordability and ability. Importantly, it commits us to serious, ongoing dialogue with First Nations communities about how to achieve target 17.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consistent with that approach, the government established the First Nations Digital Inclusion Advisory Group earlier this yearâ€”experienced First Nations industry experts, chaired by Dot West
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
          OAM
         </a>
         . The group is highlighting barriers to access, including high costs for prepaid services and poor digital literacy that's preventing First Nations communities from being able to enjoy the benefits of being online. Past co-investment programs have not achieved the right outcomes because they generally assumed a one-size-fits-all approach. When you ask First Nations communities what they need, whether it's connectivity, affordability or digital literacy barriers, you get more targeted and effective approaches and a more cost-effective use of taxpayers' money.
        </p>
        <p>
         Digital inclusion is critical to economic and social opportunities, including access to health, education, financial and government services, and that's what the Voice can achieve across all portfolio areas: positive engagement with First Nations communities from around the country and getting the best outcomes. There is no sign that old approaches are succeeding, but, at least in the communications portfolio, there's every sign that, by acting in response to genuine consultation, we can make all the difference.
