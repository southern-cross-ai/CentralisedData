        Much is said about the rising youth unemployment rate in my electorate of Paterson. It's an important issue and one that I consider among my top priorities. However, I believe it's important that in addition to seeking solutions for our young people, we take the time to celebrate their talents and achievements. It gives me great pride and pleasure to stand before you today and share with you my utter respect for the performing arts talent of the young people of Paterson.

        Last Tuesday I was treated to a display that left me inspired and full of hope for our young people. I was among 1,000 guests given the joy of watching students from the Lakeside Learning Community of schools share their talents on stage during 'Showcase,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Imagine" rel="nofollow">
         Just Imagine
        </a>
        '. Performers across the two-evenings event, which was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrawang_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Irrawang High School
        </a>
        , ranged from early primary years through to the later secondary stages. Cast members were drawn from the student bodies of Irrawang High and Medowie, Wirreanda, Grahamstown and Irrawang public schools. The musical, theatrical and artistic talents of the students were enhanced by professional lighting and sound. It was a fabulous experience for performers, parents and, simply, lovers of the arts. We have so many reasons to be proud of our young people and to be full of hope for their futures. Well done kids! Outstanding!
