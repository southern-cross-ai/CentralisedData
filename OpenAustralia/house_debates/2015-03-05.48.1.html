       <p>
        Yesterday, members from all sides of the House joined together in this place for a debate about making the prevention of family violence a national priority. It was parliament at its best. We told stories instead of spruiking talking points. We sought to challenge the status quo rather than score political points.

        The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the need for a national crisis summit to bring the voices of front-line service providers, advocates and survivors to the front of the political debate about the way forward. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave a powerful speech, naming the far too many women who have been killed already this year. The member for Pearce spoke passionately about his time as a

        and his efforts in trying to convince victims of sexual assault and violence to take their allegations to trial. The member for Jagajaga spoke about the impact that working in Canberra's first women's refuge as a young woman has had on her career in the years since. The member for Griffith spoke about all the women that have to go to court alone to seek protection for themselves and their children, and the gender inequality that exists at the heart of family violence. The member for Ryan spoke about Australia's efforts to help prevent the astonishing levels of violence against women in

        , to our north. I spoke about learning from advocates and service providers about this issue after a member of my own community was killed in horrific and public circumstances in April of last year. We all agree that addressing family violence is a national priority. Let us make sure that our actions match our words.
