        While the Knights' win was a highlight in my week, so too was the briefing those of us in the captain's box received from Professor Nathan Towney, Pro Vice-Chancellor Indigenous, Strategy and Leadership at the University of Newcastle. The weekend's games were part of the

        . It is committed to reconciliation and to its responsibility as educator in this process. The university has an outstanding track record in Indigenous education and research and is a national leader in Indigenous engagement. A total of 4.6 per cent of its students are Indigenous, the highest percentage of any university in the country. A total of 2.4 per cent of its staff are Indigenous, the highest percentage of any university in Australia. Newcastle has graduated more than 110 Indigenous medical students, the highest number in the country. It has graduated more Indigenous teachers than any other university in Australia. The uni has three pathway programs for Indigenous students.

The institute champions academically enriching and culturally affirming education across its campuses.
