       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate the Hackham West R-7 School in my electorate for their commitment to helping people with leukaemia through the World's Greatest Shave. This was brought to my attention by a parent at the school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Creedon" rel="nofollow">
         John Creedon
        </a>
        , and I particularly mention Mr James Reid's year 6/7 class at Hackham West R-7 School who raised close to $3,000 for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        , more than doubling their original goal of $1,000. All the students in the 6/7 class either coloured their hair or shaved their hair, with some of the teachers and parents also getting into the spirit. Mr Reid said, 'I am immensely proud of the group of kids who are in the area of disadvantage having big hearts to raise money for people in great need.' I pay special tribute to one of the girls, Emily, who was especially brave for shaving off her very long hair to raise money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Reid's year is one of many teams around Australia who are doing fantastic work to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. The World's Greatest Shave raises funds for the Leukaemia Foundation's important work providing free and practical emotional support. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Reid who is an example of a teacher who puts in great effort for his class, not just in the teaching but also in ensuring that kids have an understanding of what it is to contribute to society. So congratulations to all the kids in the 6/7 class at Hackham West R-7 School, Mr Reid, Mr Creedon and everyone involved.
