       <p>
        I wish to raise my concerns today in the House about the plans that the Queensland Labor government had to introduce laws that would change the structure of and access to religious education in Queensland public schools. I congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the honourable member for Curtin, for her similar views expressed in a very appropriate media release today.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is good to see that widespread concern about these proposed changes, including from Premier Beattie’s own backbench, has resulted today in the proposed changes being withdrawn for now. However, there remains a concern that the Queensland Labor government are determined to introduce the laws in future. Why they remain so unwavering in the face of so much opposition remains a significant concern to all Queenslanders and other Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposals announced by Queensland Premier Beattie meant that any organised religious group—provided that it is not political—would have been able to send representatives into our schools to teach their beliefs. I must say that I agree with the sentiments of Christian leaders in general that this would have opened the door to a raft of unacceptable problems. I find it quite personally incredible that someone as astute as the Premier seems to remain totally oblivious to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal minister for education has pointed out today that the proposed wider definition of allowable teachings would include ‘religious or other belief’. There have been concerns that the changes would allow cultish groups to bring instruction to our young and impressionable. I place on record also that some members of the community have expressed concern that Satanism and witchcraft, as a result of these changes, would legally have been allowed to be taught in Queensland schools. These are concerns that continue to escape the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        To top it off, the thing that makes this whole issue even more concerning is that the Premier decided to announce these changes on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Saturday
        </a>
        , the day before Easter. Premier Beattie recently demonstrated a lack of understanding of the concept of the Anzac spirit, suggesting that one of his backbenchers travelling to Thailand to visit another backbencher who was suffering personal issues was on a par with the sacrifices made by our diggers in the trenches at Gallipoli. Now he is demonstrating an equal lack of understanding on the true meaning of Easter.

        must understand the importance and fundamental nature of a Christian belief system in our society. The laws of this country, the character and stability of this country and the character of a significant proportion of our greatest leaders all have their foundations in the fundamental beliefs of the Christian religion. And there is a simple reason: it works. We should be encouraging increased adherence to biblical principles. We should not be introducing laws that increase the accessibility of alternate philosophies that make it easier for unacceptable beliefs to be taught.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Queensland education system currently offers religious education for all students. Parents, if they desire, are able to formally request that their children not attend. Under the Beattie plan, children would automatically have no access to religious education, with parents having to make a written request if they wish for their children to attend. This means that the children of those parents who do not normally show a great deal of interest to religious and moral teachings will miss out. In the

         </a>
        </i>
        both the Catholic and the Pentecostal churches raised their concerns. Their fears include that these changes are part of a ‘gradual phasing out of religious education in schools’.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge the Premier not to steer Queensland on a journey down this unacceptable path and to drop this dangerous proposal permanently. This is a serious matter, and while it is good news today that the proposed changes have been withdrawn for now, it is important that these changes are never allowed to be introduced and implemented on a more permanent basis. I urge honourable members on both sides of the House who hail from the state of Queensland to contact the Premier of Queensland to advise him of the gravity of this situation. Happily, what has happened at the present time is that the government of Queensland sought to introduce unacceptable changes that would have undermined the standard and availability of Christian education in Queensland schools. What we have seen is a community outcry. We have seen members, even of the Queensland government party, objecting to these proposed changes. What we have seen today is a backflip. What we want is a new government in the state of Queensland.
