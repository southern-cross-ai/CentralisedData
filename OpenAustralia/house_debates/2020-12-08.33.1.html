        In January 2016 my community in WA was devastated by the Yarloop and Waroona bushfires. Across the region over 60,000 hectares of land was burnt, over 160 homes were destroyed and two lives tragically were lost. The township of Yarloop was devastated. In

        some residents were evacuated from the beach by boat. The disaster was compounded by the destruction and failure of telecommunications infrastructure. This left many residents without means of communication. Much of Canning, and indeed Forrest, is bushfire prone. Residents prepare for it and our volunteer firefighters work and train throughout the year so they are ready for the next season.

        The Morrison government is also stepping up. Recognising that most reception losses were caused by power outages during emergencies, the government has announced the $18 million Mobile Network Hardening Program. Under this program 467 mobile base stations around the country will be upgraded with battery backup power. I'm pleased to say that two of these towers will be in Canning, situated near Waroona and Dwellingup. The Waroona tower will service areas directly impacted by those fires in 2016. Dwellingup, the historic timbre town nestled in the heart of the dense

        , is also a worthy recipient. This investment will allow mobile phone towers to keep operating for at least 12 hours after the power goes out. The upgrades will make a significant difference for these communities, particularly in the critical early stages of future fires.
