        The future of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Wide Bay
        </a>
        is all about jobs in manufacturing—not in the old-school mass-production of labour-intensive goods but in the manufacturing of high-quality innovative products that can only be made by skilled Australian workers using state-of-the-art technology. In Wide Bay, with the support of $28 million, the Australian government has teamed up with Rheinmetall NIOA Munitions. This forging facility is taking shape rapidly. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNM" rel="nofollow">
         RNM
        </a>
        project is restoring Australia's sovereign capability in this critically important area, supporting our defence capability and creating around 100 ongoing jobs in the Maryborough area.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're also seeing innovation in the timber manufacturing sector, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTM" rel="nofollow">
         DTM
        </a>
        Timber opening a new production line in Maryborough for laminating timber products. The new equipment will enable the production of construction beams, posts, stair treads and flooring using shorter cuts of timber left over from DTM Timber's existing processing facility, turning waste into useful products. This is good news for the local economy and the environment. It reduces our reliance on imported timber and overseas suppliers, which is more important than ever as we recover from COVID-19. This $2.2 million project received around $1.1 million through the Australian government's Regional Jobs and Investment program. It has already created six jobs throughout construction and 10 permanent positions, and will support more ongoing jobs for years to come.

        In Gympie, Nolan Meats injected $197 million into the Wide Bay economy last year through the procurement of cattle, and they employ more than one per cent of all people in Gympie. This is a 100 per cent family owned company. It's been in the region for more than 60 years, and they have a strong tradition of giving back to the community. They have their eyes firmly on the future, with some incredible tech at their meat processing facility. It was great to join with the Australian government's minister for agriculture and the Nolan family to officially open the $18 million expansion, which is creating new opportunities for local jobseekers, producers and export market chain suppliers. The Australian government has committed almost $5 million, through the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, to this valuable project. It is already showing results—putting pay packets in the pockets of many hundreds of families around the local area, and supporting jobs for so many others.
