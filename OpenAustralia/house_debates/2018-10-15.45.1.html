        No doubt, like most Australians—like the residents of Eden-Monaro and, no doubt, the residents of Indi, as I see the member for Indi in the chamber here today—the good voters of Wentworth, who are being asked to cast their ballots on Saturday, would have been shocked and appalled to hear the comments of the member for New England this morning calling on the abandonment of the

There will be 5,000 jobs in Eden-Monaro based on that project, and many jobs in the member for Indi's electorate in building the transmission lines as well. This Prime Minister needs to tell the people of Wentworth that if he sticks with this—
