        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. How is the Albanese Labor government ensuring the

         I thank the member for Makin for his question and for his fierce advocacy for the defence of this nation. Last week's announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister and myself was the most consequential announcement for the surface fleet of the Navy since World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

         . Our plan more than doubles the number of major surface combatants from 11 to 26. And it's not just about more vessels; it's about getting them faster.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the plan of those opposite when they were in power, we would have had one additional surface combatant vessel by 2024—just one! Under our plan, we'll have four, a quadrupling of the number. Importantly, they'll also be more lethal. The Leader of the Opposition's plan would have delivered 432 missile cells across the surface fleet. By contrast, our plan will deliver between 704 and 880 missile cells. Importantly, we'll sign the acquisition contract for the Hunter class this year, and we'll be cutting steel on the general-purpose frigate in 2026. By contrast, those opposite didn't sign a single new acquisition contract for a major service combatant in their entire sordid 9½ years in government—not a single one!
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, we will also be delivering continuous naval ship building for

          South Australia
         </a>
         . Once the Hunter class is finished, we will immediately follow on with a replacement for the air warfare destroyer. For the first time in the history of this nation, we're securing continuous naval ship building in

         . We're bringing forward the landing craft medium by two years, bringing forward the landing craft heavy by seven years, immediately following on with eight general-purpose frigates and then the large optionally crewed surface vessels. All in all, our plan will support 3,700 direct jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, thousands of well-paid and high skilled jobs contributing to the defence of the nation.

         My message to the electrician in Perth or the welder in Adelaide is that you've got decades of work under the Labor government. You can pay a mortgage, you can raise a family and you can contribute to the defence of the nation, secure in the knowledge the Albanese government has got your back. And all this is underpinned by real funding increases. Last week's plan was matched by an $11.1 billion funding increase to the defence budget which builds on the $30 billion of extra funding we provided in last year's budget. This brings the defence budget to 2.4 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         over the decade. By contrast, those opposite are still committed to a 2.1 per cent spend on the defence budget. Those opposite are committed to cutting the defence budget by $41 billion and cutting 3,700 jobs.
