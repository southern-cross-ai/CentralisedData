        Up in the gallery is my father, Oliver Wolahan, and his younger brother and my uncle, Ivor Wolahan, who's visiting from England. At a different time, they would have been joined by their elder brother, my uncle Canice Wolahan. Canice was a Vietnam veteranâ€”in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        Navy. He was married to Paula, and they had two children: Guy, who worked in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">

        as a bomb disposal technician, and his daughter, Alexandra, who works in the United Kingdom. Canice, sadly, died on 7 November 2021. He visited Australia on many occasions, and I'm sure he would have been up there with you. We miss him, and I know he was loved.

        Also someone who should be sitting up in the gallery is Angela Crawley. Angela Crawley was my aunt through marriage, Ivor's wife. Angela is fondly remembered by our family. My mum takes credit for Ivor meeting Angela. Angela's family came from

        in England. She came to babysit us on many occasions, and I think there she caught the eye of my uncle Ivor. Ivor now has settled in St Helens with his wonderful daughters, Lily and Alice. You always were the fun uncle, Ivor. Angela meant a great deal to all of us, as we know she did to you. She was loved, she will be missed, and we know she will live on through your beautiful daughters and your beautiful family.
