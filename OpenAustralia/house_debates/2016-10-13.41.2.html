        I rise today to table a petition which has been approved for presentation by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions from the residents of Fletcher, Maryland, Minmi and surrounds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The petition read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition from residents of Fletcher,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        , and surrounds, draws the attention of the House to the fact this community is without reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits by a pharmacist approved under Section 90 of the
        <i>
         National Heath Act 1953
        </i>
        . This community of more than 12,000 residents has been denied reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits due to an unintended consequence of the application of the Pharmacy Location Rules. The current level of one supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits to this community does not provide the population of more than 12,000 residents with reasonable, timely nor adequate access to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        (PBS). The current level of supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits does not allow residents to improve their health outcomes through access to, and quality use of, medicines in a timely manner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to give the community of Fletcher and surrounds reasonable access to the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits by requesting the Minister for Health exercise the Discretionary Power under subsection 90A(2) of the
        <i>
         National Health Act 1953
        </i>
        to approve the pharmacy premises at Shop 11, Fletcher Village, 221 Minmi Road, Fletcher, NSW, 2287.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 3,700 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        This geographical area is home to more than 12,000 residents, with a population growing at approximately four per cent each year. This growth is driven primarily by young families moving into the area, who have every right to expect timely, reliable and affordable access to necessary medicines for their families. That is the role of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Yet the only pharmacy in Fletcher, Your Chemist Shop Fletcher, currently operates as a non-PBS pharmacy, meaning these young families do not enjoy the timely, reliable or affordable access to PBS medicines that most Australians take for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the population of Fletcher continues to grow, so too will the health needs of this community. Local pharmacies play an essential role in the provision of good public and preventative health outcomes, and this role is indisputably enhanced by access to the very wide range of prescription medicines available under the PBS.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the 3,700 residents of Fletcher and surrounds, I table this petition in the House of Representatives today, asking the Minister for Health and Aged Care to exercise her discretionary power under the National Health Act and approve this shop as a PBS pharmacy.
