        It might interest the member for Lingiari to know that it's Gareth Evans's signature that sits on the bottom of that treaty, not John Howard's.

        The most impressive organisations are often those that do not seek the limelight, that quietly go under the radar and get the job done. The Northern Beaches Clean Up Crew is one such organisation. It began as a group of concerned locals cleaning up litter from beaches, and over the last three years it has expanded into an organised and dedicated part of the local community. This non-profit is able to run due to the selflessness of its volunteers, who give up their time on the last Sunday of every month. They pick up plastic, styrofoam and other detritus from our beaches, rubbish that would otherwise be left to pollute our natural environment. While they have not been able to conduct their clean-up since the pandemic hit, their resolve remains strong. They are committed to their aims.

        local who has been involved in the group since the very beginning. He attributes the increased success of the initiative to social media and the power of community, which has helped to steadily grow the number of volunteers. On behalf of our community, who, as you know, lives in the most beautiful part of Australia, and indeed I'd go as far as to say the best part of Australia—and I disagree with

        when he suggests he has the best beaches; everyone knows the northern beaches are the best—I thank Kobie for making that a reality. I thank the selfless locals of the northern beaches, who have bettered our community through their service.
