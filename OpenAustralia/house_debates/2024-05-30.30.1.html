        It is my absolute pleasure this afternoon to recognise one of the Illawarra's favourite teachers. Kris Mawson from Fairy Meadow Demonstration School was just in the building today with the Minister for Education,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Clare" rel="nofollow">
         Jason Clare
        </a>
        , and me, completing her very last excursion to this beautiful building after a stellar 43-year teaching career. Kris is an outstanding teacher whose tireless dedication and strong influence have had a profound effect on everyone at Fairy Meadow Demonstration School for more than 30 years. She goes above and beyond to ignite curiosity and inspire greatness in every student who has the pleasure to be taught by her. Kris is not only the assistant principal but also mentors many teachers, organises school sporting events and camps, and takes students to participate in the choral festival for choir and also

        </a>
        . Kris was also responsible for the demonstration program for student teachers at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UOW" rel="nofollow">

        , who attend the school and learn from their unique teaching methods. She has also lectured budding students at the university. Her colleague Jarret Napper has described Kris as one of those very special teachers who emerge only once in a lifetime. She has left an indelible mark on the lives of all who have had the privilege of working with and learning from her. Thank you, Kris, for all of your hard work, your passion and your tireless pursuit of excellence for students and teachers.
