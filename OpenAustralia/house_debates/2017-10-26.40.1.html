       <p>
        This Saturday is Small Business Day. I want to take the opportunity today to put on the record my admiration for the small business owners in my electorate. I'm proud of the fact that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        is home to 19,265 medium to small businesses. It's a remarkable statistic and one of the reasons I'm so proud to live in and represent O'Connor in this parliament. It takes courage, ambition and determination to start your own business, and the road isn't always easy. As a farmer and small businessman I have travelled this road and lived the highs and lows that risking your own capital and backing your judgement can bring.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to be part of a government where many of our members share my experience in small business and share a common goal of supporting our small businesses. To this end, the government is cutting the company tax rate for small to medium businesses because we believe in supporting the people who have the courage to pursue their dreams. The instant asset write-off for capital items up to $20,000 is always well-received in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's the work ethic and the drive of our small business owners that creates so many jobs for Australians. They create tens of thousands of jobs in my electorate and 5Â½ million jobs across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Saturday I'll be home for the 126th Katanning Agricultural Show, an event that wouldn't be possible without the support and sponsorship of our local businesses. We should all take a moment this Saturday to show our appreciation and celebrate the contribution of our small businesses to our great nation.
