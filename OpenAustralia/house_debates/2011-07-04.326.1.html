          The Attorney-General will resume his place. I think that on some occasions there are questions where there is a great deal of bipartisan support and I cannot believe that the House would leave those who are watching with the impression that we are trivialising those important issues. I have an expectation that the House will sit in silence on those occasions when there are those types of matters before us.

          <p>
           Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government's counterterrorism white paper identified home grown terrorism as the primary terrorist risk facing Australians and Australian interests and the figures in that respect are instructive. Since 2001 38 people have been charged with terrorism offences in Australia and, while some are yet to face the courts for decision, 37 of those 38 are Australian citizens and, in fact, 21 of the 38 were born in Australia. Just recently the Director-General of Security has made a speech outlining the extent to which individuals are attracted to violent extremist ideologies in many countries, including Australia. While their numbers are small, there is a disproportionate risk to Australians from that small number. So accordingly a comprehensive counterterrorism response necessarily means having a program to counter violent extremism.
          </p>
          <p>
           In that context, we have been working in partnership with a number of communities to identify extremist elements and to assist vulnerable people to resist the influence of those who would seek to encourage them down that path. The program that has been developed has been informed by expert analysis and advice as to the risk factors and also in terms of developing appropriate strategies. Essentially, that advice is that there is no single risk factor but by and large it does involve young men in particular becoming disconnected and disengaged from not only the mainstream community but also their own communities. That, in turn, makes them vulnerable to be exploited by those who would seek to encourage them down the path of violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first round of countering violent extremism measures was announced last year. They focused on youth mentoring, and today the government has announced an additional $1.7 million for 22 programs that focus on building community resilience. These programs are particularly interesting. They range from programs to communicate with youths who have been directly exposed to a violent extremist message through to local footy teams who are working with their local communities' youths from all back­grounds—to build partnerships and team building and an understanding of different views and, we hope, enduring friendships—through to teacher education and, indeed, development of a national curriculum as well as some grants to those who would develop websites and communication platforms to assist in countering the violent extremist message that can be communicated over the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Could I also congratulate those local governments that have been involved in a number of programs aimed at breaking down stereotyping and at empowering people to resist violent extremism. The government is working in partnership with communities and I can express our appreciation that they have been prepared to recognise the risks and they have been prepared to bring forward such innovative ideas to address the location and specific circumstances of those com­munities. While these are simple and small measures, they are practical measures and we hope they will make the world just that bit safer for our children and grandchildren in the years ahead.
