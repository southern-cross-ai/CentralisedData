        On indulgence, I have the sad responsibility to report to the House that another person with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1N1" rel="nofollow">
         H1N1
        </a>
        influenza has died. Since we have been in the chamber today, the Victorian government has made an announcement that a 35-year-old man from Colac in western Victoria, who was suffering from a number of other significant underlying medical conditions, was admitted to Maroondah Hospital on 19 June and died on 20 June. He is believed to have died from respiratory failure. However, because of his clinical history, samples were taken and the Victorian government was advised by the laboratory that he had tested positive to H1N1 influenza. Of course, the Australian government and, I am sure, the Australian parliament would like to pass on its condolences to the man’s family.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the second death in Australia of patients who have swine flu. It is a reminder that the flu can have severe outcomes for some people with existing conditions. I would like to take the opportunity to remind the public that those conditions include morbid obesity, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory diseases, asthma and pregnancy. However, I would also like to take the opportunity to remind people that, for the vast majority, this infection remains mild and most people will make a rapid and full recovery with no medical intervention.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will continue to focus our efforts, as will state and territory governments, on identifying and treating early those people who are most likely to suffer severe consequences. I urge the community to continue to follow sensible protocols if they are suffering from the flu, particularly if their family or colleagues have any of these conditions which put them particularly at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, as this disease continues to spread through the community, it is inevitable that we will experience more cases with severe outcomes, potentially also resulting in death. I thought it was important that the House be brought up to date with those recent developments.

        <p>
         On indulgence, on behalf of the coalition, I would like to extend to the family of the deceased man from Victoria our deepest sympathies. This is a serious situation, obviously, and, like the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         , I call on all Australians to heed the medical advice provided to them by their doctor or any other person they seek medical advice from at an emergency department and to listen to the public health warnings. The coalition has sought and received a number of briefings from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         and will continue to do so and to support the government where appropriate—to ask the appropriate questions but to be kept briefed on this developing situation at all times.
