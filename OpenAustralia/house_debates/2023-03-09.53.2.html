        We all had the opportunity recently to meet with members of our law enforcement, border force and

        â€”and, most importantly, some of the animals who help them perform their important role. I very much appreciated that opportunity, and it gives me the chance to highlight the

        for the Blind, who have recently rebranded slightly with a new name: See Differently. They operate in my electorate in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Plains" rel="nofollow">

        , training guide dogs to assist those with vision impairment. I really want to take the chance to give them a great shoutout for all the wonderful work that they do, and I look forward to supporting them in the way in which they're rebranding for the next era of the great things that they do to help those with vision impairment.
       </p>

        The guide dogs are obviously a significant part of what they do. They also run a manufacturing facility at the same site in Gilles Plains in my electorate, which offers an opportunity for people with vision impairment to work for them, earn an income and do things that are appropriate for their capabilities, given their vision challenges and the support that they need in the workforce. Probably most importantly, they also do excellent work to help workplaces be more suitable for people with vision impairment. I thank them for the work that they do and wish them the best of luck in the next chapter of their brand.
