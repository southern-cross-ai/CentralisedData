        The week before last I attended Nords Wharf Public School. When I visited that school, I presented them with two new flags—an Australian flag and an Aboriginal flag. They had just had two flagpoles erected and they needed the new flags to hang from them. The students of that school were particularly excited about the fact that they had these new flags and they told me all about the flags, their histories and what they stood for. In addition to presenting the flags to the school, I took along some of the Anzac medallions that I am giving to every student in the Shortland electorate. That was funded under the Centenary of Anzac grants that the government approved—each of us had $150,000 for our electorate. One of the proposals that was successful in Shortland was to present every schoolchild with an Anzac medallion. This was a proposal brought to the local committee by the Pelican

        Club. I thank Pelican RSL Club for sponsoring these medallions. I know that the students really love the medallions and that they will be keepsakes that they will have for the rest of their lives.
