        Today I would like to bring to the attention of House the awarding of the Order of Australia to

         Bill Disney

        . Bill Disney is a remarkable man. He received his

         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        list for services to the community of Dudley. Every single thing that has happened in Dudley Bill has been involved in. One of the organisations he is still involved in is the Dudley Combined Pensioners and Senior Citizens Association. He has run that group along with other residents of Dudley for many years. It has been one of the only pensioner groups to have a waiting list to join. This is a credit to Bill to a large extent. The Dudley Vintage Hall was renovated under his leadership. He has also been involved in the Dudley War Memorial and the Charlestown and District Meals on Wheels. Bill is an example of what it means to give your life to the community, to be absolutely committed to where he lives and the people who live there. Everything Bill does in his life is directed towards making the Dudley community a better place, ensuring that people have the services and resources they need. Congratulations Bill.
