        I come to this place this morning off the back of a Labor win in the great state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Let me tell you, I am absolutely delighted. I congratulate the members for Maitland, Cessnock,

        , Wallsend and Newcastle, in my patch, on their thumping victories—not to forget Charlestown, Swansea and the seats of the

        </a>
        . I also want to make mention of my good friend Peree Watson, who has worked tirelessly to represent Labor in the seat of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
         Upper Hunter
        </a>
        . The counting is continuing today, and we still hope that prepoll votes will close it in for her. Running for seats like the Upper Hunter is a true test of character and of holding the Labor torch. It looks easy on paper but, let me tell you, knowing the area as I do, it is a tough ask. Good on you, Peree, and thank you for flying the Labor flag so admirably.
       </p>

        What this means for my constituents in my seat of Paterson is a state government working with me and the federal government to find solutions to the ongoing issues dogging our communities: a better and final solution for the residents affected by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">

        in Williamtown; an alternative route out of Gillieston Heights when Testers Hollow goes under; doctors and nurses at the Maitland, Kurri and Tomaree hospitals; a container terminal for Newcastle; high schools for Huntley and Medowie; and, right across the electorate, roads, roads, and more roads. The people of New South Wales have placed their faith in Labor and Premier-elect Chris Minns, and I am really looking forward to working with my state colleagues to deliver.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do want to say again what a great victory it was for Chris Minns and the Labor team right across New South Wales, who have worked so hard. We know that we need better conditions and better pay for our healthcare and aged-care workers, and also for our teachers. They did such a remarkable job during the pandemic. We know that, over the last few years—like no other time in our modern history—communities in Australia have had to rally together. We know that there is a squeeze on in emergency departments, to get workers in small business and for our teachers and our nurses. I am just so delighted that we're going to have a government in New South Wales that takes its profession seriously, takes everyone's jobs seriously and gets on with a fresh start for New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, Chris Minns! Let's bring it home for the seat of Paterson.
