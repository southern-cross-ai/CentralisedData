        I rise to table a petition about an issue that has been raised by constituents of mine, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Baptist Church
        </a>
        in Kotara and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Luke" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        in Belmont, about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Poverty_History" rel="nofollow">
         Make Poverty History
        </a>
        campaign. The petition highlights issues of great importance in that campaign. Members of those churches are asking for the parliament to pledge support to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, which are two of the eight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        . They highlight the point that, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" rel="nofollow">
         South Asia
        </a>
        and the Pacific, 16 of the 22 developing countries are not on track to achieve millennium goal 4, a reduction in mortality of two-thirds, and seven countries are not on track to achieve millennium goal 5, to reduce the mortality rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The women from the churches are very committed to the campaign. They also asked me to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_McMullan" rel="nofollow">
         Bob McMullan
        </a>
        , the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, for his commitment to invest an additional $300,000 for water and sanitisation by 2010, and the Prime Minister for his commitment to lift aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income. They would still like to see that aid lifted to 0.7 per cent by 2015, and they highlighted the fact that, in our region, there are a number of countries that are really struggling to meet the millennium goals. In countries as close as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        one in 600 women die in childbirth, so a lot of work needs to be done. They highlighted that, since the adoption of the millennium goals in 2000, there has been much progress, with children attending school, immunisation and children surviving past their fifth birthday. However, they would like Australia to do a bit more and contribute a bit more to help those countries that are really struggling to meet their targets. They believe that it would be very useful if we would increase our contribution to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
         UNICEF
        </a>
        and other organisations such as theirs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table the concerns of my constituents and put on record that they are a fine group of women from fine churches that really care not only about their community but also about other struggling communities throughout the world. I am pleased to present the petition.
