        I rise to speak again about some more incredible young achievers in the electorate of Ryan. Each year, I run a young leadership award where local schools put forward students who have gone above and beyond and excelled themselves. This year, more than ever, we have needed their leadership, and these students who were nominated for the award have shown leadership amongst their peers at a very, very difficult time. It has been an absolute pleasure to recognise them all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll start with Dylan Bryant, in year 9 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gap_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         The Gap State High School
        </a>
        . Dylan has demonstrated exemplary leadership, both formally and informally, at his school. He served as junior arts prefect and was able to be a reliable and energetic team player, always attending every meeting with a strong sense of purpose and intent. He played a key role in mentoring year 8 leaders, hosting junior school assemblies and writing in the year 9 family newsletter during lockdown. He's also got a very special talent. He's showing impressive initiative by advocating for a new school song, and, in advocating for it, he is writing the lyrics and music himself. We all look forward to seeing that project come to fruition, Dylan.

        There's Emma MacDonald, a year 4 student at Brookfield State School. It was my great pleasure to meet Emma. She is a very special young lady. She is going to go on to do very big things, I know. Each year in term 4, Emma organises and coordinates a contribution to the

        food drive, and last year, with the help of Brookfield State School and the Brookfield community, she managed to collect over 1,000 food items to give to those in need over Christmas. This year, due to COVID, Emma felt that there were many people who were finding it hard to provide for their families, and she promoted this cause at the junior and senior assemblies and provided a decorated box and sign at the office for donations and collected donations throughout the school community. Well done, Emma.

        Rachel Telfer and Mahjabeen Ashraf are year 6 students at Ironside State School. Unfortunately, I could not attend the year 6 graduation ceremony at Ironside State School as I was down here representing you in Canberra, but I'm so pleased to be able to recognise you with this Young Community Leader Award. Their teachers have told me that they are well respected amongst their peers and they go above and beyond to serve their school community, but, most importantly, to look out for their fellow students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, there's Eloise McGregor, of year 6 at Chapel Hill State Primary School. Eloise has an excellent attitude towards her learning, is a diligent worker at all times and has achieved some outstanding results in all of her subject areas. She is the

        captain this year and has displayed leadership skills in this role, particularly when editing the assembly. She has been part of the school's IGNITE program since year 3 and has participated in the

        over the past two years, using her own time to prepare, and was awarded a high distinction this year. So well done, Eloise.
       </p>

        Well done to all those students. We have so many clever and skilled students in the Ryan electorate. It's a pleasure to recognise them this year again.
