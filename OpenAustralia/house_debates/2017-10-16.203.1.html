        Where is the fair go for the west? I proudly represent my home town and I am prepared to fight every day for what's fair. My community are being taken for a ride by the Berejiklian and Turnbull Liberals.

        when it's election time, but their rhetoric come normal time doesn't match that at all. Next Saturday, 21 October, our community will see a rally like never before—a group of people who care so much about the area they'll be standing up and fighting back. They will rally against the new not-so-new M4 toll—a toll we already paid for and saw off is now back for another 43 years on a road that is little more than a moving car park during our peak hours. They will rally against the world's largest incinerator, dumped on the doorstep of a local school and 800 metres from homes' doorsteps, operated by a shonky businessman who's already had his fair share of environmental infringement notices. They will rally against a 24-hour airport that has no infrastructure plan or jobs plan for locals, but we keep getting told that it is the only thing we're worthy of having, that it is good for us and that we should just accept it. Well, if this government was prepared to be more transparent about it, maybe we would. They will rally against the WestConnex; as the name describes it, it's a con and will see investment in public transport for our region starved for an entire generation. I'll be rallying for

        , which has seen no increase in clinical funding. They promised us $550 million, but we need $1 billion. I say to the Liberals making plans for Western Sydney: unless you're prepared to come in and give us what we need and what is fair, you can take your incinerator, your airport, the most under pressure hospital in the state and your toll into your own communities and see how long you last.
