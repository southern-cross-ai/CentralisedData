        I also acknowledge the eminent former speakers in the gallery today and welcome them to the Australian parliament. We often, and rightly so, as a community pause to remember brave Australian men and women who have sacrificed it all for this country. Earlier this month on the 11th at 11 am, we came together to remember those who served from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        through to modern conflicts. At a small ceremony later that day, in Canungra in my electorate, other servants of the Australian military were receiving tributes for their centuries of service. Today I rise to pay tribute to these often overlooked servants of the Australian military.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout history in war and peacetime, animals and mankind have worked alongside each other. Animals have served our nation in times of war as beasts of burden, messengers, protectors, mascots and friends. I'm wearing this red-and-purple poppy pin gifted to me by the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation. The purple poppy symbolises all animals who have died during the conflicts. It's a great honour, on behalf of the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation in federal parliament, to dedicate 24 February 2019 as the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day" rel="nofollow">

        for War Animals in Australia. On 24 February every year, Australians will be able to pause and pay tribute to those animals that have served in our country's wartime and in peacetime.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank and acknowledge both Nigel Allsopp, a local constituent of mine, and the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation he runs for their tireless dedication and pursuit of this recognition for war animals. I met with Nigel earlier this year again to gain a greater understanding of the work that he undertakes under the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation banner. Over eight years ago, the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation began donating care packages to operational military working dogs in

        , countries around the world honour Australian war animals with a national day of their own. Now Australia can join in honouring them. As the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These war animals have demonstrated true valour and an enduring partnership with humans. The bond is unbreakable, their sacrifice great â€¦
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on all Australians to join with me in honouring Australian animals in war on 24 February.
