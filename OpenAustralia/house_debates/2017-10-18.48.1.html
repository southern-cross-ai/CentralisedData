        I hear from so many residents in my electorate about their desire to see better, safer roads in our community, and this was evident last Saturday when, despite the pouring rain and the wind, dozens of local residents joined me at Wamberal surf club for a community barbecue to discuss newly announced safety upgrades at Willoughby Road. Last year, the coast was devastated after 17-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Jackson Williams
        </a>
        was killed on Willoughby Road at the notorious dip. Following a community led petition of more than 5,000 signatures, which I presented in this place, we secured more than $500,000 from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government for safety upgrades. I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport; to Adam Crouch, the member for Terrigal; to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Williams" rel="nofollow">

        , and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; and to Lindy Hewitt, a local resident, for their work on the issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this is an important first step, at our community barbecue I also heard from other locals who have additional concerns. Kate told me that pedestrian access on Willoughby Road was a huge issue, particularly for mums with prams, and she said that the road desperately needs a footpath. Leanne, an avid cyclist, told me it can be just as bad for those on bikes. Others raised the possibility of the installation of speed cameras and guardrails. The thing I was struck by was the passion our community have for this issue and their determination to make our roads safer.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the community meeting,

        representatives have agreed to meet with Wamberal residents at a roundtable next month. I'd love to hear from anyone who would like to join us at that roundtable. Thank you to each and every resident of Wamberal who joined us on the weekend. I look forward to continuing this important discussion.
