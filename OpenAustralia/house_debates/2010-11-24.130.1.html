        The Save Bahrs Scrub Alliance, with the support of a Logan City EnviroGrant, has recently produced a flora book which describes some of the precious and rare plants found in the Bahrs Scrub precinct, presently threatened by development. Previous approvals by the Gold Coast
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for residential development in Bannockburn, Bahrs Scrub and Clarkes Hill have removed fauna corridors and koala habitat. This is the reason a group called the Save Bahrs Scrub Alliance has been formed—to save this unique piece of rainforest and a significant landmark within the Forde electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bahrs Scrub is a significant area of bushland in the electorate, situated near Windaroo. Parts of Bahrs Scrub are classified as lowland, subtropical rainforest, which are unfortunately the last remnants of what was once much more extensive. Bahrs Scrub has been called unique by botanists, as there are at least 456 native plant species in the area, which is classed as extraordinarily high for such a small area. Adding to its uniqueness is the fact that at least 12 species of plants at Bahrs Scrub are classified as rare or threatened.
       </p>

        Recently,

         Logan City Council
        </a>
        released the Bahrs Scrub Local Development Area Plan. This land is identified in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Queensland_Regional_Plan" rel="nofollow">
         South East Queensland Regional Plan
        </a>
        2009-2031 as an area that can accommodate urban residential development in the short term, and provide recreation and open space opportunities for residents. Logan City Council has a vision for the Bahrs Scrub local development area to develop as an urban residential community catering for a population of some 11,000 residents during the next 15 to 20 years.

       <p>
        Bahrs Scrub has been classified previously as worth protecting, with the

         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        ’s NatureMapping review of 2005 identifying the forests of Bahrs Scrub as being of state significance for conservation. In May 2009, the Border Ranges Rainforest Diversity Management Plan, for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        and Queensland, also identified the rainforests of Bahrs Scrub as a hot spot of significant biodiversity and a priority for management. Previously, in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPI" rel="nofollow">
         DPI
        </a>
        vegetation mapping series of the late 1970s, Bahrs Scrub rainforests were identified as areas to be permanently protected as a scientific resource.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate of Forde is very fortunate to have an area such as Bahrs Scrub, as well as community groups that are looking to protect it. It would be a shame to lose such a valuable and unique piece of land. My office will continue to work with relevant stakeholders in the hope of achieving the broader aim of protecting this valuable area for future generations.
