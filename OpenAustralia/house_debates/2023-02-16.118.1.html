       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge and congratulate members of the community of Bennelong who recently received
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        awards. The Australia Day honours recognise the incredible work of Aussies who have made a positive impact on our society. They are a celebration of our shared values and of the remarkable people who embody them, and I can say with confidence that each of Bennelong's honorees is a true embodiment of those values. It's an immense honour to recognise here in the parliament some of the exceptional members of our community who were recipients of these awards and recognitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Ryde, the City of Ryde Citizen of the Year was Ross Forster, a volunteer coach who for the last 40 years has dedicated his time to the athletics community in Ryde. He played a crucial role in setting up Ryde Athletics' fundraising activities to provide travel grants for their athletes who represent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        or Australia. The Ryde Young Citizen of the Year is Maria Gharemanian, who supports our vibrant and large local Armenian community. She volunteers her time and skills at a community club. She volunteers at various organisations throughout the community and encourages young people to volunteer as well, particularly to support migrant families settling in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two members of the Bennelong community received the privilege of becoming members of the Order of Australia. Jennifer Collins of Ryde has received an AM for her significant service to veterans and their families and to nursing. She has served as the chair and director of the

        </a>
        , as well as deputy chair of the New South Wales branch of the War Widows Guild of Australia. In Eastwood, Emeritus Professor Richard Lionel Howitt, someone I have met a number of times, received an AM for his ongoing and significant service to education and to the Indigenous community. Professor Howitt has served at

He was instrumental in looking at opportunities to connect the university with the local community through his role as director of the Macquarie-Ryde FUTURES project. Emeritus Professor John Thomson of Marsfield received an AM for his service to botanical science and research and to tertiary education. He served at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as an honorary research associate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eight members of our community were awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . This is a nice story: in Denistone, Warren and Clare Hopley, a husband and wife, received joint
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        s for their service to education, particularly to the disadvantaged and to children who are hard of hearing. Warren and Clare have both served outstanding long-term careers as teachers in schools across Sydney. Clare has had an outstanding career working with children who are deaf or hearing impaired and developed a program that improved the social and educational outcomes of children with hearing loss. Her husband, Warren, has always chosen to work at schools where he can advocate for the marginalised in our community. He has had a long and extraordinary commitment to welcoming, settling and integrating refugee children, as well.

        In Marsfield we have Janet Craik, who received an OAM for her service to her community. She served as coordinator of music at the Australian Christian Music Seminar in Cooma from 1978 to 2002, as well as being coordinator of the
