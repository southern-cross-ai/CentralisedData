        I rise to congratulate those selfless individuals from the Riverina and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">
         Central West
        </a>
        , past and present, who have been recognised for their outstanding community service in this year's King's Birthday honours list. It seems strange to say 'King's Birthday'—and, of course you have to be a lot older than 72, probably, to have actually talked about the King's Birthday—but we all enjoyed the long weekend, and whilst it's always been, in all of our lifetimes, called the

         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        , this year it was the King's Birthday. And long may he sit on the throne.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank those selfless individuals who enrich not just my wonderful region but each and every one of our electorates. They do so much and expect so little—in fact, nothing—in return. They don't do it for recognition. They don't do it for acknowledgment. They do it because they love community. They do it because they want their areas, cities and towns to be their best. Locally, the King's Birthday honours included

        and the community. She was at the front desk at Henschke Primary School for more years than she'd probably care to remember, the wife of Barry and a wonderful, wonderful human being. Aunty Cheryl Penrith OAM was recognised for services to the Indigenous community, and I thank Aunty Cheryl for what she's doing for our local Aboriginal Wiradjuri community. Ray Willett OAM was recognised for service to the Wagga Wagga community through emergency service organisations, and Dr Saba Nabi OAM was rewarded for her service to community health, education and multicultural affairs.

        , OAM, for her service to emergency response organisations. The late Kenneth Karsten OAM was acknowledged for his service to Weethalle, not a large community but a vibrant one indeed.

        , AO, for his distinguished service to business, to rugby union as an administrator, and to the community through philanthropic contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        From Parkes we had Dr Stephen Morris, who was awarded an OAM for his service to medicine. Olya Willis, from Forbes, earned an OAM for her community history efforts, and I thank her for preserving and protecting all that is great about Forbes' past. Clifford Sheridan OAM, from Young, was recognised for service to his community—of course, it's known as the cherry-picking capital of Australia, as it should be. Clifford has done so much for that south-west slopes community. The Reverend Barry James Dwyer, from Parkes—again—received an OAM for his service to the Catholic Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes, a massive diocese. He's done so much to help the people—not just Catholics but all people—within that region.

        Former Yass Mayor Rowena Abbey is not from the Riverina. The member for Eden-Monaro would know the value that Rowena has brought to that community, and she's a great person.

        of Murrumbidgee Council—again, it's not in my electorate, but in the electorate of Farrer—Councillor Ruth McRae OAM from Jerilderie was recognised. What a wonderful person. She's been a deputy mayor, she's been a mayor and she does so much that's not seen. And, of course, I know the value of somebody, and the integrity of somebody, is not about when they're being seen to be doing something, but it is about what they're doing when they're not being seen, when they're behind the scenes, helping in, pitching in and contributing. Another such person is Griffith City Council General Manager Brett Stonestreet, who was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        . Again, he's not from my electorate, but I know him well. I used to serve the city of Griffith—a wonderful city of 27,500, or even more. Much of Griffith's progress in recent years has been because of his delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend all of those people—in local government, health, philanthropic services, history, the military and other areas—for what they've done for our community, which is second to none. I know each and every one of us would share those sentiments for the selfless individuals within our communities, who do so much to make our communities the vibrant places they are in which to live, work, play, and raise a family.
