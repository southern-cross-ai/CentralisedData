        The Ryan electorate is fortunate to have many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches and is also home to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at Enoggera. As happens every year, the 2011 Anzac Day ceremonies and marches saw a huge turnout of our local residents to honour the services of the men and women of our defence forces. Mr Merv Brown and the Gaythorne RSL sub-branch continued a special competition which they initiated in our electorate last year. It is designed to encourage school children to learn about and commemorate our servicemen and servicewomen and to increase their understanding and appreciation of the work undertaken by our defence forces.

        Last year, they held the inaugural Anzac Day writing competition for local schools, through which students could express in their own words ' what Anzac Day means to me ' . After the success of last year ' s competition, this year the RSL posed the question: what roles have women played in wars and peacekeeping missions in which Australia has been involved? The calibre of entrants was outstanding, and I was honoured to be invited to attend the presentation ceremony to award some of these talented young writers. The aim of the competition, to help educate our young students on the importance of servicemen and servicewomen, was clearly achieved. I thank the president of the Gaythorne RSL sub-branch, Mr Merv Brown, the branch secretary, Cathy Toms, and all involved for their valuable contribution to the Anzac legacy.
