       <p>
        The release of Labor’s Climate Change Blueprint was hardly an earth-shattering event, but it did resonate in Gladstone, which stands to lose thousands of jobs if the opposition follows through with its commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Labor has pledged to sign the Kyoto protocol, impose 60 per cent greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2050 and impose carbon trading on Australian industry, all of which adds up to a disaster for the working families of Gladstone and the wider
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor’s policy might give some ‘warm and fuzzies’, but it will strip investment from industrial hubs like Gladstone and jobs from local working families. Let us not have more of the Beazley cant that he went on with at an earlier election campaign in Gladstone, where he said he would get special arrangements for Gladstone. We all know that is pap. By trying to court the green vote by ratifying Kyoto, Labor is willing to sacrifice Australian jobs, exports and quality of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gladstone’s secret weapon is its ability to provide cheap, coal-fired power, with around $6 billion worth of projects currently on the drawing board. Would we be happy to see these go offshore? These projects include, for example, Queensland Coke and Energy’s joint venture with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanwell_Corporation" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the Gladstone Pacific Nickel project, the Wiggins Island coal terminal development and the expansion of the Fishermans Landing port facilities, which my colleague opposite has actually seen on the drawing boards up there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me make three other points. First, Australia sets targets and meets them, regardless of Kyoto. Second, many of Australia’s competitors, so-called developing countries, would not be constrained by Kyoto. Third, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         Asia Pacific
        </a>
        partnership, Australia is helping to achieve some realistic goals and meeting them. Pleasingly,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        referred to this in his speech in the House this week—an acknowledgment that it is not what a lot of critics in Australia said it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent study showed that 15
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        Kyoto signatory countries—including Ireland, Italy and Spain—will miss their Kyoto targets. It showed that carbon dioxide emissions will increase in 13 of those nations over the coming years. Seriously, is this the shining path Labor wants to lead Australia down—a path strewn with hypocrisy, unachievable goals and economic stagnation for our country?
