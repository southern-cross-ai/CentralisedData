        One of the great things about representing the people of Ipswich and the Somerset region is the opportunity to join with them to celebrate community milestones and achievements. My day on Saturday started at Esk at 7.30 am, when I spoke on politics and faith at the Esk Men's Breakfast. There were representatives of many churches in the local area. Food and conversation were in good supply and I want to thank Pastor Sid Firrell for his invitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        After breakfast, it was down the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Valley_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Valley Highway
        </a>
        to the town of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorgan_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Glamorgan Vale
        </a>
        , where I joined many people to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the Glamorgan Vale State School. That included a street parade, historical displays, a luncheon and fireworks. I want to thank the principal, Troy Coombs, who has been there for about six or seven years now, as well as teachers, parents and students past and present. It was a wonderful day. I particularly want to congratulate President Shane Beattie of the P&amp;C subcommittee, who worked tirelessly for over a year to make Saturday the success it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Glamorgan Vale it was over to Rosewood, where I emceed the seventh annual festival and street parade. I did that, along with the member for Ipswich West, Jim Madden, and Ipswich mayor, Paul Pisasale. In Ipswich, it is widely known that it is dangerous to stand between Paul Pisasale and an open microphone, but on Saturday I think I held my own!
       </p>
       <p>
        The parade was magnificent, bigger and better than ever, with over 200 floats, walkers, classic cars and utes. I thank the Rosewood Festival Committee; parade organiser, Diane Barry; and Councillor David Pahlke for organising yet another wonderful Rosewood Festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, from Rosewood it was over to Springfield, on the eastern edge of the Blair electorate, for the official opening of the Orion Lagoon at Robelle Domain. The Orion Lagoon is Ipswich's new 'Southbank'; it is better than the one in Brisbane. As an Ipswichian, I can say it is clearly bigger and better. And, if you do not believe me, ask
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">
         Laurie Lawrence
        </a>
        , who also believes that and pronounced that on Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the year's end the lagoon will feature a kiosk, barbeque facilities and of course a lagoon, with about 40 lifeguards employed at that particular location. Stage 1 of Robelle Domain Parklands brings in 200,000 people a year into Ipswich. It is estimated that Stage 2 will bring 120,000 people to Ipswich. With a population of just under 200,000 it shows the contribution it will make not only to the economy but also to the friendship, fellowships and community life in the Ipswich region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the former federal Labor government for contributing $15 million to the Regional Development Australia Fund. It would not have happened without the great participation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        . I congratulate Mayor Paul Pisasale and the council on that. The only shame of the whole thing is the years of the Campbell Newman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government and the fact that it did not contribute the necessary $5 million to make it even better.
