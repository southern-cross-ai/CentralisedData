        I believe it is important to connect Canberra and my community directly by giving my constituents the opportunity to speak with ministers often, and face to face, about the issues that matter to them. I commend this government for the fact that ministers have already made the journey up to the

        42 times since my election in 2016, and I note the member for Swan will be coming up very, very shortly as well.

        In the next two weeks, I'll be hosting two more forums in Fisher to talk about some of the most important issues for my constituents. On Friday 6 March, at 2 pm, I will host the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management at the Beerwah community hall, where he'll be answering locals' questions about the government's response to this summer's devastating bushfires, as well as the ongoing impacts of drought in Queensland. On Tuesday 10 March, the Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology, Senator Hume, will join us at Venue 114 in Bokarina, from 4 pm, to talk about the future of retirement incomes in Australia over the next 30 years, and what support current and future retirees can already access. I'm very grateful to both ministers and, in fact, to all ministers for taking the time to come up to the Sunshine Coast. I would encourage all of my constituents to take every opportunity to come and listen to what they have to say.
