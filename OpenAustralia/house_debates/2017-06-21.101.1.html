        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the importance to the Australian economy of a stable and secure energy network? What are the impacts of higher electricity prices and a less stable supply on job security and the hip pockets of hardworking Australian families like those in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein?

         I thank the member for Goldstein, and I appreciate his interest in this very serious topic of energy affordability and security for Australians. The Turnbull government is on the side of Australians who want to have affordable, reliable and sustainable access to energy in this country. That is why in the budget we outlined a five-point plan to put downward pressure on electricity prices in this country: to secure our gas supplies; to get a fair deal for energy customers; to change the rules that are driving prices up by reforming regulations; to invest in maintaining baseload energy security regardless of where that source of energy comes from; and to invest in low-emissions technologies. This is a real plan to deliver the affordable, reliable, secure and sustainable energy that a modern economy depends on to grow and drive the incomes that Australians and Australian businesses depend on. It is technology neutral, it is resource neutral and it is ideology neutral—which is incredibly important.

         Labor's response is to cheer on the closure of coal-fired power stations that provide dispatchable, reliable power to Australian businesses and Australian households. Labor's response is to cheer that on. What is the Labor Party's message to electors and people in Portland, Wollongong, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         and the

         </a>
         when they are cheering on the demise of the traditional energy producing industries of this country? They are happy to sell out one million manufacturing and mining workers in this country—one in 10 workers—for an almond milk latte with the Greens when it comes to energy policy in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         And they are embarrassed about their policies which are driving up prices. We all remember the shadow Treasurer's train wreck interviews when he was forced to admit that the Labor Party has a 50 per cent renewable energy target which will only drive up prices for businesses and householders alike. When Patricia Karvelas asked about this target, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Well, Patricia, what we're saying is that it will … you … you.. you can't just … you… you can legislate a target, right, but that doesn't achieve the target. What achieves the target is the policy we've indicated. There is a Renewable Energy Target which is, in effect—
        </p>
        <p>
         Patricia thankfully interrupts him and says, 'So why wouldn't you also'—and then the transcriber says, 'The shadow Treasurer exhales heavily.' I am not surprised that he would exhale heavily, because he cannot bring himself to admit to the policy that the shadow Treasurer now supports, which is—
