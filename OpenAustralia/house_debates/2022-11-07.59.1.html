        I had the pleasure of touring Lloyd Street Primary School in Malvern recently. The school will be celebrating its centenary next year and is a mix of traditional red brick buildings and newer structures around a playground with pear blossoms in full bloom. I had the privilege of meeting some of their students: Charlie, Ellie, Raff, Ivy and Annabel, who, under the supervision of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Painter" rel="nofollow">

        , took me on a tour. The children were articulate, thoughtful and personable. Principal John was happily sidelined as they took over. We came across clusters of children on the oval all deep in thought learning about life insurance, health insurance and income protection, which is part of their financial literacy program. I wish I had been offered this in my early years. It would've saved me a lot of heartache and a lot of dollars later in life!
