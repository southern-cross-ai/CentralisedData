        TradeMutt is a clothing company, and this is part of their story, from Dan:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Towards the end of 2016, everything for me came to a grinding halt. I was floored by the news that one of my best mates had unexpectedly taken his own life. His name was also Dan, and … this was the first time in my life that I had been affected by suicide. As hard as I remember it being to accept, it must have been unmeasurable compared to what was felt by his mum, dad and brother …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        TradeMutt came about … following what happened in 2016. We are an Australian Workwear brand that aims to make tradies and workers of all kinds look and feel great at work, and in doing so, reduce the rate of male suicide in Australia. Our loud and vibrant shirts—

        such as that being held up by the member for Curtin—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        act as a catalyst to starting the conversation around mental health and men, a topic that has been hard to approach in the past for blokes, mostly due to the attached stigmas and perceived weaknesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The message from Ed and Dan is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        [We] can't thank you enough for getting on board this movement with us. We hope that wearing these shirts brings you the same happiness and courage that we have experienced … We both hope that this can encourage the cultural shift in Aussie blokes that is necessary to effectively lower the rate of suicide in Australia. The right pocket features the letters
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YNWA" rel="nofollow">
         YNWA
        </a>
        , which is … a reminder for anyone wearing one of these shirts,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You'll_Never_Walk_Alone" rel="nofollow">
         You'll Never Walk Alone
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        These shirts are a conversation starter, and they prompt you to ring for help, if you need it, on 0488486988. Well done to the TradeMutt team.
