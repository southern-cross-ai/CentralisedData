        Today marks the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. In four days time we will mark the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. Those in the House of Representatives may not know that in 1942, after this event,
        <i>
         Hansard

        was closed and both houses prayed for wisdom. Such was the gravity of the situation.

        , the first member for Mallee—I am the fourth member for Mallee—was captured at the fall of Singapore and became a prisoner of war in Changi for 3½ years. He was elected to parliament after coming back from the war and served in the House of Representatives for 26 years as a member of parliament. He was a man of character. But what is interesting is that, as a prisoner of war and then a member of parliament, he was part of the government that formulated trading relationships with Japan. He moved beyond a position of conflict to a position of forgiveness. That trading relationship has cemented 70 years of peaceful relations with Japan.

        Trade and interaction with countries creates peace. It worries me that around the world some people are promoting agendas that are pushing others away rather than interacting with others. We need to have the character of Sir Winton Turnbull and look at forgiveness and interaction and, ultimately, we will have a more peaceful world as a result.
