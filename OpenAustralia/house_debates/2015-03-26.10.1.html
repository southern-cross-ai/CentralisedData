       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost a year ago today, I provided a statement in this House on the critical issues facing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Norfolk Island
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I introduce a bill that seeks to resolve these issues through a range of significant changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norfolk Island is a small and remote community with a population of around 1,800 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like any remote community, Norfolk Island has challenges in terms of service delivery, infrastructure maintenance and economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, on Norfolk Island these challenges have only been magnified by a unique set of governance arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under arrangements established in 1979, the Norfolk Island government is required to deliver all local, state and many federal servicesâ€”more than any other government in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not reasonable to expect such a small and remote community to deliver these responsibilities effectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no surprise that services on Norfolk Island are now well below the standard Australians typically expect.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, there is almost a complete absence of the health and social services most Australians take for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        For instance, Norfolk Island is the only place in Australia where Australian citizens do not receive social security benefits and do not fully participate in the Australian taxation system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norfolk Island's problems are not new, but they are now critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been no significant infrastructure investment since the 1970s, and the Norfolk Island government has not had the capacity to maintain what was built then, or earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Island's Hospital is outdated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The roads are deteriorating.
       </p>
       <p>
        And the island's electricity network is at risk of collapse.
       </p>
       <p>
        The financial position of the Norfolk Island government is also dire.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has provided in excess of $40 million in assistance since 2010 to keep essential services operating.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this assistance has not dealt with the underlying problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bills introduced today provide the structural reform needed to strengthen Norfolk Island and ensure its sustainability.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2016, the Norfolk Island community will have access to social security payments.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island residents will pay income tax and other direct federal taxes on all of their income, not just their income sourced from the mainland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal taxes will replace a range of inefficient taxes and charges currently levied by the Norfolk Island government.
       </p>
       <p>
        This includes a local goods and services tax and punitive customs charges. Both of these will be removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government will also extend the superannuation guarantee to Norfolk Island, to allow future generations to save for their retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        To minimise the impact on business, the guarantee will be phased in over the next twelve years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic modelling has shown that the long term impact of these changes will be overwhelmingly positive.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the Centre of International Economics, gross territory product is projected to increase by around 25 per cent, and household consumption will go up by 52 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the full application of Australia's social security and taxation system alone does not address the longstanding need for governance reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        The need for governance reform is well recognised and has been the subject of numerous reports, inquiries and submissions over the last four decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most recently, the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories concluded that governance and economic reform must occur together to give the community the greatest chance of recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's strong and bipartisan recommendation was that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly be transitioned to a regional council.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill I am introducing today will achieve this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the bill's commencement, the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Council
        </a>
        will be dissolved, and a local advisory council appointed to represent community views.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2016, a Norfolk Island Regional Council will be established to deliver an extended range of local services.
       </p>
       <p>
        This council will be elected by islanders to represent islanders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this model local issues will be driven at the local level wherever possible, without placing unreasonable expectations on this small and remote community.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2016,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        laws will gradually be applied on Norfolk Island to provide a modern body of state law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government will also negotiate with the New South Wales government to expand the range of services it currently provides.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other federal services will also be extended.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2016, the Australian migration system will replace the immigration arrangements currently maintained by the Norfolk Island government.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will remove a key barrier to tourism and trade, and simplify travel arrangements significantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Customs and biosecurity services will also be provided by Australian government agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes will bring Norfolk Island in line with other Australian communities and ensure services are delivered to a modern standard by the appropriate level of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although common sense, these reforms represent significant change for the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, our goal is to put Norfolk Island on a more sustainable footing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is about delivering growth and prosperity and protecting Norfolk Island's cultural identity and rich heritage for generations to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the community for its active engagement to date and for showing such strong support for the reforms being implemented today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government will continue to engage closely with the community during this process and into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to doing what is needed to deliver a better future for all Australians, regardless of where they live.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
