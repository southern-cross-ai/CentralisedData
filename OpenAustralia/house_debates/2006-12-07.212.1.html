        , the government’s Investing in Our Schools funding program will provide improved facilities for students in my electorate.

       <p>
        I had the pleasure of informing and congratulating 11 schools in the Petrie electorate that their applications to furnish, upgrade, improve or provide for their students have been approved. Redcliffe

        will receive $85,010 to purchase a bus for their school transport needs. Bracken Ridge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_School" rel="nofollow">
         State School
        </a>
        will receive $119,739, which means they can start progress on three projects which involve erecting shade structures for the students. Bracken Ridge State High will continue to purchase classroom furniture with their grant and Hercules Road State High will fit out their new community venue with curtains and a data projector. They will allow students to put on wonderful and professional performances for parents and the wider community. I want to put on record my appreciation to Principal Geoffrey Rose. I know that he is looking forward to opening up his school for wider artistic concerts and benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Down at Aspley, the Aspley State School received $138,130 for the construction of a canteen. I know that they will provide very good, healthy food for their students. North Lakes State School received three grants totalling $118,941 for the purchase of computer and playground equipment. College Director Mark Campling has informed me that this will go towards the purchase of a cricket pitch. So we may see some new additions to the Australian cricket team in the future as a result of this great school funding.

        will put $150,000 towards their music and drama facilities for the benefit of their students. Humpybong State School received $49,130 for the purchase of computer equipment. I would like to place on record that Humpybong is the oldest state school on the

        . Norris Road State School received two government grants totalling $116,960 for construction and purchase of computer equipment, and Stafford Heights State School received $38,519 to help improve the school grounds for the students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly of all, a school that does a very good job, Woody Point Special School—and I want to place on record my tribute to the parents and teachers—received $149,052 to construct kitchen facilities for the students. Principal Bruce Hartshorn was very appreciative, as are many of his students who require very special dietary foods. Those new kitchen facilities will provide that. Now two classrooms will share one kitchenette instead of a whole school accessing one communal kitchen.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these grants will improve the quality of the education facilities in my electorate. I am very grateful to this government for providing this wonderful support to staff and students through regular upgrades. The Investing in Our Schools program recognises the importance of providing schools with facilities that will enhance the education and wellbeing of students. The program will provide some $700 million over the life of the initiative to fund state school capital projects that have been identified and prioritised by local school communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to place on record my sincere appreciation and thanks for all of the P&amp;C committees of the schools I have mentioned. They work tirelessly and are incredible people. They put in so much time and effort, and many parents continue in P&amp;C positions well after their children have left school. So I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of the principals, teachers, P&amp;C committee members, students and families from the electorate a happy and safe holiday.
