        It always gives me great pleasure to rise in this place and share some positive news about the good people of the electorate of Forde. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of local business owners who are passionate about giving back to our local community. Garry and Sharon Sibthorpe, who are the owners of the Battery World store in Beenleigh, were recently recognised for their dedication to our community when they beat 82 stores to win the community engagement award at the company's annual national conference in March this year. Some of the things they have been able to donate back to the community include batteries for the Volunteer Marine Rescue Service, money to support chaplains in our local schools and sponsorship of the Wednesday Beenleigh bowls club competition.

        I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of one of our local day care centres that recently made the headlines for their action against childhood obesity. The Hyperdome early education centre have hired a personal trainer as well as a chef to teach children about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. I would like to congratulate the centre director, Michelle Clarke, and her team for promoting positive and healthy habits within the centre and I wish their chef, Shannon Griffin, and trainer,

        , all the best in their new roles. I look forward to popping into the centre in the near future to check out for myself how the 'healthspiration' program is going.

        We recently had the wonderful Mayor of

        , Pam Parker, announce she would not be contesting the next local government election. Mayor Parker has the upmost respect from members within the Logan community. She has been a mayor of the people and is popular amongst many. Mayor Parker has been a tireless advocate for the Logan community and I wish her all the best in the next chapter of her life. She will be sadly missed in our community.

        It is always wonderful to acknowledge some of the local sporting talent we have in the electorate of Forde and we have a never-ending list of great sports achievers. Today I would like to acknowledge three

        students. Fourteen-year-old Keely Stewart claimed three long-standing records for the 50-metre freestyle, the 50-metre breaststroke and the 50-metre butterfly races at the Pacific Rim District Swimming Championships earlier this year. Her teammate, 17-year-old Ashleigh Holmes, broke two records in the 50-metre backstroke and 50-metre butterfly events. Tayla Raines broke the girls' 16 years 50-metre breaststroke record. Thirty-four students from Canterbury College competed against 18 schools in the district and 27 students went on to the south coast regional swimming championships. Well done to everyone involved, particularly to the parents who dedicate themselves to ensuring their children are given the support they need in order to compete at their best.
