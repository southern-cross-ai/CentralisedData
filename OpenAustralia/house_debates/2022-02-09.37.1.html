       <p>
        In October last year I was pleased to announce almost $2 million for stage 1 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Bridge
        </a>
        regional sports stadium. After much discussion with the local council and the Murray Bridge Basketball Association this funding announcement was a significant milestone in their plans to create a regional stadium at the Murray Bridge showground. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the Murraylands. The Murray Bridge Basketball Association currently has over 500 playing members and is expecting to see this number grow with the region's population, which is booming. This funding is vital as the current stadium simply doesn't comply with Basketball
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">

        standards. It doesn't allow them to host high-level events and it doesn't have the appropriate facilities to encourage female participation in sport. It's holding the sport back at a regional level, and I know that participation in sport helps to make great communities.
       </p>

        The $2 million in funding provides significant support to the council to deliver a new main show court, unisex change rooms, clubrooms and office foyer areas. But it is just stage 1. I am fighting for further funding for future stages of this project because I can see that that would make a real difference to the community of Murray Bridge and surrounds. Great facilities like this one will make stronger communities that are better places to live, work and raise a family.
