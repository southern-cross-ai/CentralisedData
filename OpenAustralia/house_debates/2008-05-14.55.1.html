        I observed during question time—and I think that a number of us did—that there was a little child who started crying in the gallery. I just wanted to ask you a question about your instruction to the attendants just to ensure that we are clear that, if children begin to cry in the gallery, their parents are not asked to leave or made to feel uncomfortable about that and that if they choose to leave voluntarily they have the soundproof gallery pointed out to them because, frankly, with the level of interjection we have, particularly from the members for Sturt, Dickson and Flinders, crying children are like music to our ears.

         First of all, can I go to the last part of that question from the minister. It was not really helpful. Regrettably, I do not think that the barbershop quartet really need any encouragement about their level of interjection. I was hoping that the member for Dunkley could quieten down the other three, but he has not been able to. On the serious matter that the minister raises, it took me a while to work out where the crying was coming from because I think the child was not in my line of sight early on. I observed that there was an attempt to handle it with due consideration. But I take the latter point about whether there was an offer for the proceedings to be observed from the upstairs gallery, which is perhaps something that should be observed. You made the point that, given what goes on during question time, a few sounds of bawling children in the gallery is the least of the House’s worry—and it is the least of the chair’s worries, I can tell you.
