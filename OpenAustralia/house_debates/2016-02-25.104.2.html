        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a fit-out of existing leased premises at 45

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        has substantially reduced the amount of space it will retain in Perth, in line with the agency's accommodation reduction strategy. The reduction in space equates to a saving of $59 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , over seven years, representing an excellent outcome for the Commonwealth. The new fit-out will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of design and operating efficiencies. The proposed works include new workstations, offices and meeting areas, a new security system, conference rooms, training and videoconferencing facilities, a new computer room, and new first-aid rooms and amenity areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to approval of the project by the parliament, the fit-out is expected to commence in early 2016 with staged practical completion scheduled from mid-2017. I commend the motion to the House.

        and Joint Logistics Command units across Australia. The proposed works include new maintenance workshops and associated repair parts stores, weighbridges, loading and inspection ramps, wash points, fuel points, vehicle shelters and associated hardstand. The main works will be delivered in the Townsville and Brisbane regions, with minor works being delivered near Sydney, Puckapunyal, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin. This capital investment in facilities will create economic stimulus, with expected opportunities for local subcontractors over the next three years.

       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. In its report, the committee has recommended that Defence provide a report to the committee on its consultation strategies with the community groups around

        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for, once again, undertaking a timely inquiry.
