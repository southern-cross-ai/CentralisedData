       <p>
        A few weeks ago I visited a year 6 class at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pius_X" rel="nofollow">
         St Pius X
        </a>
        Catholic Primary School in Manning, which is in my electorate of Swan. I know they're watching, so a big hello to all the students at St Pius and their teacher from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        here in Canberra. Their teacher, Mr Paljetak, contacted my office to arrange the visit, as his students are studying civics and citizenship this term. So I went back to school to chat with students about all things politics, my role as their local federal member, how our parliament and democracy work, the work I've done in the electorate of Swan and what motivates me. Of course I said my wife motivates me, and then I went on to tell them about an inherent sense of duty I have to serve the great people of Swan. I was asked about leadership and what it means to me. I could delve into that, but I won't at the moment. I was also very impressed with some of the answers that I received in return when asking the class the same question about leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        I learned that St Pius X had 230 students, which I was able to compare to 226 members and senators that are elected to represent the people of Australia, no matter how far they are from where they hail. I also got to tour the virtual reality room with virtual goggles, allowing students to be transported to wherever or whatever it is they were learning about. I wish some of us could do that sometimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank Mr Paljetak and year sixes for hosting me and look forward to attending their graduation ceremony later in this year.
