       <p>
        The role of an elected member of parliament is first and foremost to represent their constituents and the values of their electorate. Constituency statements like this are an important part of our democracy because it allows elected representatives to highlight their local community in the halls of power, bringing issues of local importance to national attention. One of the great things about my community in Melbourne's north is their engagement with the world around them. They are informed, they care about others and they have an unquenchable desire to create a more just and equal world.
       </p>
       <p>
        While constituency statements typically focus on local issues, it would be remiss of me not to highlight what is happening in Gaza, in Rafah. For my community this is an issue of dire importance; it is an issue that we, as a parliament, cannot ignore. As the member for Cooper, as a long-term supporter of Palestinian liberation and as a person who believes in a just and free world, I must speak up. In the past 48 hours the Netanyahu Israeli government has unleashed a horrific bombing campaign on Rafah. Areas crowded with refugee tents have been flattened. We're seeing images of children suffering and being killed circulated on social media. More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million population have sought refuge in Rafah from the fighting elsewhere. There's simply nowhere else safe left for them to go. The death and destruction are horrific, and this human suffering is unacceptable. Hundreds, thousands in my community are rightly sharing these images to bring attention to the horrific situation in Gaza, to put all eyes on Rafah.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government and the international community have been clear about their views on the planned Israeli offensive in Rafahâ€”that the Israeli government should not have gone down that path. We need an immediate and sustained ceasefire. Israel must comply with the binding orders of the

        </a>
        of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services. International law must be upheld and humanitarian assistance must be allowed to flow into Gaza.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an issue that I feel very strongly about. It is an issue that my constituents feel very strongly about, and I am proud to speak for them here today. Together, we've been active and vocal in calling for support of civilians impacted by the war in Gaza. Together, we welcomed Australia's vote at the

        to support Palestine's bid to become a full member of the organisation. Together, we have consistently called for steps towards a lasting peace in the

        , for the realisation of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people through statehood. My constituents are clear: this war must end.
