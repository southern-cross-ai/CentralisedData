        I rise to pay tribute to the brilliant members of the Bathurst community whose names have been etched into the city's scrolls. These citizens have been recognised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Bathurst Regional Council
        </a>
        as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Legends" rel="nofollow">
         Living Legends
        </a>
        , humble heroes who tirelessly serve and support their community. They don't wear capes, but they are true community champions, determined to build a better city, create a brighter future or simply bring about a lasting smile on the faces of those in our local community. From Dunkeld to Keppel Street to Kelso and everywhere in between, they demonstrate that what counts in life is what we do for others, and they strive mightily to make Bathurst and its surrounding region the best place it can be.

        On the weekend I was thrilled to attend a special presentation honouring the city's Living Legends from the past three years, like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Arthur Davis
        </a>
        , who received legendary status in 2020. Mr Davis's love of rally-car racing saw him compete in the 1977 London to Sydney marathon, the longest car rally in history. Covering three continents and 30,000 kilometres, he would call into 2BS to update Bathurst on how he was tracking. He eventually combined his love of getting behind the wheel with charity, running the Kidney Kar Rally for 17 years with his wife, Kim, to raise vital funds for kids and young people with kidney disease. Other amazing Living Legends from 2020 were George Gaal, David Pennells, Geoffrey Porter, Jane Rawlings and Lachlan Rendall.

        In 2021, Amanda Wilding became a Bathurst Living Legend. Ms Wilding has been volunteering at Daffodil Cottage wig library since it opened more than eight years ago, stocking more than 250 wigs. Amanda assists people undergoing treatment for cancer or who are suffering hair loss to feel like themselves again through finding the perfect new do. Other recipients in 2021 were Soula Aspros, Margaret Bower, Doug Coates, Royce George and Anne Llewellyn.

        This year six Bathurst citizens were recognised: Lyn Cooper, Maureen Markwick, Gloria Packham,

        Congratulations to the Bathurst Living Legends. Your perseverance, courage and kindness leave a legacy we can all look up to.
