        I rise to support the plan to build an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        stadium at Helensvale in my electorate as the home ground for the 17th AFL franchise team, which will come to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . I also rise to call on the Labor state government in Queensland to work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        with respect to including Helensvale as a station for the light-rail hub. Helensvale is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation; it grew by 31.6 per cent between 2001 and 2006. The fact that Helensvale is actually being viewed as a potential home for the new AFL stadium is testimony to the strength of the economy in the local area and the growth in Fadden.
       </p>
       <p>
        The local community in Fadden, particularly in Helensvale, has exploded, with the construction of Helensvale train station, new developments, a shopping centre, and now possibly an AFL stadium. The state government is progressing with light rail, having announced that that will be the preferred way of moving to a mass-transit system. But the closest station to Helensvale that is currently being considered is at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Harbour Town
        </a>
        , which is 5.5 kilometres away. The new stadium, as proved conclusively at Robina stadium, will bring with it new business precincts, increased numbers of tourists and, of course, the tens of thousands of people who come along on game night.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is incongruous to consider that a new light-rail system would go in to provide mass transit across the Gold Coast but would not take it to Helensvale, where the new AFL stadium is proposed to be. There is a railway station at Helensvale for the electric train system, which moves mass numbers of passengers north to Brisbane and south towards the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        border. But there is nothing that moves east-west, which is why having a light-rail station at Helensvale makes an enormous amount of sense. If we assume that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC" rel="nofollow">
         GC
        </a>
        17 bid is successful, as I certainly hope it is, and that the stadium is built at Helensvale, it makes sense to have the light rail there. I join in supporting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Worship" rel="nofollow">
         His Worship
        </a>
        the Mayor Ron Clarke in making sure that a light-rail station is at Helensvale. I hope the Bligh Labor government will seriously review the current light-rail plan and include funding for Helensvale station. I also wish
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC17" rel="nofollow">
         GC17
        </a>
        and their 20,000 supporters—of which I am one—the best of luck in procuring the 17th national team licence to enable AFL to be played on the Gold Coast in 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would also encourage the work of Bravehearts and its founder and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Hetty Johnson. It was great to see so many members of both parties wearing a Bravehearts badge to recognise and support White Balloon Day next Tuesday, 9 September, and National Child Protection Week next week. Our society and, indeed I—and I hope I speak for all members of parliament—will not accept child sexual assault or abuse in our communities. It is interesting that Bravehearts reported that, as a result of the first White Balloon Day and other initiatives, the number of disclosures of child sexual assault increased by over 500 per cent. I encourage the community to support the great work of Bravehearts and other child advocate organisations. I especially encourage them to make a stand and a statement next week, particularly on Tuesday, 9 September for White Balloon Day.
