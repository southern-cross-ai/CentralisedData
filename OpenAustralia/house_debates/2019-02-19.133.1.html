        Established communities like the electorate of Goldstein have their own unique challenges that every government needs to be mindful of. The reality is that every day thousands of residents in Goldstein get up, go to work—they might work in professional services or labour jobs—and commute into town. Often residents complain to me about the fact that they can't get a car park after 7.30 at many of the important train stations across the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        We hear that, and that's why I'm so proud that the Morrison government has provided $4 million for the Hampton train station on the Sandy line for 133 new car parks in addition to the 25 that have been promised by

        . We have heard directly from the concerns of constituents, and we are taking action. It sits as part of a broader package of $121 million being invested in infrastructure across the south-east of Melbourne because the Morrison government understands the challenges that Melburnians face on a day-to-day basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making sure that there is proper car parking at train stations makes a huge difference in alleviating the pressure that sits at the heart of the daily commute of many professional workers and, as I said, labourers. It means that there are fewer cars on the streets. It means that there's less traffic clogging up our residential streets, and it reduces pollution as well.

        Established communities like Goldstein have unique challenges in facing some of the difficulties of daily commutes for many professional service workers and labourers as well. Many residents complain to me often about not being able to get a car spot at 7.30 in the morning if they don't get to the train station by then to get to work. That's why the Morrison government is delivering $4 million investing in new car parking: 143 new car parks at Bentleigh train station on the Frankston line. It sits as part of a package of $121 million that the Morrison government is spending on infrastructure in the south-east of Melbourne because the Morrison government fundamentally understands the challenges that face Melburnians. You have spoken and we have acted.

        This is critical infrastructure if we want to reduce the number of cars on our roads. It is critical infrastructure if we want to be able to reduce the number of cars parked in residential streets and also in making sure that there is less pollution, as part of cleaning up our wonderful city. It will take the pressure off people's daily commutes and improve people's lives so they can spend more time with their family at the start of the day and of course will assist them in being able to get home sooner at the end of the day as well. It's these important projects across south-east Melbourne that make all the difference in improving the lives of Goldstein residents.
