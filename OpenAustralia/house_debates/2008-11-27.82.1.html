        I want to report to the Committee about a recent rescue on Lord
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howe_Island" rel="nofollow">

        .

         Lord Howe Island
        </a>
        is part of my electorate of Sydney. One of my constituents, Pam Goyen, a resident of Lord Howe Island, wrote to me about an incident, which was also reported in the marvellous local paper, the
        <i>
         Lord Howe Island Signal
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Climbing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gower" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gower
        </a>
        is a serious challenge. I can show you the view from the top of Mount Gower. It is an all-day walk. It is one that I have done, and I must say there are parts of it that are quite terrifying. One part of the walk is along a ledge. This article describes it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ledge is an overstatement, so is Jan’s 50 centimetres. There’s a rope attached to the cliffside on the left and I’m told to use it for safety but my hands are sweating and I fear I will slip. To my right, as far as the eye can see, is the ocean, where the wind swallows your screams; beneath me, a cliff that plunges hundreds of metres to the sea.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently a woman who was on her return from this walk slipped and broke her leg very badly and was losing blood. She was in a party led by an experienced guide, Jack Shick, with an assistant guide, John Trey. I have climbed the mountain with Jack Shick and indeed he is a marvellous guide. They were able to apply first aid and stop the bleeding. But it took 25 wonderful people, including the relieving doctor and nurse, to walk back up the mountain and stretcher this woman down in the dark on a slippery, muddy track.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot tell you how difficult this track is for people who are able-bodied, but carrying someone else down the track is indeed a phenomenal act of bravery. Not only was it dark and muddy but there were also strong winds and part of the track is literally only wide enough for one person, with sheer cliff falls down to the ocean and the sharp rocks on the other side. Lord Howe Island is a small remote island. As Pam Goyen said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over there you’d have a rescue helicopter and all that goes with it but this was done by manpower and God’s grace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The air ambulance cannot land on the Lord Howe Island airstrip after dark—it is not lit—so another visitor to the island chartered a small aircraft and had this woman taken back to the mainland for medical treatment. It was a marvellous rescue, a tribute to the islanders. I would be happy to support nominations for bravery awards for all of those who were involved in the rescue. I should also add that the government has recently provided $560,000 in funding under the Caring for our Country grants scheme for the eradication of rats and weeds, which was much needed and well received by the islanders of Lord Howe Island.
