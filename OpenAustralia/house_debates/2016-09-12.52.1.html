        I rise today to speak about those amazing athletes who represented Barker at the Rio 2016 Olympics. To represent Australia at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Games
        </a>
        is an honour not many young people will have the opportunity or talent to achieve. To display one's talent, hard work, sacrifice and dedication on such a vast international stage takes determination and guts. Our 2016 Olympic squad for Rio comprised 442 athletes across 26 sports. On average then there were 2.8 athletes per division. Of course some electorates turned out more athletes than others this year. My electorate of Barker, for instance, was represented by five superstars and I would like to pay tribute to these young athletes who have made Barker,

        and indeed Australia proud.

        from the Riverland may have come to rowing late in life but he has certainly made his mark on the sporting world. Alex has inspired young rowers in his home town of Loxton North by winning a silver medal at the Olympic Games as a member of the coxless fours.

        is another home-town talent, rowing for the Murray Bridge Rowing Club—the home of the famous Murray Cods. Like his colleague from the Riverland, James also claimed silver—this time in the quad sculls.

        not only breeds strong rowers but is also home to two of Australia's elite hockey players: Karri McMahon and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgie_Parker" rel="nofollow">

        . Both did Berri, Barker and our nation proud as Hockeyroos. Of course, the south-east was represented by Jess Trengrove, the marathon runner from Naracoorte, who placed 22nd out of a field of 133 athletes.
