        , edited by his daughter Ana Scarf and granddaughter Charlotte Scarf. It was a great honour to be invited to launch the book, and it was a lovely afternoon in the grounds of historic Hagley House, listening to the reflections on his extraordinary life, edited from his own recorded recollections in this fine book.

        Wordsworth retired from the Indian Army in 1947 and settled on a farm near Westbury in northern Tasmania, continuing his love of sporting pursuits such as polo and fly-fishing. He stood unsuccessfully at the state election in 1948 in the seat of Wilmot, now Lyons, and then agreed to attempt the Senate in 1949 and was successful. He served as a Liberal senator for Tasmania until 1959. Wordsworth considered his 10 years as a senator the unhappiest of his life, soldiering having been his profession. 'A soldier,' he wrote, 'is trained to be concise in speech and to act quickly and decisively,' while, 'a politician must be a talker above all else.' He came to abhor uninformed criticism, particularly in debate. After his parliamentary career he served as

        Ana did suggest to me, ahead of the launch, that perhaps I'd like to ponder on the life of a politician today compared to the 1950s when her father began his almost 10-year political career. Although we're generations apart and politics today is markedly different to when Senator Wordsworth represented the people of Tasmania as a Liberal senator, I was pleasantly surprised to find that we had a lot more in common than I had first thought. It's a great book and a remarkable life. Congratulations to Ana and Charlotte in bringing to life his entertaining and amazing life adventures. The book is published by Forty South Tasmania.
