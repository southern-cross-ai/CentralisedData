        Last week I met with pharmacists in my electorate and spoke to the Pharmacy Guild about the COVID vaccine rollout that pharmacists are now assisting with and the impact that this is having on pharmacists, as some of the core frontline workers responsible for COVID vaccinations. One of the pharmacists I met with, which was at TerryWhite Chemmart in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , was doing her part to save lives, working very hard in administering as many vaccines as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the meeting there were some serious concerns raised regarding current practices and requirements by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        , which imposed time-consuming procedures for the minimum amount of remuneration. Pharmacists only receive $16 for the first vaccination. If they're lucky and the person goes back for their second vaccination, they'll get $26. For the upcoming boosters they've been told they'll only be given $16. This is an enormous amount of work. They're facing lots of pressure. If we're serious about rolling out the booster vaccinations, we should look at remunerating pharmacists accordingly. General practitioners currently receive anything from $42 to $74 for a vaccination. It's my understanding that the COVID vaccination distribution has proven to be excessively demanding. I've been told it is laborious and overwhelming, which is not reflected in a mere $16.
