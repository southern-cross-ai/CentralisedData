        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. If Adani, as reported, leaves Australia, 500 million Indians will go without lights and the world will suffer, as low-grade Indian coal and cheap technology belch eruptions of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        , with the highest unemployment and crime rates, will lose Adani's $3 billion in exports—and the other Galilee mine's $6 billion—and 90,000 jobs. Minister, can you meet with the budgerigar leadership of Queensland and impose upon Galilee coal advanced ultracritical technology and superhybrid carbon capture gumtree plantations and initiate a government authority to build an Australian-owned, multi-user clean electric rail line?

         I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I am very happy to meet with the delegation, as he proposes. He knows that the decision about the rail line is to be made by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, but he also knows that the Carmichael mine has received all its Commonwealth and state approvals and has been warmly welcomed by the people of

           but not of Jackie Trad, as I understand, because there is now division in the state government. We know where the member for Dawson stands on the Carmichael mine. We know where the member for Capricornia stands on the Carmichael mine. We know where the deputy leader of the government and the Prime Minister stand, but we do not know where the member for Herbert stands, because the member for Herbert was happy to go to the Townsville port with the head of Adani and the local mayor and have her photo taken as Adani announced that Townsville would become their headquarters.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is 11 per cent unemployment in Townsville. Youth unemployment is some double that. The member for Herbert has now gone quiet, and so has the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition goes to Townsville and says he is all for jobs and apprentices, but when he goes to the rest of the country he says it is too hard. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who said, 'If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.' This is the same Leader of the Opposition who said, 'I don't know what
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
            Julia Gillard

           said, but I agree with her.' This is the same Leader of the Opposition who sold out the workers of Clean Event. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who sold out the owner-operator truck drivers. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who sold out volunteer firefighters. When the lights are on, the member for Herbert and the Leader of the Opposition will say what they think you want to hear, but when the lights are off and you need their help—as the people of Adani are now finding out—the member for Herbert and the Leader of the Opposition are nowhere to be seen.
