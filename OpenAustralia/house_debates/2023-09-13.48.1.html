        , Craig Fielding, Anne Guirguis and Max Carias are six of the 1,700 employees that were left hanging in limbo following the decision by Qantas to outsource their jobs under the cover of the COVID pandemic some three years ago. Baggage handlers, cleaners, ground staff—good, honest, hard-working Aussies left without jobs. Last night I had the opportunity and privilege to sit down and share a meal with these workers and to hear their stories that began three years ago and that would hopefully reach a conclusion in the High Court today. In particular, Max Carias, who I represented in the early stages of their dispute—in all honesty I've never met a more selfless person than Max—filled me in on a few details that needed to be told. Of the workers that he represented, 14 of his colleagues went broke and lost absolutely everything—their house, their car, the lot. Of those, eight lost their marriages, their families as they knew it. This is the human cost of Qantas's decision to outsource.

        Earlier this morning, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         High Court of Australia
        </a>
        sided with workers and dismissed Qantas's appeal in a unanimous judgement. Congratulation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        and to the 1,700 workers who have rightfully been vindicated by taking on Goliath, fighting the good fight and winning with their backs against the ropes. Congratulations to those great workers up in the gallery today.
