        Today I have been contacted by the Patronato office in Oakleigh, in my electorate, by Sebastian Rustica, who has been doing an amazing job since 1980. Patronato provides free advice on Italian social security matters to members of the Italian community and is supported by the Italian government. The Patronato office in Oakleigh has been assisting the Italian community with queries around pension entitlements from Italy and also those relating to the Italo-Australian social security agreement between Italy and Australia that has been in place for 30 years. However, this is now under threat. I quote from a letter I received on this matter today, which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part of the extreme measures proposed by the RENZI Government and currently awaiting Parliament approval, is a massive blow of 150 million Euros to the "PATRONA 77" which if passed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Italian Parliament
        </a>
        will translate into a loss of 6000 jobs and the inevitable closure of all Patronati Offices outside of Italy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If that is the case the Australian Department of Human Services will have to pick up the pieces as Centrelink will have to assist all Italians currently receiving an Italian pension granted under the Italo-Australian Social Security Agreement.
       </p>

        My electorate of Chisholm, which is home to many who benefit from these services, will no longer be able to access them. Currently, 3,000 people a year go to the Oakleigh office. It is an invaluable community service. People who are involved in it, such as Tony Torsselo, know how well utilised it is. Tony is currently the Vice President Patronato Rai Uil Association of Oakleigh and President of the

        club, which I have been pleased to go to on many occasions. He knows how damaging this would be. He and Sebastian are asking people to come down to the Patronato office at 8 Station Street, Oakleigh, to sign the petition to stop this ridiculous closure of these valuable offices.
