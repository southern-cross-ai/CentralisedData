        Australia has one of the highest emissions of carbon dioxide per capita, yet the Abbott government is not only not taking action but repealing action taken by previous governments. They are remaining indifferent to action on climate change, and it is humiliating on a global scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        Renewable energy is a significant aspect of ensuring a sustainable future, and it is unacceptable to ignore this, as the Prime Minister did so recently, describe wind turbines as 'ugly', 'noisy' and 'visually awful'. He additionally stated that he wished the Howard government, in which he was a senior minister, had never implemented the renewable energy target policy. Wind turbines and other renewable energy sources offer great reductions in

        emissions and are crucial to protecting our environment. The immature view that the Prime Minister voiced towards them shows the short-sighted perspective his government holds towards sustainability.

        government has also greatly cut Australia's foreign aid contributions. Less economically developed countries will be worst hit by the consequences of climate change, even though they have contributed the least. It is clear that the Abbott government has a narrow-minded view of Australia's place and responsibility internationally. It is intolerable for Australia as a nation with the resources available to it to simply sit back and dismiss any action on the matter.

       <p>
        Future generations will be resentful towards and disappointed in us when they are faced with the tremendous consequences they will experience because of climate change. History will depict us poorly; and, when asked why no action was taken, the only answer will be: because some people wanted to maximise short-term profits for a few large companies and because they thought renewable energy was 'visually awful.'
