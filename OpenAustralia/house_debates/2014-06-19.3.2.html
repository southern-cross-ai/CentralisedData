        I move:

        (3) at the conclusion of the proceedings on

         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 1) 2014-2015,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) separate questions being put without further debate on the motions for the second readings and any further motions necessary to conclude consideration of the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015, and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) then the question being put without further debate on the motion for the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-2014, and then the bill being considered in detail for a period not exceeding 15 minutes, at which time any questions necessary to conclude the detail stage being put, and any questions being put without further debate on any further motions necessary to conclude consideration of the bill; and
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion is to amend the debate management motion applying to the appropriation bills and order to allow an amendment to later be moved to Appropriation Bill (No. 6), which I anticipate will be on Monday. The amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14 was circulated earlier this week to insert a schedule that was omitted unfortunately during the printing process. The error arose in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel's printing process for Appropriation Bill (No. 6) that resulted in the omission of a schedule. We are obviously looking at the bill proofing processes to guard against future problems but these things do happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The debate management motion currently applying to the appropriation bills did not anticipate the need to amend the appropriation bills. This motion thus allows a consideration in detail period for Appropriation Bill (No. 6) during which a motion to correct the error will be moved by the government before finally voting on the bill. The motion to correct the error and insert the missing schedule we moved here in the House. I understand the opposition intends not to oppose this motion and I thank them for their support.
