        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Can the minister tell the House how repealing the carbon tax will reduce the price of diesel, petrol and aviation fuel? How will this benefit flow to the entire community, particularly my electorate of Flynn? What might the consequences be if the carbon tax is not removed quickly?

         The member's electorate covers one of the most important industrial areas in our country. Mining, exports and minerals processing are all industries that are made less competitive because Labor put a carbon tax in place. So the real benefits to the people of Gladstone will be a stronger and more robust economy and more competitive industries. But it will also flow through to almost everything they do in their daily lives, whether it is the forklift in the factory; the council undertaking some roadworks; the boats, the dredges and the ferries working in Gladstone harbour; getting a ticket at the airport to fly to another part of the country; or getting on the tilt train in the morning. All of those costs are higher because of Labor's carbon tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let us never forget that on 1 July 2013, just as the leader who dumped the emissions trading scheme then dumped the Prime Minister who promised we would not have a carbon tax ever, the carbon tax went up again. If Labor are allowed to keep its carbon tax in place, the prices will go up again and again. As if they have not done enough damage; Labor want to keep the carbon tax in place. In fact, they cannot make up their mind whether they want a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. I think they want both. They want to put more penalties on the Australian people. They do not want Australian industries to be competitive and be able to deliver products at a competitive price around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that Labor are imposing a cost not just on ordinary Australians in their households, not just on the day-to-day things that we do in our lives but, worst of all, on our industry and on our national competitiveness. The answer to the people of Flynn and the answer to the people of Australia is for Labor to recognise that the people have spoken on this issue and to support us to axe the tax.
