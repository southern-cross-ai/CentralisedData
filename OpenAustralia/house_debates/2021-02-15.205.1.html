       <p>
        Today we were confronted with yet another shocking revelation of alleged sexual harassment within this building. I do not use the word 'shocked', because, sadly, I'm not. My heart goes out to the young woman, Brittany Higgins, who came forward with her story. But how many times do we have to be confronted by headlines before anything's done? How many times do we have to listen to those opposite use sanitised language, such as 'extremely distressing', before systematic change is enacted? Why is it that time and time again it takes a brave and often young woman to put herself in the firing line of public opinion, to put her job on the line, before parliament discusses this issue and we review behaviours, guidelines and governance?

        Every person who comes to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        has the right to a safe workplace and positive culture. This is not the first time a victim has come forward, and we have the chance for it to be the last. On days like this I think of my two young daughters, who are about to enter the workforce. They, like all women, deserve to be treated with dignity, with respect and without fear of reprisal when they need to speak up. We have let so many women before Brittany down. Every day that we go without systemic and cultural change we let others down, too. Let's work together and make change so that women can be comfortable, safe and secure in this place.
