        I promised my community that I would spend this week fighting to fix the vaccine rollout, for fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities and for financial support for Victorians during our lockdown.

Lucky it's not a race to provide Australians with a COVIDSafe app. Lucky it's apparently not a race to have fit-for-purpose quarantine, notwithstanding there have been 17 breaches and my community is in lockdown. The Prime Minister has abandoned my community and has notâ€”
