        today is mourning the loss of one of its greatest servants and greatest leaders. Unexpectedly on Friday, following complications after a surgical procedure, National Secretary

        sadly passed away. I extend my deepest condolences to Alanna, his wife, and to his family. Dave was decent, wise, humble and compassionate. His sage advice and insightful counsel were appreciated by colleagues and friends. He was a mentor to many. He was a humble man. His extraordinary and amazing contribution to the quality of life for working Australians can't be underestimated.
       </p>

        David Smith started work on the shop floor as a clerk for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Rail" rel="nofollow">

        and got involved in the union at a young age. He was the state secretary of the Queensland branch in 2001, having been the assistant secretary since 1993. In 2011, he was elected as national secretary and he brought cohesion and unity to the union. The Australian Services Union says he ran the equal pay case in the Queensland state commission which provides pay increases over eight years for social and community services workers.

        Under Dave's leadership, the union delivered the first ever workplace agreement with provision for domestic violence leave—what a tribute that alone is—and his contribution to superannuation and his expertise were invaluable to working women in this country. Dave, vale; thank you very much for what you've done.
