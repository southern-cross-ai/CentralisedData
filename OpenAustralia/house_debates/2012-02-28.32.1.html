        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister please outline to the House how the government's record investment in duplicating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        is creating jobs today while building the nation for the future, and are there any obstacles to achieving full duplication of the highway by 2016?

         I thank the member for Page for her question. I am glad I can get a question on infrastructure and transport from this side of the House because, no matter what I do, it is pretty hard to get one from the other side of the House. They just simply will not ask a question on these issues, because they are not interested in infrastructure and transport.

           Right now, today, there are more than 1,600 workers on site working on the

           to Stills Road.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a vital road on which more than 800 people have lost their lives over the last 20 years. It is an important national priority for us and it has been a priority for the

           government in the past. I wrote to the New South Wales roads minister last month and included a works plan to achieve duplication by 2016. I table my letter to Minister Gay and the work plan. Both Minister Gay and New South Wales Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner have acknowledged that 2016 is achievable. That is why I was disappointed that Minister Gay responded to my correspondence not by writing to me but by giving a letter to the newspapers saying that they would not continue with fifty-fifty funding for the Pacific Highway.

           This week the

            NRMA
           </a>
           has called them out. NRMA President Wendy Machin said this in calling for New South Wales to meet its fair share:

           It was the

           </a>
           that set the 50-50 funding split for the Pacific Highway from 2006 and the NRMA has supported this approach since day one.

           Whilst we have been getting on with the job, what we have seen from those opposite—the member for Cowper—is, first, he said it was not a federal problem when he called the Pacific Highway a state road. Then he said dollar-for-dollar funding should be provided for New South Wales. Then, when we put in $1 billion, they said there was not enough construction. They said it does not actually build roads. But now, this week, in defending the inaction from his coalition colleagues he said, 'Go to Sapphire, to Woolgoolga or to Kempsey and look at the scale of the work that is happening and ask yourself where you are going to replicate that six more times.' Now they say there is too much work taking place on the Pacific Highway, and it is not possible. I say to those opposite—
