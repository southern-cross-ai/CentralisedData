         <p>
          Yesterday I was asked by the member for Oxley about allegations concerning the salaries being paid to the 40 Filipino welders at Dartbridge Welding claiming that they were at least 20 per cent below the market rates for welders in Brisbane. I indicated to the House that the matter was being investigated. I can now update the House on the progress of those investigations. I am advised that the Office of Workplace Services conducted a site visit yesterday in relation to these companies. However, information is not yet available regarding any findings they may have reached.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am also advised that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
          </a>
          attempted to interview the workers yesterday with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
           AMWU
          </a>
          —that is the relevant union—present but the union refused to assist. However, at this stage, the only information available is the allegations made in the media, which are being investigated by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWS" rel="nofollow">
           OWS
          </a>
          . I am also advised that the department attempted to meet the workers yesterday through the AMWU. I am told that the AMWU declined the department’s request to obtain the workers’ allegations firsthand and to explain their visa situation.
         </p>
         <p>
          In accordance with its desires to work with the AMWU to quickly address such allegations, the department’s Deputy State Director in Queensland spoke to the AMWU National Secretary, Mr Doug Cameron, yesterday. I am advised that the AMWU thanked the department for the offer to meet with the workers but declined, indicating that the AMWU were advising the workers. This approach to the AMWU followed an earlier general approach from DIMA to establish a cooperative approach to ensuring cases are properly investigated.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 18 September—that is exactly a month ago—DIMA wrote to the AMWU suggesting a protocol for reporting potential breaches of section 457 visa conditions to ensure they are properly investigated in a timely fashion. DIMA has had no response so far to that letter. Given the union’s unwillingness to assist investigations, the department is looking at other options to contact the individuals to investigate the claims.
         </p>
         <p>
          Could I take this opportunity in the national parliament to appeal to the workers—and to appeal to the media, if they are in touch with the workers, to encourage the workers—to get in touch with the department so that we can investigate the claims. I issue that appeal very genuinely. The department would like to talk to the workers. The department is very happy to have the union present. But, to date, the evidence suggests that the union does not want the men interviewed by the department. That is the evidence to date. I could be proved wrong—although, when it comes to industrial relations matters, the wrong facts have all been on the other side in recent weeks. So far it looks as though the union and the Labor Party, in its guilt by association—

           On this issue it is. There is not much doubt. We know where the unions stand, and from that we know where the Labor Party will be told to stand when the time comes. They are not really interested in helping these workers; they are only interested in running a miserable media campaign. Again, I appeal to these workers—and I appeal to the media to encourage them—to get in touch with the department. They will investigate the claims and get to the bottom of this. If the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">

           are serious about the welfare of the workers, as distinct from scoring political points, they will encourage them to take up the department’s offer.
