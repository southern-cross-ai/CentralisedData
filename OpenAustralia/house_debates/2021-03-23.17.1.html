       <p>
        Today I rise to pay tribute to a dedicated servant of the north-west coast of Tasmania, Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Johnston" rel="nofollow">
         Ivan Johnston
        </a>
        , who recently passed away aged 84. Ivan's legacy is one of service, achievement, leadership, loyalty and mentorship. At 18, Ivan undertook national service and in 1973 joined the Army reserve, where he was a musician and drum major with the Australian Army Band for 13 years. He undertook leadership roles with the National Servicemen's Association, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , Rotary and lawn bowls clubs across the region. For 37 years, Ivan led the region's much loved Ulverstone Municipal Band as drum major. He commenced with the band in 1964, was appointed drum major in 1973 and continued to play with the band until last year. If you attend an event on the north-west coast of Tasmania the Ulverstone Municipal Band will be there to entertain you. For four decades, it was led by Ivan Johnston. Ivan's long list of achievements includes the National Band Council of Australia 50 years-plus award, the Tasmanian Band League life member award and the badge of honour. He was drum major 15 times at a national level and five times at an international level. Ivan was a true gentleman. He was generous in giving to all. He will be deeply missed but he will always be respected.
