        thank the Deputy Speaker, the member for Maranoaâ€”he is a good bloke. I want to concur with his comments and observations about the workings of this place, and how we should respect one another. I thank you very much and wish everyone in this place, and your families, a Merry Christmas.

        I want to briefly talk about the commemorative events held on the

        I will not have time to describe all of the events that happened, but I do want to thank a number of people for their engagement. As the federal member representing the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, I would like to acknowledge the many Cocos Islanders and those from other places, past and present, who contributed to making the event such a success.

        The events that I was able to participate in were very memorable and are a tribute to their desire to make sure that this event is remembered, because it was the most important naval battle of the
