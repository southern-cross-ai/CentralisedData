       <p>
        It's so apropos that you're in the chair, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, for my statement this afternoon, because I want to talk about the enormous pride that I take representing the amazing Greek community in my electorate of Hotham. With your Greek heritage, you'll know much of what I'm about to say to the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's well understood that Melbourne has, I think, the highest Greek population outside of Greece of any city in the world. I have the enormous privilege of representing what I think is the second-largest Greek community in the city of Melbourne. It's centred around the suburb of Oakleigh. I represent well over 7,000 Greek-Australians in that suburb. It is also where my home is, so not only do I get to enjoy the amazing benefits of Greek culture through my work as a local member of parliament but also as a neighbour to so many Greek friends who live around me. We talk a lot about, in Melbourne in particular, how much multiculturalism improves our lives as Australian citizens.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_I" rel="nofollow">
         Sometimes I
        </a>
        feel that conversation can take on a tone that is a bit frivolous. For example, we talk a lot about the food—although Greek food is amazing—and about things like dancing and that sort of stuff. We get to enjoy those things in abundance in Hotham, because of the great generosity of our Greek friends and neighbours. But I want to speak a little more about something deeper, which is the values and the mindset that this community really brings to my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't think anyone will be in any doubt of the thought leadership that Greeks have brought to Australia, as the inventors of so many different kinds of thinking of philosophy, psychology and other areas. Something I think a lot of Australians do not know about is the very proud history that Greece has in fighting fascism. Luckily for me, every October in my electorate, we get to celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohi_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Ohi Day
        </a>
        , which is a very important moment for the Greek community. In 1940 when Europe was in the throes of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , this was a moment where Greece was under threat from Italy, under the fascist Mussolini. Mussolini gave the Greeks an ultimatum to join him or to become an enemy. Ohi is the Greeks saying no. They said no to fascism and, instead, said yes to democracy—a pivotal moment in Greek history. It's something I know that so many of my Greek constituents are incredibly proud of. I'm proud of them for that too.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that's also fantastic about the Greek community I represent is a deep interest in politics. It is a double-edged sword, of course. When I do my street stalls in Oakleigh, I certainly don't have any shortage of people to talk to. What I love about the engagement I have with the community is that we have these very well-informed and extremely animated and energetic conversations about politics, and then we hug and I get kisses and people talk to me about my children and my family. It's this beautiful passion for politics and an understanding of how important it is to our lives as Australians that I feel simpatico with my Greek-Australian constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has also just been Orthodox Easter, which is the most important religious event on the Orthodox Greek calendar. I love this celebration. I get to enjoy so many delicious Greek treats. I get to dance and sing with my constituents. I had a wonderful time this year at the St Agnes' Parish in Springvale where I celebrated with their senior citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a senior citizens lunch, but, I have to say, they didn't look like that on the dance floor! It was wonderful. I want to say to my Greek constituents [Greek language not transcribed]. I've no doubt got that totally wrong, but I'm having a go. In closing I just want to say [Greek language not transcribed] to all my amazing Greek constituents. It's such a privilege to be you're local member for parliament. Thank you for all you do to make our community a better place.
