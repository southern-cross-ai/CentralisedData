           , protecting Australia's maritime borders and keeping peace on the high seas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Decisions are made in this building that result in the men and women of our Australian Defence Force leaving family, friends and safety in Australia to go overseas to do what needs to be done to defend Australia and our national interests. In debating this motion today we remind ourselves of every one of the 2,000 men and women who are deployed overseas. There are thousands of people left behind who will miss them. There are children who will go months without seeing one of their parents, and partners who will shoulder the responsibility of looking after kids and managing households without their significant other. There are parents who will never stop worrying about their grown sons and daughters. There are friends and colleagues who will go without the company of their mates.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, there are the risks that the men and women who are deployed take so that we do not have to take them. They face threats abroad so that we do not have to face them here. As we sit in the chamber and debate this motion the crew of

           . Personnel of Operation Accordion will be working in various locations around the Middle East making sure that everything and everyone is in the right place at the right time. The crews of Operation Resolute will be patrolling the tropical waters to our nation's north, working alongside Border Force to shut down the evil and reckless people-smuggling trade, which has cost many lives. Each of these men and women is sacrificing something—safety, comfort, time at home, time with their family—so that we do not have to. We as a government and as people owe a huge debt to each of these men and women of the Defence Force. I ask my colleagues as representatives of the government and the people of Australia to join with me in thanking these and men and women of the Australian Defence Force for their outstanding service and also their families who are making an enormous sacrifice for our country.

           <p>
            I thank the member for Solomon for this motion today, and I also rise to pay tribute to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            personnel and the critical role they play in supporting and advancing Australia's national interests. I do not think there is a person in this place who would not agree that, when it comes to defence capability, our single, biggest asset is our people—the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. It is their courage, their dedication, their bravery and their commitment that make our Defence Force what it is—a world-class defence force. This is especially the case for those currently serving overseas, and of course their families back home in Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we have heard, there are currently more than 2,100 ADF personnel serving overseas. That number includes more than 900 personnel deployed in Iraq as part of Operation
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okra" rel="nofollow">
             Okra
            </a>
            , more than 600 personnel in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

            </a>

            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitou" rel="nofollow">
             Manitou
            </a>
            and more than 400 personnel in Afghanistan as part of Operation Highroad. I have seen firsthand the contribution these personnel make in securing our nation and its interests. I have seen firsthand the fundamental role they play in delivering aid and humanitarian assistance, following earthquakes or tsunamis, as we saw in South-East Asia. I have also seen firsthand the work they do for the communities that they live in overseas.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2011, I had the opportunity to go to Afghanistan as part of the Defence subcommittee. We were in Kabul, Tarin Kot and Kandahar. One of the experiences that had a really profound effect on me was going to Mirabad Valley, which had just recently been pacified by our ADF. We had gathered around the community members—all men; I was the only woman there—to talk with them, to get an understanding of what the situation was and what a difference stability meant for their daily lives. There was this young Australian ADF member there who would have been in his twenties. He had built up a very strong relationship with that community. In a way, he was like a rock star for that community. They looked up to him, even though he was very young. He was probably 40 or 50 years younger than some of the men gathered in this group, yet he obviously had such respect from that community because he had built up a strong relationship with them and had helped stabilise their community. It was incredibly profound. I imagine that that young man is back here now, immersed in some base somewhere, yet he was, as I said, like a rock star to that community. They literally looked up at him. It was quite extraordinary. As I said, I have seen the work that the ADF does in terms of benefiting and advancing the nation-building elements of these communities overseas. When the ADF members do that, they become a member of their new community, as in the case of this young man in Mirabad Valley, in Afghanistan, because they are so far away from their families here in Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like the member for Solomon, I acknowledge and thank all ADF personnel. I also want to use my contribution to say a special thank you to the families, because it is difficult to imagine just how tough it would be for the families of ADF personnel who are serving overseas. Last week, I had the honour of attending the annual dinner of the Defence Families of Australia national conference, where I met with some extraordinary men and women—there were a few men there but it was mainly women—who are strong, committed, resilient, articulate, highly intelligent and advancing the cause of the broader ADF community. They are incredibly powerful women. Congratulations to Robyn Ritchie and to all the members of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA" rel="nofollow">
             DFA
            </a>
            who contribute in such a significant way. As we know, they have to pick up and start new lives in different cities every two or three years, with the posting cycle. They have got to do the parenting alone when their spouse is deployed overseas. They are separated for long periods from their loved one, and often their loved one is in a dangerous position. They are extraordinary supports for the ADF personnel, and they do an extraordinary job in contributing to our nation's capability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, to Australia's defence personnel both at home and abroad, I say thank you to their families. You have the strong support of this parliament. You have the strong support of the Australian people. We are proud of you, and we appreciate the very great sacrifice you have made and are making.

             personnel, and I commend her for her support for ADF personnel in her electorate. I am proud to stand with other members today to acknowledge the dedication, bravery and sacrifice of the outstanding men and women of the Australian Defence Force, particularly those currently serving overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yesterday, I paid my respects at a commemoration service for the 49th anniversary of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
              Battle of Long Tan
             </a>
             , held in my electorate of Dobell. Whilst I joined with others across the nation to pay our respects to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on foreign shores, I could not help but think of the current generation of men and women in our Defence Force who are serving overseas, particularly those whom I was privileged to meet in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">

             and Afghanistan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Currently, there are over 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed in overseas operations to protect Australia's national interest, to support our international partners and to help maintain global peace and security. Recent deployments include troops primarily from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Australian Army
             </a>
             7th Brigade in Brisbane, who have been deployed as part of the Building Partner Capacity mission in Iraq, to train Iraqi army personnel in their fight against Daesh. I was privileged to travel with the men and women of this deployment last April, when I participated in the ADF Parliamentary Program. Being able to participate in this program and meet with ADF personnel deployed in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
              Middle East
             </a>
             and Afghanistan was a huge honour and an experience I will treasure forever. Over the week the parliamentary group met with ADF personnel serving at Al Minhad and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Dhafra" rel="nofollow">
              Al Dhafra
             </a>
             and in Kabul. I want to thank those I met for their hospitality, openness and frankness in sharing personal stories and views—and it was great to meet a Dobell local, Ken.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a mother I could not help but see the faces of my children in these young men and women that we joined during our induction on arrival in the UAE. I am in awe of the professionalism, attitude and dedication of these young people. During our briefings we met with ADF personnel in their places of work. It was inspiring to see the many postcards and drawings which had been sent by Australian children that they had on display. The troops mentioned the excitement of receiving a care package and how much it meant to them to know that people back home were thinking of them.

             scouts, my office sent care packages, and I recall our excitement when we received thanks from the troops who had received our packages.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our troops are an amazing group of individuals who ask for nothing. However, a simple message or a token of care does mean a lot to them. I encourage every proud Australian to let these men and women know how much they are valued and honoured. There are numerous ways in which the Australian public can show their appreciation, including by sending an email message or a postcard to the troops and, as I mentioned before, by care packages, which can be sent via

            <p>
             During our many conversations we learnt a lot about the families back in Australia. Whilst we are acutely aware of the sacrifice of those on overseas deployment, it is important that we acknowledge the families of service personnel here in Australia. Recently I was honoured to present a certificate of service to Afghanistan veteran Darren Sharpe. During our meeting I spoke with Darren's wife and met two of their children. Darren's wife spoke of the challenges faced by Defence families, particularly when a spouse is deployed overseas. Many of our ADF service personnel have undertaken numerous overseas deployments, and one can only imagine the strain that this can place on a relationship. I believe we owe it to Defence families to ensure that, in the absence of their loved ones, they receive the ultimate respect and support they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to expressing my gratitude to our ADF service personnel, I wish to mention and pay tribute to the 41 photographs proudly displayed at the Al Minhad and Kabul military bases. The 41 faces of those who served proudly but did not come home are etched in my memory. On behalf of the Dobell community and all Australians: lest we forget. To these brave men and their families, we are indebted to you forever for your bravery and your ultimate sacrifice. To all our troops overseas: stay safe. I commend this motion to the House.

             <p>
              It gives me great pleasure to participate in this debate. I think it is extremely important to acknowledge all
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Defence Force
              </a>
              personnel, whether they are at home or overseas. We know that there are 2,100 Australians currently serving overseas. However, for them to be able serve overseas requires the support of tens of thousands of Defence Force members here in Australia who, by doing the training and the work back home, make it possible for their Defence Force brothers and sisters to be deployed. I want to thank all of them and recognise their ongoing commitment to our national security.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have people deployed overseas from every arm of the services. From the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
               Air Force
              </a>
              there are pilots, engineers, refuellers, logisticians, communicators—the full panoply of trades that are required for an aircraft to fly in a battle situation. These are very important tasks. It is not only the role of our front-line pilots who may be flying over Iraq; it is the role of all those who support our operations overseas, in this case in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
               Middle East
              </a>
              . We have heard about the Navy in the Gulf. The
              <i>

              </i>
              is currently there and is soon to be replaced by the

              <i>
               .
              </i>
              But we do not hear nearly enough about those sailors involved in border protection work, those sailors off the northern Australian coast sailing patrol boats who are working with others in the Border Force—previously in Customs vessels—to prevent people wanting to come to this country by sea from coming here. However, I do not believe we understand or really appreciate the dreadful nature of some of this work. We can debate, as we do in this place, the merits or otherwise of people being stopped by our vessels, but it is these sailors, both men and women, who have and have had the responsibility of retrieving bodies out of the water and of looking after men, women and children in desperate situations. They are doing this on our behalf, and I do not believe we give them enough acknowledgement.
             </p>
             <p>
              We see the work which is being done in the Middle East—and thank God it is being done! We acknowledge the work of our special forces in Iraq. We understand the nature of the Air Force's role in the Middle East. We see the role of our trainers in Afghanistan. We know how important these elements are. We know how important it is that we support them in that work. But I want to mention specifically and especially these people working off our northern coastline on patrol boats. I want to say this to them: although at last in the previous parliament you got medallic recognition for your operations, the fact is you carry out a vital service for this country and I do not believe we give you enough credit for what you do.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know that a lot is being said about the need to make sure that, when soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen leave the service, they are properly cared for and looked after; we now have on-base advisory services from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
               Department of Veterans' Affairs
              </a>
              trying to address some of the transition issues. But we still do not acknowledge enough the families of those who are working in the Defence Force or the strain that it places on partners and on children to have their partner or parent deployed for six or nine weeks at a time, off the northern coast, uncertain of when they are coming home, and then to see them go off again very quickly. The men and women who look after the interests of our serving men and women are very brave Australians. They deserve our proper recognition, just as those who are in uniform do. I want to thank them, as I do the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, for the magnificent job that they do securing Australia.

              </small>
              <p>
               I thank the Member for Solomon for moving this motion in support of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Defence Force
               </a>
               personnel serving overseas. I know that her electorate is home to a significant number of serving ADF personnel and their families based in Darwin. I know that she has a genuine interest and concern for their ongoing welfare. I join with the comments from the member for Lingiari and the acknowledgement that he has paid to many of our serving personnel.
              </p>
              <p>
               Similarly, my electorate of Ryan is home to about 7,000 defence personnel—one of the largest Defence Force populations of any electorate in Australia. The reason for this is that Ryan is home to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
                Gallipoli Barracks
               </a>
               at Enoggera, where many of these personnel are stationed, and neighbour to Amberley air base, in the adjacent seat of Blair. Having an active Defence Force base in my electorate means that I have the honour of attending many formal occasions at the base. Tradition and ceremony are important to the ADF, and few ceremonies are more poignant than the farewells to ADF personnel as they depart on active missions overseas.
              </p>
              <p>
               On two occasions this year I have had the honour of participating in ceremonies to farewell troops about to be deployed overseas. It is a strange mix of emotion—excitement and solemnity from the troops; pride and apprehension from their families. Above all else, I am always struck by the outstanding professionalism and quality of Australian Defence Force personnel. We should always remember the service they provide to our nation in protecting our freedoms and advancing our interests overseas.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the time the Member for Solomon submitted this motion, more than 2,000 ADF personnel were serving abroad. In the consideration in detail of the defence portfolio, the Minister advised me that that number now stands at more than 2,500. Several hundred of those are from 7 Brigade, based at Gallipoli Barracks. Around 300 ADF personnel are currently at
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Taji" rel="nofollow">
                Camp Taji
               </a>
               , in Iraq, as part of Operation OKRA. Taji is a major defence base, and Australian forces are working with our
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                New Zealand
               </a>
               counterparts to train the Iraqi army. This is an important job, as the Iraqi army is at the front line of global efforts to contain and defeat ISIL—or Daesh—who currently occupy parts of Iraq and Syria. We need to do all we can to ensure that Iraqi forces have the knowledge and training they need to get the job done. In addition to forces stationed at Taji,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hornet" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Hornet
               </a>
               fighter aircraft are flying out of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
                United Arab Emirates
               </a>
               in support of the mission. A further 170 special forces and related forces are on the ground at the international airport compound at Baghdad and have been there since September last year. They have been doing the very important job of training Iraqi counter-terrorism special forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               Aside from Operation OKRA, a further 1,000 Australian personnel are supporting Operation HIGHROAD in Afghanistan and Operation ACCORDION in the broader
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
                Middle East
               </a>
               region. A further 300 are involved in Operation MANITOU, tasked with promoting maritime security and stability in the Middle East region. Outside of the Middle East, several hundred ADF personnel are participating in Operation RESOLUTE, to keep our maritime borders secure in our region.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even after the initial headlines fade, Australian Defence Force personnel keep working until the job is done. For example, a total of 34,000 personnel rotated through Afghanistan during Australia's decade-long engagement in that nation. In fact, our engagement in Afghanistan is the longest military involvement by Australian personnel in the history of our nation. While we acknowledge the service of our Defence Force personnel as they depart to advance our interests in conflicts overseas, we must also remember the families they leave behind. Coming from a family with strong links to the Defence Force, I know that it can be difficult when loved ones are deployed overseas. As Australians we should acknowledge the sacrifice of the families of Defence Force personnel, just as we do for the troops themselves.
