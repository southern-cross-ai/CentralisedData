       <p>
        This year, 2014, marks the centenary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        . The Australian Red Cross was established at a momentous time in the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        on 13 August 1914, just nine days after the start of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, wife of Australia's sixth Governor-General, whose drive and determination was responsible for the formation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
         ARC
        </a>
        . By all accounts, Lady Ferguson was a dynamic and inspirational leader. In fact, she wrote to the mayor of every shire and municipality in Australia encouraging formation of a local branch of the fledgling ARC. Her letters were published in local papers across the country calling for public meetings, and it worked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within four months, hundreds of branches were formed across the country, including a branch in Ipswich in my electorate. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers, mostly women, volunteered for the ARC during World War I. Between August 1914 and the signing of the armistice, the Australian Red Cross dispatched nearly 396,000 food parcels and around 40,000 clothing parcels—a tremendous effort.
       </p>
       <p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the ARC had become the largest charitable organisation in Australia and it was estimated that nearly half a million of Australia's seven million population volunteered for the ARC during the war. Following
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        , the ARC focused on social welfare, national emergencies, natural disasters, the blood bank and first aid programs—all sustained by an extensive branch network and thousands of volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Australians face natural disaster or tragedy, they know that the Red Cross will be at their side. We remember their efforts following the Bali bombings. Every Australian community has its own story of when the Red Cross came to help. For some communities it is a drought or a terrible bushfire. For my community, it was the floods of early 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ARC began their assistance on 27 December 2010 when the first evacuation centre was opened. I witnessed firsthand the wonderful work, care and professionalism of the Red Cross workers in flood evacuation and recovery centres across my electorate in South-East Queensland. Red Cross assisted some 14,600 people in these centres as flooding peaked across Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the year that followed, the Red Cross had more than 1,400 staff and trained volunteers working in flood-affected communities. In fact, so trusted was the ARC that they led the committee established by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        known as the Queensland Premier's relief committee chaired by Australian Red Cross Blood Service Chair, Dr David Hamill, the former Queensland Treasurer and member for Ipswich.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ARC has played a vital role in the recovery of my community. It continues to play an active daily role in the electorate of Blair with branches in Ipswich, Toogoolawah, and Red Cross charity shops in Ipswich, Toogoolawah and Kilcoy which support the everyday work of the Red Cross, including the Trauma Teddies, which are being handed out by volunteers and donated to any child or adult suffering, trauma, illness or chronic disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        They do tremendous work through the Homelessness Early Intervention Service based in Ipswich, the Red Cross Bridges program in Esk in the Somerset region, and helping people all over the place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, a cloud has been cast over the celebrations of the Red Cross's centenary year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         The Red Cross
        </a>
        was tremendously disappointed to learn that the government would not provide the $5 million general purpose grant this year. This grant has been provided by governments, both Coalition and Labor, since 2006. This loss of this funding will have a significant impact on the Red Cross which has indicated that it will need to make budget savings that will have an impact on services, programs, staff, volunteers and support functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Red Cross is also dealing with the impact of other federal budget cuts by the Abbott government which will cause some of its programs to cease on 30 June this year with uncertainty of funding for ongoing programs. I encourage the government to restore this grant to the Red Cross. Through 100 years, the Australian Red Cross through word and action, has remained steadfastly dedicated to its motto, and I urge the government to change their current budget decision. The Red Cross motto is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To be a leading humanitarian organisation in Australia, improving the lives of vulnerable people through services delivered and promotion of humanitarian laws and values.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Red Cross has helped shape 100 years of Australia's social history. I congratulate the Red Cross on their centenary and I encourage local residents in Ipswich and the Somerset region to become a part of this year's celebration of Red Cross in Australia. I urge the government to reconsider their unnecessary, unwise and unjust budget cut of $5 million to the Red Cross.
