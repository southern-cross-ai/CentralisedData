        I want to make the parliament aware of a particular issue that I think is very unfair. As you know, the government, under health minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butler" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , introduced funding for continuous blood glucose monitoring technology for people over the age of 21 with diabetes. This is a very important way of making sure people keep their blood sugars under control. It reduces the side effects from diabetes and reduces hospitalisation, and saves the health system a lot of money. It has been great for adults as well as children to use this technology. However, there is a small group of people with diabetes for whom that funding has been denied once they turn 21—that is, people with cystic fibrosis related diabetes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cystic fibrosis causes a number of problems, but in particular it causes pancreatic damage from the build-up of very sticky secretions. This destroys the islet cells, where insulin is produced. It's exactly the same defect in cystic fibrosis related diabetes as in type 1 diabetes—that is, lack of insulin. It's not type 2 diabetes, where there is insulin resistance; this is damage to the pancreas so you cannot produce insulin. It is exactly the same defect. But the department of health classifies this not as type 1 diabetes but as diabetes related to cystic fibrosis. Therefore, even though they have the same defect as others with type 1 diabetes, these people are being denied funding for continuous blood glucose monitoring.
       </p>

        It really is a bureaucratic, ridiculous defect in our system, and it should be changed. It's a very small number of people. It includes people who, because of their cystic fibrosis, often have chronic lung disease and may have even, as adults, had a lung or heart-lung transplant. They have huge costs for medicines and things, but, because of this one definitional, bureaucratic, ridiculous defect, they are being denied funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on the parliament in a bipartisan way—because the same issue was there in the last parliament, under the Liberal-National government, where these people were denied this funding. I think it is a minor issue, and it is something that could be changed with the stroke of a pen. It would enable people with cystic fibrosis and diabetes to get on with their lives and have much better blood glucose control, less hospitalisation and better health overall.
