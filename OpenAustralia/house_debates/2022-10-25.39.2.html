        The Prime Minister's reference to Labor's economic illiteracy shouldn't pass anyone's mind today, and I'm sure we'll be reminded of that tonight. I refer to the decision taken by the Labor government on a Jewish holy day to stop recognising Israel's capital of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem" rel="nofollow">
         West Jerusalem

        , a decision which deeply offended our closest ally in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        and the Jewish community in Australia but which was praised by two violent terrorist groups. Has the Prime Minister spoken to or communicated with the

         Australia was among the first countries to formally recognise Israel, under Prime Minister Ben Chifley, and it occurred when

We have reaffirmed Australia's previous, longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved as part of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people.

             ; the same position that they sat there, up until 2018, and held. And what happened in 2018 was there was a by-election held in the electorate of Wentworth, and they said that they would change what had been a bipartisan position since the creation of Israel in 1948. They said that, but, once they got through the election, they didn't follow it through. They didn’t move the Australian embassy from

              Middle East
             </a>
             to secure peace is substance, not gestures. We need peace in the Middle East to be based upon a two-state solution, which recognises the right of Israel to exist in secure borders and also recognises the rights of the Palestinian people. My government will not waiver in our support of Israel or of the Jewish community in Australia. We're also unwavering supporters of the rights of the Palestinian people. What we need is a solution to the Middle East, not playing domestic politics during a by-election in order to secure a so-called advantage.
