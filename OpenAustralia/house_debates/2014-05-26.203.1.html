        I rise to acknowledge

        . In doing so, I would like to put on record my profound commitment to seeing that we remember all those children who were taken from their families. In doing so, I would also like to reflect upon the apology that was given by Prime Minister Rudd in 2008. I think that was one of the highlights of this parliament, where members all joined together to express their sorrow for what had happened in the past. Like many members in this House, I have family members who were affected by the stolen generation, and I think that as a parliament we must never forget the hurt and distress it caused to many people and the impact that it had on their lives. In 2000, I walked across the bridge along with 300,000 other Australians on the People's Walk for Reconciliation, when we all joined together to express our support for those people that had been taken from their families. On National Sorry Day, it is so important for each and every one of us to remember and to reflect on this disaster in our history.
