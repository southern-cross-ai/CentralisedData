        Today, I rise to speak about the Rudd government’s community infrastructure program. I am delighted to record that the Enfield Olympic Swimming Pool in my electorate of Lowe will receive $190,000 to upgrade its amenities under the community infrastructure program. Those funds are part of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and

        , the Hon.

        ’s, $250 million component of the program, allocating a share to every local council and shire in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Enfield swimming pool is Sydney’s oldest freshwater swimming pool and it celebrated its 75th birthday in November last year.

        recently funded the construction of an indoor heated pool, and the new change rooms, to be funded by the federal government, will make the entire facility an all-round water wonderland for the residents in my electorate of Lowe. The pool hosts many children’s swimming lessons, aquarobic classes and swimming clubs. The upgrade to the change rooms will be warmly welcomed by the patrons of this fabulous facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community infrastructure program was initially announced by the Prime Minister on 18 November last year. The program gave every council and shire the opportunity to submit projects for the benefit of their community. It is terrific that the submissions to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        are processed so quickly so that the fantastic improvements to our local communities can be delivered as soon as possible. I am also very pleased to note that, despite the best efforts of the Liberal and National parties to prevent the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan passing through the parliament, an additional $500 million for community infrastructure projects will be made available to local councils this year. That brings the total funding available for community infrastructure to $800 million. Minister Albanese highlights that this is the single largest investment in local infrastructure in Australia’s history.
       </p>
       <p>
        This initiative will result in the improvement of sports grounds, community centres, swimming pools, town halls and many more worthwhile projects in every electorate in Australia. Without federal funding assistance, I know that many of these projects would not be possible. The program is important to our local community because it stimulates the economy, supports local jobs and invests in quality long-term infrastructure which will be utilised and enjoyed by generations to come. I take this opportunity to congratulate Burwood Council on their application for this funding and note the good work of the mayor, Councillor Lesley Furneaux-Cook, who is continuing to work hard for her municipality, following in the steps of former mayor, Councillor John Faker. Burwood Council will receive the approval for the funding shortly, and I encouraged them to organise the relevant paperwork as quickly as they can to ensure the construction work can be underway as soon as practicable. In my more than 10 years as federal member for Lowe, I have made many representations to Canberra supporting local projects like this and today I am pleased that the Rudd government is delivering for my electorate. I commend the Prime Minister,

        , and Minister Anthony Albanese for this worthy initiative, and I look forward to further funding announcements for other councils in my electorate of Lowe.
