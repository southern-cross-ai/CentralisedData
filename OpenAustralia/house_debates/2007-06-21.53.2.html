        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a redevelopment of Robertson Barracks, the home of the Army’s 1st Brigade, a brigade that is almost as good as 3rd Brigade in Townsville. The works now proposed are required to meet the requirements of the

The works consist primarily of extension or replication of existing facilities. The estimated turn-out cost of the proposal is $72.1 million, plus

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to refurbish 43 staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Tokyo, Japan. The Australian government built the existing embassy complex and has occupied it since 1990. The complex comprises the chancery, apartments and recreational facilities. The proposal is to undertake internal refurbishment of all 43 staff apartments. The works will include upgrading building services and will ensure compliance with current standards and building codes and enhanced amenity for tenants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government owns the embassy complex, which was valued at $258.25 million in 2006. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $22 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2008 with completion in 2010.
