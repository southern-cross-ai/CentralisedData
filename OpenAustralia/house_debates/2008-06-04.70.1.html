Minister, when will you release a full electorate by electorate breakdown of your party’s election promise of 105 better region projects?

            I am very pleased to get a question, the first question, indeed, in this parliament, from the shadow minister for regional development. I am particularly pleased to get a question about the Sustainable Regions Program. In this House we have had some debate about Regional Partnerships. Many of the members here, even those in regional areas, would not be aware that the previous government had a Sustainable Regions Program. The Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Australia
            </a>
            and I had a meeting with the new Regional Development Australia board, made up of the chairs of the executive of the old area consultative committees here in this parliament. It was a pretty interesting meeting because we discussed the Sustainable Regions Program. There were a number of sustainable regions. One of those was the

             North Coast of New South Wales

            I asked the former chair of the area consultative committees, ‘What electorates were in the North Coast region of New South Wales?’ We all know the North Coast begins at the Queensland border. You cross the Tweed and you hit the electorate of Richmond. But was Richmond included in the Sustainable Region for the North Coast of New South Wales? No! Why? Because after the 2004 election, when Labor won the electorate of Richmond with our outstanding candidate Justine Elliott, they excised it from the North Coast of New South Wales. The North Coast Sustainable Region consisted of Lyne, Cowper and Page but it excluded Richmond. Do not let me think that it was just discrimination against people who happen to vote Labor, because the honourable member’s question goes to the Darling Matilda Way region. The Darling Matilda Way begins at the Victorian border and goes—

               The Darling Matilda Way Sustainable Region area begins down around Balranald and the Wentworth local government area. It goes all the way up through Bourke and Brewarrina, which is where this particular project is included. It goes up into Queensland; it has got Diamantina and Barcoo and goes right up to Winton, Longreach, Aramac and Jericho, which, before the election, were of course all held by the National Party exclusively.

                   Order! The member for Calare will resume his seat. As I said, the construct of the question went to concluding about an electorate-by-electorate breakdown of 105 Better Regions projects, or something. The minister has the call.

                    The Sustainable Region for Darling Matilda Way stops, though. It does not include

                    But let us go further and look at a third sustainable region, the Campbelltown Sustainable Region. You know: remote and rural Campbelltown, represented from Mosman. We had two areas—Camden and Campbelltown; not Liverpool around it; not Wollondilly, which is far more regional than either of them; not Wollongong, which is a regional centre—just Camden and Campbelltown. I wonder why? I wonder why you would single out Camden and Campbelltown to make into a sustainable region. What an outrage.

                    The only thing that makes the Regional Partnerships program just look red hot, rather than totally on fire, is the Sustainable Regions program. What an outrage. This mob opposite define ‘regional Australia’ by how people vote and not by where it was actually located. It was all about politics and not about geography.
