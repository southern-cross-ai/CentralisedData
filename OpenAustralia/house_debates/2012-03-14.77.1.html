        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Police Force today that 140 ammunition clips for hand guns had been imported into New South Wales and that 160 to 220 illegal hand guns remain in the community. Can the Prime Minister confirm that while New South Wales police began their investigation in December last year,

        <p>
         On the question of illegal firearms, I addressed in my earlier answer that there is more than one source of illegal firearms and that there is a substantial problem with the grey market in firearms that have been in Australia for some time and have moved from being in legal circulation to now being in illegal circulation. That is of concern. Clearly, if there is any importation of illegal firearms or ammunition for firearms, that is of concern too.
        </p>
        <p>
         On collaboration between state and federal governments, we want to take a partnership approach with the state government. On collaboration between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Police Force and federal government agencies, I am happy to make specific inquiries following the member's question but as a general proposition there is very good liaison between state policing services and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         . That has been my experience; I am sure it has been the experience of members generally when they have seen police forces go about their work.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the member who is clearly concerned about this matter, I assure him I do not see any politics in this. I see a general sense of concern in the community about illegal firearms. I see police concerned about the question and around the nation I see governments who are prepared to work together on this issue and work together in a collaborative way. I have indicated that to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of New South Wales
         </a>
         . I know the relevant minister has been indicating that to his ministerial colleagues as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, illegal weaponry is a difficult problem. Our society can probably pride itself that we do not have some of the dimensions of illegal gun problems that countries overseas have. The Howard government was to be commended on its gun legislation but we are always—

          On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I raise the issue of direct relevance. The Prime Minister was asked whether she was aware of a particular fact and that was whether the

           The member for Cook will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question. I think she said that she was going to make inquiries for the honourable member. The Prime Minister will be directly relevant.

           <p>
            My point was simply that these matters have been dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I hope that is going to continue, but, given the performance of the member for Cook in parliament today, I doubt it very much.
