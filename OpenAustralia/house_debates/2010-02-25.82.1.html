       <p>
        Last month I was pleased to join in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        celebrations throughout Brisbane’s southside. There is no greater honour in this job than to be present as New Australians make their pledge acknowledging the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. This Australia Day I presided over more than 300 citizenship commitments. I want to thank the Kuraby Lions, the Moorooka Lions and Archerfield Rotary for their wonderful efforts in coordinating the Moreton citizenship ceremonies and also acknowledge my own club Macgregor Lions for their very successful ceremony held in the soon to be opened Clem7 tunnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also took the opportunity to recognise local community heroes through the Moreton Australia Day awards. I want to mention each and every one of them because they are the people who give so much of their time and energy to help make Brisbane’s southside great. They are: Robin Blackson from Yeronga Op Shop; Sacha Pace,

        I do want to make special mention of Liane and Glen Woodcroft, the winners of the Sir James Killen Award for Outstanding Community Service. Liane and Glen are the kind of people you want living in your neighbourhood. They have lived in Moorooka for more than 50 years, and together help and support those who are less fortunate. Through St Vincent de Paul they regularly distribute food parcels and vouchers and also repair and donate bikes to needy children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lady Benise Killen was kind enough to turn up on the day and help present the awards in honour of her late husband and the former Liberal member for Moreton, Sir James Killen. He was a member who was well loved throughout the electorate. Finally, I would also like to thank the organisers for the day, Councillor Steve Griffiths, the ward councillor for Moorooka, and the Moorooka Lions Club, which put on a great barbecue and ceremony. There was also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Finn" rel="nofollow">

        , the member for Yeerongpilly. They organised a great Australia Day celebration at Pegg’s Park in Moorooka. I look forward to the same calibre of volunteers coming out of the woodwork for next year.

         I want to commend the member on his ability to get all that on the record. In accordance with standing order 193, the time for members’ constituency statements has expired.
