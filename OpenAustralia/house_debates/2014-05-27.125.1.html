        One of the joys of being the member for Reid, and I say this in all sincerity, is that 18 months ago I had a job and now for a short period of time, as I serve with pleasure the people of Reid, I do not have one anymore. But I have a unique chance to make a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following on in my area, the area that has been home to three generations of my family, and knowing that we are temporary custodians of our communities for our children, I cannot help but look at the generation before me through wonderful institutions like Rotary and others that give us a road map to a time when people found a way to volunteer and give back to the local community. In the short time I have in this place—more importantly, away from this place, back in my electorate—I hope I can work with institutions like Rotary to develop a road map to reinvigorate them with the youth of today, because they are just an amazing institution. It is not just them. It is institutions like them. One generation ago, whether it was because we did not have smart phones, whether it was because life was simpler, whether it was because we did not have to have two incomes to pay the mortgage—I do not know the reasons—people found ways to find the road map to give back.

        I had the honour in the period that we were away from this place of being made an honorary member of Drummoyne Rotary. I have five amazing Rotaries in my electorate of Reid: Drummoyne,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dock" rel="nofollow">
         Five Dock
        </a>
        —who fight each other tooth and nail over who can be better—Concord, Strathfield and Auburn-Lidcombe. Drummoyne paid me the ultimate honour of asking me to become an honorary member. I did that in the time we were away. I have just received a text, in sending a text to a friend of mine to ask who it was that nominated me, from Michael Megna: 'Five Dock's changeover was last Friday night and I could not be there. But at that dinner they have asked me to be an honorary Rotary member, too.' Apparently that is in the by-laws—you can do that.

        An honourable member: You will get fined.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will get fined; you are right, Melissa. During the week just gone I also attended the Youth Achievement Awards with Strathfield Rotary, giving back to the area, acknowledging the youth of the future and developing a road map for them to become the Rotary members of tomorrow. My challenge to the people of Reid, and it is one that I will take into battle day in and day out in the short period of time I have the honour of representing them, is to engage with institutions like Rotary, to all of those at Drummoyne, Five Dock, Concord, Strathfield and Auburn-Lidcombe. Thank you for all you do for our wonderful community. Long may you continue to do so. May your ranks be filled with the enthusiasm that comes with youth.
