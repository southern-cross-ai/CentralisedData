       <p class="italic">
        That this House:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Tasmanian Government
        </a>
        so Tasmania can play its role in the defence research and manufacturing industries sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to note there are no government speakers for this motion, and that would be because there are not any coalition members representing the state of Tasmania in the House, which is understandable. But I know I am adequately backed up by my Labor colleagues for Tasmania in the member for Bass and the member for Lyons, and I thank them for their contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion I put forward today is exactly the same motion that went through the Senate some weeks ago, which came out of a bipartisan arrangement with the coalition. In turn, that arrangement came out of a meeting the Tasmanian MPs and senators had with the University of Tasmania and the Australian Maritime College, to look at Tasmania's defence capabilities and how we can promote those better.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to thank Labor's Senator Carol Brown, who worked very closely with the Liberal Senate members, and probably more so with Senator Duniam and Senator Bushby, whom I would like to thank for their contribution to this motion. This motion went through the Senate with bipartisan support. I think that is really important when we are talking about something so important for the state of Tasmania. This is something that, if Defence looked at investing more money in defence materiel in Tasmania, would create a lot of jobs and grow the Tasmanian economy. It was quite pleasing that that motion received bipartisan support from the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. This motion has also received support from the Minister for Defence Materiel and the shadow minister for defence, so it is clearly a very bipartisan motion, which is fantastic for our state.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we had this meeting with the AMC and the university, there was a genuine view that we needed to promote Tasmania's manufacturing industries and research capabilities for Tasmania to participate in the defence sector. My colleague the member for Bass will speak more about the Australian Maritime College, but I want to use my time to talk about what has been done previously by Labor, and then speak about my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        In southern Tasmania, there exist a large number of industries with defence capability, predominantly in and around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Prince of Wales Bay
        </a>
        on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwent_River" rel="nofollow">
         Derwent River
        </a>
        . These include Incat, who sold catamarans to the United States navy; Taylor Bros, who are specialists in marine accommodation and who have been awarded a contract for the supply and installation of these products for the new air warfare destroyers; specialist antenna suppliers Moonraker Australia, who have been awarded a contract for these new vessels; and Liferaft Systems Australia, who design and manufacture marine evacuation systems and life rafts. I would like to congratulate Senator Carol Brown and the former Labor candidate for Denison,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austin" rel="nofollow">
         Jane Austin
        </a>
        , who had previously secured a commitment from this side of the House for Prince of Wales Bay to be declared a defence precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate in the north-west of Tasmania, we are very fortunate to have a number of manufacturers and fabricators who have the capability to participate in the defence industry. This was evidenced through the Department of Defence Land 400 bid with local manufacturer Elphinstone Group, who partnered with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbit_Systems" rel="nofollow">
         Elbit Systems
        </a>
        to construct new combat reconnaissance vehicles. The Team Sentinel bid, as it was known, brought together local, interstate and overseas expertise. Team Sentinel also signed on with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Deakin University
        </a>
        to develop a mobile target system for its Land 400 vehicle, which further demonstrates the collaboration that can take place between tertiary institutions and local manufacturers. While the Team Sentinel bid was not down-selected to the next stage, it did demonstrate the capability that does exist in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
         In April
        </a>
        , I was pleased to host a visit to my electorate by the shadow minister for defence. The shadow minister reaffirmed Labor's support for Tasmania playing a role in Australia's defence capability, and he was able to inspect three local manufacturers. The first one was Elphinstone. As mentioned, Elphinstone was a partner in the Team Sentinel bid. It is an industry leader in the design, manufacture and support of quality equipment for the global underground, surface mining and rail maintenance industries. Elphinstone also enjoys a close relationship with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTAS" rel="nofollow">
         UTAS
        </a>
        and the AMC. Last year, employers from Elphinstone were upskilled in a project delivered by Productivity Improvers, with the AMC being the registered training organisation. Elphinstone has been the driving force behind the establishment of a simulated work environment, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , that is located at the Tasmanian Manufacturing Centre of Excellence in Burnie.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second place we visited was Penguin Composites, which has separate facilities for recreational vehicle assembly, metal workshops and fibreglassing. Some of the projects that have been completed by Penguin Composites include building igloos for Antarctica, and, more recently, working with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
         AMSA

        on the construction of lighthouses.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Edge" rel="nofollow">
         Direct Edge
        </a>
        in Burnie produces computerised sheet metal for manufacturing product, which is sold directly and indirectly throughout the world. So we certainly have the capability in Tasmania. I am pleased that this has received bipartisan support in the Senate, and I thank those speakers who will be speaking on this today.

         <p>
          I second the motion. I am very pleased to rise in this chamber to support this motion moved by my good friend the member for Braddon. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_College" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Maritime College
          </a>
          is Australia's peak maritime research and training organisation. It is primarily based within my electorate of Bass, although it has other facilities at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_Point" rel="nofollow">
           Beauty Point
          </a>
          within the electorate of Lyons.
         </p>
         <p>
          Members will be aware that, in the 2016 federal election, both parties supported the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
           University of Tasmania
          </a>
          's transformation project with the effect of facilitating the move of the northern campuses of the University of Tasmania at Burnie and Newnham. The move of the campus in Launceston from Newnham to Inveresk will transform the potential for thousands of Tasmanian students to undertake further education, driving greater educational attainment through more students undertaking trades and higher education, including associate degrees. The relocation of the Launceston campus to Inveresk creates significant potential for innovative uses of the old campus. That is enhanced by the fact that the Australian Maritime College will remain at Newnham.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian Maritime College has a proud history of working with industry across the many disciplines it leads, both in research and in training. It undertakes significant research with respect to renewable energy, including facilitating design and testing of both wave and tidal power generation.
         </p>
         <p>
          At a recent visit to the Australian Maritime College with shadow assistant minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Conroy" rel="nofollow">
           Pat Conroy
          </a>
          , the member for Shortland, we inspected the Australian Maritime College's extensive cavitation testing facility. This facility is world leading. Its expertise already has defence potential, given that it has undertaken testing for Australian defence projects but also for, amongst others, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" rel="nofollow">
           United States Navy
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          It has particular expertise in the design of unmanned robotic vehicles, otherwise known as autonomous underwater vehicles. These vehicles are already a key tool in underwater exploration. There are obvious applications in defence, given that such vehicles are not subject to the limitations associated with the carriage of crew. Remote sensing is already a particular expertise developed by the University of Tasmania, particularly in agriculture. This research capability and the Maritime College's close connection with industry can facilitate the development of an industry hub in Launceston, particularly in the fabrication of these vehicles.
         </p>
         <p>
          Launceston has access to Australia's fastest broadband internet. Developments in manufacturing, including the use of 3D printing, assume that a design, even a complex design, can be transmitted to a 3D printer for manufacture. Engineering and architecture, indeed any process which utilises
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD" rel="nofollow">
           CAD
          </a>
          software, are significantly enhanced by access to gigabit internet. Currently there is no better place in Australia to leverage the investment in fibre internet and access to world-beating research, development and training than in Launceston, Tasmania.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know that there is still a future for manufacturing in Australia, providing that manufacturers identify an area where expertise and skills are overriding considerations, rather than high-volume production. We also know that investment in defence contracting fulfils the object of supporting advanced manufacturing. There are many components required in complex systems, whether what is being manufactured is a submarine, a surface vessel or a land based vehicle.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government has spoken on many occasions about the potential for businesses within Australia to participate in the significant investments required to deliver these projects. I have previously spoken in this place about the necessity for training, in particular trades training, associated with shipbuilding in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          . The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC" rel="nofollow">
           AMC
          </a>
          should play a key role in the establishment of any maritime technical college in South Australia. The AMC is not just a research institution. It is not just an institution of higher learning. It has a proud history in training for trades including those associated with shipping and defence. Clearly, investment in advanced manufacture will be enhanced by close proximity to an institution like the AMC. This will particularly be the case given that vocational training, associate degrees and higher degrees including engineering are available within close proximity to the Newnham campus.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are already success stories in advanced manufacturing within my electorate of Bass and also within Northern Tasmania. I have previously spoken about the expertise which is being developed with respect to remote sensing. The Sense-T project focused on remote sensing. It also led, quite remarkably, to establishment within Launceston of a specialised advanced manufacturing business, which is Definium Technologies. This business manufactures circuit boards of its own design and on a contract basis. It has particular expertise in the manufacture of sensors and control systems. It is also at the forefront of developing long-range, low-power wireless network applications. There is so much potential within Northern Tasmania which can be realised by further investment, as sought by this motion.

          <p>
           I think it says something that three Labor MPs from Tasmania are united in supporting this motion moved by my friend the member for Braddon and seconded by the member for Bass and that an identical motion has passed the Senate with bipartisan support. Tasmania stands united, no matter your politics, when it comes to getting a fairer deal on defence training and manufacturing opportunities. Tasmania has led the way with marine training and research for many years, with students relocating to our island state to develop skills and get the training that gets them jobs at sea. The expertise involved in training people for a life at sea is directly relevant to the motion before the Chamber.

           Associate Professor Irene Penesis says Tasmania is:

           The Australian Maritime College at the University of Tasmania has the largest collection of marine renewable energy researchers in the country.

           continue to grow. AMC delivers the kind of training that you cannot find anywhere else in the world. It is innovative, flexible and diversity in its training models. Recently, the French team that has Australia's $50 billion submarine construction contract has signed up to use AMC's training expertise. My colleague the member for Braddon has brought this motion to the House, seeking bipartisan support from the House—we already have it from the Senate—to continue placing Tasmania at the front and centre of planning and development for defence investment.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important to remind members from the mainland that Tasmania has an important role to play in both defence training and manufacturing. I was delighted to hear the member for Braddon earlier, saying that in the Senate this motion had the support of the Minister the Defence Materiel and the shadow minister for defence. That is just fantastic news. Obviously, the message is getting to where it needs to go. From where I sit, the spirit of bipartisanship notwithstanding, it looks like WA and SA do more than all right from defence investment, and we would like to see a little more come to Tasmania.
          </p>

           A future that includes defence manufacturing is important for Tasmania in terms of secure, well-paid and highly-skilled work. But it is of equal benefit to the nation. It makes sense to place critical manufacturing assets required for defence as far as possible from potential threats. Unless we are expecting an invasion of

           s from Antarctica or—to paraphrase Liberal Senator Eric Abetz, 'militarised penguins'—Tasmania is as secure as it comes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Tasmanians also have the capacity, the drive, the skills and the passion to manufacture maritime defence assets that are world standard. We already do that. In addition to the sought-after civilian ferries, Incat, in the south of Tasmania, provides catamarans to the

           In my electorate, we have highly-skilled workforces at The Engineering Company in Brighton, at Elphinstone Australia at Triabunna and at Haywards at Evandale to name a few. These worksites concentrate on advanced manufacturing, producing products used all over the world—including the unforgiving terrain of the Antarctic.
          </p>
          <p>
           What this motion offers is long-term jobs generation and the building of a skilled defence manufacturing workforce, which is itself a national security asset. Siting defence manufacturing in Tasmania has a flow-over effect into the wider Tasmanian community, ensuring an influx of energy and dollars. Critically, it will have a positive effect on the employment of apprentices as well; since 2013 we have lost too many.
          </p>

           I urge members opposite to support this motion and to work with us. Thank you
