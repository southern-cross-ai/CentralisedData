        I recently held the second annual Banks Junior Short Film Festival, a competition which gives primary and secondary school students in my electorate the opportunity to showcase their filmmaking skills while talking about our great area and why we love it. It was a terrific night and I would like to acknowledge the support of the Shopfront Arts Co-op at Carlton, who cosponsored the event, as they did last year. The films were fantastic and were from a wide range of schools in our area with a diverse range of filmmaking styles.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the great things about the festival is that it allows the kids' films to be shown up on the big screen at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Beverly Hills
        </a>
        Cinema in Beverly Hills. I would like to congratulate all the category winners and the finalists on their high quality films. In particular, I would like to congratulate Vincent Vangi from Mater Dei Primary School for winning the primary individual category. He has won a film production course at Shopfront Arts Co-op, which I think he will make great use of given his obvious artistic skills. I would also like to congratulate Oatley Public School, who won the primary group categoryâ€”and particularly Liv Coxsedge, Chaila Olliffe and Abby Coxsedge for all their great work. Congratulations again to everyone involved in the festival.
