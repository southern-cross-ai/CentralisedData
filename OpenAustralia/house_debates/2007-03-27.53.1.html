        That the amendments be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        In doing so, I thank the member for Gellibrand for her earlier comments on a related bill. I do not propose to make any further comment on these amendments. My comments were covered in the previous order of the day.

         In this instance, to emphasise the point I was making on the last group of amendments, I think we have 50-plus amendments here, which Labor are happy to support, although I do note our ongoing disappointment that the government chose not to accept our amendments in relation to the quality protections and the timing of when those standards and quality assurances were going to be in place. However, we are happy to support the amendments that have been moved in the other place.
