        Bushfires are not uncommon in my community. Last weekend the residents of Campvale, Medowie and Salt Ash, which are towns in my electorate, were faced with another bushfire emergency. Within one hour of the fire starting, wind gusts reached over 100 kilometres per hour, forcing the advice level to emergency. Residents were told to implement their bushfire survival plans immediately. For 88 hours intense flames spread through over 1,900 hectares of land. That's over 207 football fields, to put it in relatable terms. When the fires were officially declared under control on Monday morning, it did feel like a miracle. But it was no miracle; this was the result of the tireless hard work of many organisations, businesses, locals and individuals who chipped in, and I recognise and thank them today.

        , who attended with his Davidson crew to join the effort. I extended my hand of thanks to him in the corridors this week, and I mean that sincerely. Thank you doesn't seem like enough to express my gratitude to all of these people. To any whom I have missed, I do apologise. My community are so grateful for your hard work. We're heading into another busy bushfire season. Please take care, but know you are really valued in our community.
