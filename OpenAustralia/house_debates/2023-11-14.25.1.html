        prior to independence. They made a wonderful contribution to Papua New Guinea and to relations there, and they keep those connections to this very day.

        Finally, the third Territorian is Daniel Bolton. He flies a Mallard, which is a seaplane, up in the Northern Territory. He's recently written a book that's illustrated by his dad, Greg. It's a fantastic book. It was great of the Prime Minister to launch it for Daniel in the parliament today.
