        I represent one of the oldest electorates in the country, and my elderly constituents do not want to be told by this government how and when to spend their pension. But there is a real possibility that the government will extend the cashless welfare card to age pensions. They have already passed legislation to do this. Let me repeat: they have already passed a law to extend the cashless welfare card to pensioners. What will this mean for my elderly constituents? They will not be able to choose where they do their grocery shopping. If they want to buy their grandchildren a present, this will be limited to shops the government decides they can buy them inâ€”much like the

        . If they like to go to a Knights or Jets game, they won't be able to. If they like to enjoy a beer or a wine at the end of the day, the government will stop this. And if, heaven forbid, they like to have a bet, they won't be allowed to under this government.

        David wrote on my Facebook page on the weekend: 'Pensioners should be able to manage their assets and not be dictated to by the government. This means they cannot buy second-hand furniture and cannot go to a club for a cheap meal. Certain places like butchers take cash. Why should government dictate to pensioners the way they live?' Pensioners have worked their whole lives and paid their taxes. They're entitled to a dignified retirement, and the government needs to rule this out. Labor will abolish the cashless welfare card and we'll continue to fight to stop this government's cruel plan.
