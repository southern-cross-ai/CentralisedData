       <p>
        The federal budget is kicking goals in Blair. Ipswich people love their sports, and I'm proud to have secured tens of millions of dollars in funding both elite and grassroots sporting facilities across the city in the budget. We want to see more locals, especially young kids, getting active and participating in sport. Ipswich is one of the fastest growing regions in the country, so it's vital to invest in our community and social infrastructure to promote healthy lifestyles. There's a huge demand for sporting facilities in our city, and the upgrades like the ones in the budget will help meet demand and support the growing popularity of many sports.

        Reserve funding is about investing in a state-of-the-art facility so we can hold elite level football games in Ipswich. Ipswich is also a sporting nursery. We want to develop the next generation of sporting champions like

        With the Olympics being held in South-East Queensland in the next decade, we want Ipswich to get a slice of the action and secure some events or have teams use Ipswich facilities for training. That's where the new Brisbane Lions Springfield stadium in the Brighton Homes Arena could play a role. I'm really excited about the $20 million committed to upgrade the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ipswich_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         North Ipswich Reserve
        </a>
        stadium. This is the first stage in developing the North Ipswich sport and entertainment precinct in a boutique 12Â½-thousand-seat stadium with broadcast facilities to ensure that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">

        and A-league matches could possibly be played in that region. I'm very disappointed in the NRL and the A-league for not supporting the Jets and the Western Pride bids for licences in this area. This will help set us up with the kind of stadium that we need. I've been championing this marquee project for several years. I know it's a real game changer for our city.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's also really important is the $2 million to expand the Ipswich basketball stadium,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
         JBS
        </a>
        Arena, at Booval. This meets the growing popularity of the sport. There has been a 50 per cent increase in participation, particularly by women and girls, in basketball in Ipswich in the last 18 months. This $2 million will provide a total of five courts for club competition purposes and four suitable for representative competitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's $1 million to upgrade facilities at Ironbark Park to support the fast-growing Ripley Valley Football Club. This will help with the construction of a canteen, kitchen, change rooms and modern amenities for the South Ripley playing fields.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm really pleased about half a million dollars to provide the Ipswich Hockey Association with much needed upgrades for the hockey grounds, including tower lighting, automatic irrigation and field reconfiguration. I think this is so important because it sends a message to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        : don't ever treat the Ipswich Hockey Association in the way they were treated in the past. I thank them for their commitment and for working with me.
