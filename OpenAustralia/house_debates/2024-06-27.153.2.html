       <p>
        I rise to make a brief contribution to a debate that is important, and I think it is also appropriate that the debate around the awful incidents of 13 April is conducted in Australia's parliament. I think all of us—those of us who are very familiar with Westfield Bondi, unlike me, and those of us who are from a different part of the country—remember where we were when news started to break and the horrific images started to be filtered out into the community. Those events haven't faded and the memory of them mustn't fade. I want to briefly join others, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, in paying my condolences to those who lost their lives and to those in mourning. I want to reflect, too, on the significance of the events more broadly and add my voice to those who have been clear in articulating that we cannot fail to remember the events and their enduring consequences. Six people were killed. Six lives were taken, and I join others in recognising the suffering of those who knew and loved Xixuan Cheng, Pikria Darchia, Ash Good, Dawn Singleton, Faraz Tahir and Jade Young. We must remember them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must also extend our deep appreciation to those confronted by almost unimaginably awful circumstances, who stood up and played their role, supporting those at risk and placing themselves at risk—those who ran towards the danger. I think, of course, about Inspector Amy Scott of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Police Force, whose heroism has been widely recognised. I think, too, of Faraz Tahir, who was amongst those six whose lives were tragically taken from them. A refugee on his first day at work, his heroism should not be forgotten. So many people showed extraordinary bravery that day, and stepped in to help others at great cost to themselves. Many were Australian citizens; some were not. It shows us that everyone in our communities are capable of and have demonstrated that they are caring for those around us. There's no assessment of visa status in circumstances like those confronted by Damien Guerot and Muhammad Taha during those events. It was my great privilege, as Minister for Immigration, to speak to both of those gentlemen, particularly Mr Taha, who was suffering in hospital at the time, and extend the appreciation of a grateful nation in what I hope is a meaningful gesture that has been acknowledged on all sides of the parliament. I think it says a lot about the country we are, that that is so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also acknowledge the contribution of the local member, the member for Wentworth, in this place and more broadly, including in her interactions with me with respect to my responsibilities and my obligations. Her contribution in the parliament was powerful and her advocacy was significant. I want to also acknowledge the Westfield and Scentre Group and their staff for their support and the ongoing assistance they've provided for many impacted individuals and those close to them including families and others. They've worked very closely with my office and the department to ensure that support is available where victims and their families need it. I acknowledge, too, the extraordinary work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         NSW Police Force
        </a>
        , who've supported victims as well, as they regularly do. They were there when the incident occurred, and they were also there while people continued to need support, and I'm sure that will continue to be the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I want to thank the women and men of my department for their support for victims and families around events, including funerals. Ensuring that people can travel and support family members makes such a difference at a time of need. In a country like ours, a nation built on migration, I like to think this is a big part of the Australian way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vale to all of those who had their lives taken.

        <p>
         The shocking events at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_Junction" rel="nofollow">
          Bondi Junction
         </a>
         have impacted many. Six lives were lost, 12 people were injured and many others were traumatised. We've heard much about the heroism of the first responders. I, too, acknowledge the extraordinary work that they did in swiftly addressing this shocking tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
         A member of my staff was related to Jade Young, one of the six people who died so senselessly at Bondi Junction. I asked Jade's family if they wanted something to be put on the record. So the bulk of my remarks will be statements from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Young" rel="nofollow">
          Elizabeth Young
         </a>
         , the mother of Jade Young; and from Toby Halligan, Jade's cousin. I also want to acknowledge Jade's father, Ivan; her brother,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ" rel="nofollow">
          PJ
         </a>
         ; her partner, Noel; her two daughters; and her many aunts, uncles, cousins and other family. This statement is from Elizabeth Young, the mother of Jade Young:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My heart is fractured and our world is shattered.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am angry I will never have those mother/daughter moments that are so simple and precious, so mundane that you forget what the last ever conversation you had with your daughter was about.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am angry that Jade's girls will grow up without the love and care of their mother.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am especially angry that my beautiful, sweet, soft hearted, hard working, loving daughter was robbed of her life. Her daughters were settling into school well, school holidays had just started with the prospect of time to spend with her girls, she was about to take over a good solid architectural practice, she had the love of a good man and great friends … and finally her longed-for puppy, Teddy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our mental health system must be fixed. We must support those who need help and do better to manage those who pose a danger to others. And we must provide better support to the victims of violent crime.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Please take action. There is no solace to be had for our family. There will be no peace. But there must be change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now I want to read some words from Toby Halligan, Jade's cousin. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Working in the Parliament is an enormous privilege. This is a place where we do our best to change this country for the better.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Working here while carrying the grief and trauma of Jade's death has felt like a crushing burden.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Grief is a private thing and there are no words to express the damage this has done to our family and our sadness.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But we have had to find words to share our grief, so that others can share the burden of taking action to ensure such an event can never happen again.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Please, help us share that burden.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I gave my personal condolences to the shoppers and the staff affected by this tragedy. Retail workers cop a lot and I know the impacts of this on the retail workers in the Westfield centre are considerable. Your loss and the impact that this has had on the Bondi Junction community and on the nation at large will not be forgotten.
