        On Saturday night, in just two sleeps, a local community sporting club in the heart of my electorate is playing in the grand final of a national competition. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Football Club
        </a>
        was established in 1859, 19 years before
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United" rel="nofollow">

        and more than a century before the

        . It's the second oldest football club of any code in the world. We won our first premiership in 1878 in the

        Across that long history there has never been a year so remarkable as this. It has been characterised by a sense of selflessness and sacrifice. Back in March, when the lockdown first happened, our coach,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Scott" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Scott
        </a>
        , volunteered not to be paid at all. The team has been on the road since 6 July, more than 100 days with long separations from their families. Our remarkable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , earlier this week, when he was named the Geelong Business Leader of the Year, said, 'I never really wanted to be recognised as the best leader but I love being the leader of the best team.'

        , Gazza—all of them—we are so proud of you. We also take inspiration from another Geelong identity, Tegan Philip, who was victorious with the Vixens last weekend. We're up against a soulless national corporate brand—for those who haven't grown up with the

        , like the Prime Minister, you can think about this as a contest between a fighting local community and, I don't know, maybe Coca-Cola. The Geelong Football Club stands for everything that is good and right in this world. On Saturday night the whole nation will be behind you. Go Cats!

         We are past 2 pm. I did allow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to go on a little longer than his 90 seconds. I couldn't have stopped him! I try to be impartial in this business, but I think the photographers have had the photos of the scarfs. I'm tempted to ask the attendants to collect all the Richmond paraphernalia and remove it from the chamber, as a loyal Carlton supporter! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for member's statements has concluded.
