        My question is for the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in the gallery are representatives of the farmers, shearers, truckies and local communities whose livelihoods rely on the live sheep export industry that the Labor government is shutting down. Given Labor claims its phase-out of live sheep exports is due to animal welfare, can the Prime Minister name one country that has higher animal welfare standards for live exports than Australia?

         I'm asked about the live sheep export industry, and I'm asked in the context of the legislation that was carried through the Senate last night. I met with farmers yesterday afternoon in my office. I listened to what they had to say and I respectfully, of course, indicated a preparedness to continue to work with them. They have an industry that's worth $80 million. The package that we have on the table is currently worth $107 million, greater than the annual industry. The truth is that the live sheep industry has been in decline compared with the sheep meat industry, which is valued at around $4 billion and which has expanded substantially in places like the United Kingdom.

          Order! The Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, I'm quite happy for you to take the conversation outside to discuss the issue in detail. The Prime Minister was asked a question, and I want to hear his answer, as I'm sure everyone in the House does.

           The Leader of the Nats might have just had a little nudge to his right, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had this to say: live sheep exports 'fails on both economic and animal welfare grounds. Unfortunately, this is an industry with an operating model built on the suffering of animals.' The industry has had 'countless second chances'.

             On relevance, it was a very tight question around naming one country, predicated on Labor's decision—not on the coalition's but on Labor's decision—to shut this industry down. It was a very tight question asking for one country. He's been given nearly two minutes, and he has not been relevant to the question, which was very tight.

              The issue with direct relevance, as we deal with this in most weeks in question time is that, if the Prime Minister wasn't talking about live sheep exports, if he wasn't talking about the government's decision and if he wasn't talking about the commentary around it, of course he wouldn't be being directly relevant. And, yes, I know you'd like a one-word answer, but, as we have done many times, the standing orders don't provide for that. There are options to provide that. No-one's taken me up on the offer to ensure that could happen. So, whilst the standing orders exist as they are and the Prime Minister is being directly relevant to the topic—and I think he's quoting another member of parliament regarding the issue—I'm left with no other choice than to make sure that he remains on topic. But if he strays off the topic—

                  Western Australia

                 The deputy opposition leader had this to say: the industry has had 'countless second chances' to improve conditions, but 'exporters do not comply with the rules' because 'regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs'. She was asked last year—last year, the same position—and she said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 … we actually don't need this trade at all. … of course I stand by what I presented in the parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Sarah Henderson said this: 'If any person in Australia crams sheep into a transport vehicle for 25 days in the searing heat, that person will be charged with animal cruelty.' Of course, there's the member for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
                  La Trobe
                 </a>
                 , another key member of their frontbench, who said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 If you had a dog in a car all day in hot conditions, the owners would be charged with animal cruelty, yet it is

                 for … a thousand sheep to go into international waters, suffer heat stress, suffer lack of ventilation, suffer lack of water and die in cruel, inhumane conditions. To me that is not acceptable.
