        , our region—the great Geelong and Corangamite regions—offers many existing manufacturing facilities which could be re-purposed for part of the manufacture, assembly and maintenance of the estimated 225 armoured fighting vehicles which will be delivered under the LAND 400 contract. With

        defence facility and existing roads and rail freight infrastructure, our region has so much to offer. We also have the advanced manufacturing skills and capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government is extremely focused on the opportunities that LAND 400 will deliver to Australian industry. Australian companies have the opportunity to play a vital role in this project, including in relation to component and parts supply; integration of Australian communications, sensor and weapons systems; engineering and testing; facilities; and vehicle sustainment and logistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the request for tender time line extended until early August, I am delighted to report that one consortium intends to place part of its operations in Geelong if it wins the LAND 400 tender. It is also focused on delivering a very high percentage of Australian industry content, which of course is a very important priority for our government. That means more jobs for local workers and more opportunities for businesses and the extended supply chain. In fact, after I speak in the chamber, I am going to be attending a meeting with the consortium, and as I do all the time, each and every day, I will be fighting for these jobs for our region, for Corangamite and for Geelong. That is why it is so critical that the state Labor government deliver an incentives package to drive these companies to Geelong—to make sure that they have every possible advantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is incredibly disappointing, in contrast to the $100 million incentive package that has been proposed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government, that we have heard absolute silence from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        on such an important project. For many months, I have been calling on state Labor: 'Do the right thing; deliver this incentives package'. It might include payroll and other tax concessions, fast-tracking of planning approvals, the provision of manufacturing infrastructure—a range of different things the state government can do. It is very, very disappointing that we have seen no action from Daniel Andrews and state Labor. All we have seen from federal MPs, such as the member for Corio, is ongoing criticism and negativity. I am fighting for these jobs. I am very proud to continue to stand up for our region.
