        I rise tonight to talk about some of the fantastic local organisations from my electorate and the work that they do to support our community. The Multicultural Communities Council of Illawarra, known to most of us in the Illawarra as the MCCI, is a non-profit charity that supports people from diverse backgrounds in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven, as well as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and surrounding regions. With nearly 200 staff and volunteers speaking over 40 languages, the MCCI delivers a range of services including aged-care services, youth development programs, stakeholder engagement, and community volunteering and training services. Popular services include a weekly multicultural social football, a beach water safety and awareness program and a weekly women led cooking circle.
       </p>
       <p>
        SCARF, a local organisation that recently merged with the MCCI, offers programs to help refugees start a new life in Australia by navigating the practical and personal challenges of settlement while building a sense of belonging. SCARF utilises friendship based support, with their programs delivered by more than 150 local volunteers who create a special dynamic of help that is offered between friends and neighbours rather than between a caseworker and a client. It delivers tailored training workshops to help build an understanding of the refugee experience and equip participants with a broad range of cultural skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the popular programs provided is a driving mentor program, which addresses barriers such as not having access to a car, a licensed driver or important information about licensing and road rules. Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of attending the Accelerate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER" rel="nofollow">
         HER
        </a>
        networking event at the Wollongong Youth Centre as a mentor. Accelerate HER is a little bit like career speed dating. Young women from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
         CALD
        </a>
        backgrounds meet with mentors from various different backgrounds and industries. While I was there, I met two amazing women, Justine and Grace. Accelerate HER supports young women from multicultural, refugee or similar backgrounds in realising their aspirations by connecting them with industry professionals. The program enables the development of networks and pathways into their chosen professions and helps empower their future ambitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_the_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Lead the Way
        </a>
        is a new youth leadership initiative in the Illawarra region that will help develop the next generation of social cohesion community champions. Lead the Way seeks to inspire and empower young women to exercise practical leadership, taking action for themselves, their families and their communities. Lead the Way is a collaboration between the Illawarra Women's Health Centre, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wollongong" rel="nofollow">
         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
         Duke of Edinburgh
        </a>
        program and the MCCI. The program combines elements from leadership and personal development and wellbeing initiatives to help young women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds build social cohesion, community resilience, youth wellbeing, and strengthen their identities. Lead the Way supports young women to make successful life transitions, pursue their dreams, form new support networks and be active members of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program follows a strengths based and youth led approach that is trauma informed and culturally sensitive. With help from the community, it promotes personal development, furthers participants' education and skills, improves physical and emotional wellbeing and creates community engagement activities. To do this, the program is designed to build on the inherent strengths of the participants, their identities and their life experiences as migrants and former refugees. By using structured activities, they prepare young people to have the confidence and practical skills they need to exercise leadership and agency. The program also helps build community connections and create strategies to help prevent the emergence of racism and violence and to help young people respond to these threats when it's needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Justine was one of the wonderful women I met during the program. She moved to Australia from the Philippines at just eight years old and now considers Australia her second home. She said: 'I was raised in an environment that only had enough, but my childhood was a happy one. It was this environment that shaped who I am today, and I am proud to be able to call myself a Filipino.' She also said: 'After hearing about all the new and interesting places we will be able to go, I became very eager and excited to join the Lead the Way program. The women running the program are very friendly and welcoming. The program makes it possible for me to talk to people who really understand and support me. Having their own real-life experiences, we can relate to each other's struggles. I am excited to work towards my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Duke of Edinburgh Award
        </a>
        , which will help me in my future careers and teach me independence and consistency.'
       </p>
       <p>
        She went on to tell me that the program makes it possible for her to talk to people who both understand and support her because of their similar shared life experiences and struggles. She explained to me, and I quote: '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lead" rel="nofollow">
         The Lead
        </a>
        the Way program has taught me many team building and leadership skills and has pushed me beyond my comfort zone. I have been able to build my confidence, meet new people who are supportive and successful, and I have been able to gain new experiences going to many different supportive communities.' When she was asked how she would describe these programs to other multicultural young women, she said that it was a wonderful opportunity to connect with people who have gone through similar difficulties and experiences. The programs have made it possible to explore new activities and pathways that she would not have been able to experience otherwise. It was those environments that eliminated the fear of trying something new by building a support network and by encouraging her to put herself out there. In the end, the experiences were a good way for her to make friends and just have fun.

        Grace is a Congolese woman who also takes part in the Lead the Way program. Grace grew up in Kenya and moved to Australia five years ago. Since arriving in Australia, she has been an active participant in the Lead the Way program and she also attended the AccelerateHER networking event. Grace discovered the program through her school and found it to be an excellent way to interact with individuals from all cultures, bringing them together and helping them understand one another. Additionally, it was an excellent curriculum with a variety of talents to give.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grace ascribed great value to the program for helping her learn leadership and communication skills, as well as assisting her in her preparation for the Duke of Edinburgh Award. It also provided several opportunities to engage in other activities, including volunteer work and supporting her education about various aspects of other cultures. When asked if she would also recommend the program to other young women, she said that she wants to advise them to participate in the program if they ever get the chance because it offers a lot of chances and a variety of talents that they might not otherwise have. Additionally, it's a good day to spend with your friends doing other things outside of school while not attending class.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am in awe of the amazing work of so many people in our community. From the services provided by organisations such as MCCI and SCARF to the AccelerateHER and Lead the Way programs, there is so much on offer to help build a stronger community in our region. One of the many great strengths of my region is its long history of migration, multiculturalism and diversity. Over the years we have seen many new migrant communities call the Illawarra home, and I love being able to represent a diverse electorate that is teeming with such a rich cultural history. My mum immigrated to the Illawarra herself after leaving Holland when she was in primary school without any English language skills. She would go on to meet my dad and start a family in Woonona.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I am so proud that organisations such as the MCCI and SCARF are at the forefront of ensuring that all of those who choose to call Australia home are welcomed and supported. Every day you can see the impact that these services have on our community in bringing us all together. I know the values that these organisations hold around equal opportunity and inclusivity are not just the core of my beliefs and those are my community but this new Labor government. Setting the standard for how Australian should treat each other and how we should welcome new communities must start from the top, and it is so great to have a government that leads with respect back on our side of the chamber. I know that I have barely scratched the surface of the incredible number of programs available in my community. Thank you to everyone who supports our community and thank you for making me so proud to call the Illawarra home.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank Francesca Lambert, a work experience student from the

         Australian National University
        </a>
        , who spent last week helping out in my parliamentary office and helped to put this speech together. It is fantastic to see more young women taking such an interest in politics and it was an absolute delight to have her as part of our team.
       </p>

        Another quick mention tonight goes to Louis and Elizabeth at the George Cross Falcons Club at Cringila in the member for Whitlam's electorate. The state member for Wollongong, Paul Scully, and I attended the club on Saturday night, where we saw an amazing show by Elvis impersonator

        . This show provided so much joy to the Maltese community in the Illawarra. The electricity in the air was palpable. They all had a fabulous time at this event. I just wanted to thank Louis and Elizabeth and their team of volunteers who worked so hard to provide services and support for our Maltese community. I thank them so much for their time and effort.
