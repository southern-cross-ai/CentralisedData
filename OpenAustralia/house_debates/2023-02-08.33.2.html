        I'm pleased to present to the House petition

        </a>
        4579. This is a petition of 804 Australians who are asking the House to make special provisions for Bangladeshi low-skilled workers to be recruited by Australian government agencies to fill skills shortages in rural Australia as agricultural workers, fruit pickers and low-skilled city professions on temporary work visas.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue goes, of course, to the labour shortage that Australia is facing, the regional shortages that we've seen across Australia. In government the coalition proposed the ag visa. This was an innovative visa attempt to show that we could bring in low-skilled workers to fill regional and rural shortages, similar to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PALM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        scheme, which the coalition created and which has been so successful for Pacific workers. The ag visa was a real policy reform that would have delivered answers and solutions to people in regional Australia, to our productive sectors that are desperate because of these labour shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition is from Australians of Bangladeshi descent who know that there are pools of workers in the South-

        region—fantastic countries, fantastic people—willing to come here and do this work and fill this labour shortage for great wages. This is an important petition for the House. The government should really look at the decision not to proceed with the ag visa. It is a vital piece of economic reform to make sure that we can get and fill and address a critical economic gap in our rural areas and our regions. This petition shows there is huge support in Australia for these visas.

        REPORT | Published: July 24, 2022 09:37:22 The Greek Parliament has approved a deal signed between Bangladesh and Greece paving the way for recruiting 4,000 agricultural workers annually, the foreign ministry said on Friday. It will also help regularise nearly 18 thousand Bangladeshis staying in the southeast European country.

        We therefore ask the House to make special provisions for Bangladeshi Low Skilled Workers to be recruited by Australian government agencies to fill the skill shortages in Rural Australia as agricultural workers, Fruit Pickers and Low skilled city professions on a temporary workers visa. This will open a huge source of Low skilled workers.
