       <p class="italic">
        (a) that Australians live by the water. Being in and around water is part of our nation's culture and our identity, but this regular exposure to water brings risks that can be fatal;

       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the water safety education Australian children receive depends on where they live and in some cases on their parents income level;

         Torres Strait Islander

        (2) calls on the Government to:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) implement the National Swimming and Water Safety Framework (the Framework) and ensure every child has access to water safety and swimming education by the time they complete primary school. Every child should be given access to instruction in swimming and water safety in accordance with the Framework;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) conduct a parliamentary inquiry to investigate why many Australian children are not receiving adequate swimming and water safety education consistent with the Australian Water Safety Strategy and what measures it can adopt to improve access to swimming and water safety education;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) establish a national water safety education fund to provide support to the states and territories, water safety organisations and communities to ensure access to swimming pools, accredited trainers and water safety education for schools in communities which lack such facilities and services; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) provide water and surf safety messages in foreign languages via tourism operators, flights, hotels, tours across Australia highlighting the importance of swimming and water safety on beaches, rivers, lakes and swimming pools.
