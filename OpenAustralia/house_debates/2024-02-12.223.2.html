       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p>
        It's total control. Controlling someone's money, controlling someone's access to the bank account, tracking someone's spending, sending abusive or threatening messages via banking transactions, forging a signature, taking out a loan in someone else's name, stopping someone from working or forcing someone to work, refusing to contribute financiallyâ€”these are all examples of financial abuse. It's a powerful, insidious and pervasive form of abuse, and that's why I'm making an effort to bring this conversation to national attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Watch defines financial abuse as 'someone using money or finances to hurt or control someone else'. It's abuse that can happen to anyone. It does not discriminate between rich or poor, between educated or uneducated, or by gender or age. In fact, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        reported in 2021 that an estimated 1.6 million women and 745,000 men have experienced partner financial abuse. Bankwest reports that one-third of Western Australians have experienced or know someone who has experienced financial abuse, four in five agree that it is a widespread problem and one in seven admit to having been perpetrators of financial abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it's more difficult to recognise than other forms of abuse. People don't talk about money in our culture. People don't see it as a form of abuse. And women have a tendency to not talk about finances in their social circles. Some people don't even realise that it's happening until it's too late. It makes it a hidden epidemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I often talk about with people in my electorate is that financial abuse is often a red flag for other forms of abuse later on. It undermines a woman's financial independence, it limits her choices, it limits her freedom and it can leave victims-survivors in debt or poverty for years. It's often why women find it hard to leave an abusive relationship. It can be an early sign that there is yet more to come: physical, emotional and psychological abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Life has moved online, and so have our financial institutions. While it brings so many benefits to us, it exposes women to another form of abuse, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions keep up. Some of the major banks have been taking up the challenge, training staff and banning perpetrators. Looking at the design of our banking products is the next step. And what about the consequences for perpetrators of financial abuse?
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue is complex. Just last week I met with the Indian crisis centre, experts in dowry abuse. As for migrant women, visas are used to control them and take their money. Imagine going to work, getting paid and not even seeing that money. With the additional threat of being told that you could have to leave the country, it results in a significant power imbalance. This is the reality for too many women in our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge the member for Aston, who will soon be seconding this motion, and the brave women who have helped campaign on this particular issue. I want to acknowledge victims-survivors, and advocates such as Rebecca Glenn at the Centre for Women's Economic Safety, members of the newly formed Economic Abuse Reference Group in WA and other groups around Australia. We need prevention but we also need solutions. We need a coordinated approach by banks, regulators, government and consumer advocates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stopping all forms of violence against women is a priority for the Albanese government, which is why we are aiming to eliminate all forms of abuse in one generation. It's a commitment that's evidenced by Labor's financial investment in women's safety across the first two budgets. Together we can empower women with the skills and strength they need. We can change thinking and raise awareness so that people will understand financial abuse and that it's simply not okay.

          <p>
           I have spoken many times in this place, as the assistant shadow minister for the prevention of family violence, about the scourge on our society and on our families in all its forms. I've spoken about the need to break the generational cycle and all the policies that are required for prevention. If we don't do thatâ€”if we don't look at a generational approachâ€”then, in the words of victim-survivors, they will eternally be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We need to put that fence there, though systems there to prevent our victims from falling.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we know, domestic abuse constitutes much more than simple physical violence. As we're aware, coercive control is where someone uses a pattern of abusive behaviour against another person. This can include nonphysical behaviours that instil uncertainty and fear of reprisal in an individual. Financial coercion is a form of coercive control that quite often goes unnoticed by friends and loved one's. It's very easily hidden away from view. The controlling partner managers the money. The reality is that financial coercion is a primary tool of domestic abusers to subjugate and disempower their victims. That is their whole intention. Without independent access to funds, victims are unable to put steps in place to escape an abusive situation, rendering themselves powerless.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the increasing push to online services, it's far easier for would-be abuses to open, drain, deny access or close accounts without raising suspicions. With that in mind, I am very pleased to see the move by many of our financial institutions to recognise the existence and pervasive impact of coercive control in the domestic abuse space and to put conditions in place to stop it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Having said that, our bank tellers and officers are not police officers, and there need to be some very strong guidelines in place to help them. I'm not stepping back from what I have said. This is very important legislation to ensure that it doesn't happen to our victims, our victim survivors and our elderly. It is not just those in the considered domestic male or female role; it is also sons, daughters and grandchildren who also can be seen to enter into this coercive control on elderly people. The Australian Banking Association industry guideline 'Preventing and responding to family domestic violence' states:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           When a bank is aware of family and domestic violence, or suspects it may be occurring, the bank will work to support the customer wherever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the guidelines that need to be given to our bank tellers, to those working in the industry, I think it's really important that we ask these three questions. What guidelines do the banks have to establish the veracity or information about an account being used for financial control? What lawful authority do the banks have to investigate and make assessments on the nature and conduct of transactions in customers' joint or accessible accounts? What processes are in place to determine the risk that may arise for a joint account holder denying access to the perpetrator? These questions need to be answered to provide that structure for those working in our banking industry. I would hate to think that a 22-year-old teller remained silent because he or she was unaware of the guidelines and processes that should, and no doubt will, be put in place for him or her. We have to do everything we can for victims, particularly when it comes to financial coercive control.

           <p>
            I'm very pleased to speak on the motion put by the member for Swan as this is an issue that I care about deeply.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_abuse" rel="nofollow">
             Financial abuse
            </a>
            takes many forms. It can be checking over the items when you come home from shopping and questioning why certain things were purchased. If done repeatedly over time it can leave a person feeling like they have to constantly justify their needs and wants, as if they are not important. It can be having to hand over your entire wage into a joint bank account and having it managed entirely by your partner, only having a certain amount of pin money doled out each week. It's the whole attitude of, 'Don't worry about it, honey; I'll take everything.' Or you can be told that you don't need to work, that you'll be taken off completely, but years later find out that you've been taken advantage of in ways that you had no idea about, such as signing mysterious documents which turn out to be legally binding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Years after a relationship like this has ended, a woman can find herself with barely any superannuation, stripped of years of work experience, deskilled and with little self-esteem left over. Financial abuse can happen over many years, sometimes without a person even realising what's going on. It wreaks havoc with one's self-esteem and confidence and is designed to keep someone under another's control.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Albanese government has invested $2.3 billion in women's safety, including more than $326 million in prevention initiatives specifically, across our first two budgets. Last year, our government, along with the states and territories, released the National Plan to End Violence Against
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
             Women and Children
            </a>
            2022-2032. This plan specifically recognises that financial abuse is a common form of domestic and family violence. It is perpetrated by intimate partners or family members and also occurs in the context of elder and carer abuse. It manifests in different ways, but generally it is a type of controlling behaviour where the perpetrator controls finances and assets to gain power and control in a relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            The safety of women and children experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence is a national priority for the Albanese government, and our governments believe women and children experiencing violence should not be forced to remain in unsafe situations due to financial barriers. A woman I know in my electorate told me a story of how her husband put a stop on their joint bank account when their relationship was breaking down. She was then unable to access her pay for a fortnight which had just been paid in. Her husband knew that this was the account her pay went into and knew she would not be able to pay her credit card off that month. What upset her the most was that the bank was able to do this without even alerting her first. There was not even a phone call. She was the other named account holder. No bank should be able to do this to a woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Financial abuse can also be withholding child support payments from an ex-partner to punish them, even though child support is specifically for the upkeep of a child who a person has helped bring into the world to help pay for their clothes, food, the electricity and internet in their home, the rent or mortgage on that home, their education and everything else involved with raising a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just last Friday, a woman came into my electorate office to talk to me about an issue that affects many women like her across this country, that of unpaid child support. She has done everything right. She has contacted the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Support" rel="nofollow">
             Child Support
            </a>
            agency numerous time about the unpaid payments, but because of the creative accounting of her ex-husband, who is not short of money, he is able to find various avenues to escape down to avoid paying what is owed to her for the upkeep of their children. He, like a lot of ex-partners, uses child support payments in an abusive way against his former partner to hurt her and, in turn, he hurts his children. This is financial abuse. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous but who gave permission to talk about her situation, is in dire financial straits currently. She's unable to work at the moment due to an injury but is keen to get back into the workforce. She is a highly skilled worker in her field and just needs someone on her side. Welfare payments barely cover her rent and bills. She is at breaking point and came to me in a desperate state.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would never want to see any government department, financial institution or any other organisation, for that matter, contribute to a woman's ongoing trauma and abuse. Ending violence against women and children, including financial abuse, is everybody's responsibility and business. We can all play a role in prevention, whether as colleagues in the workplace, workers in the community, financial institutions, local sporting groups and other community organisations or parents, carers, family and friends.

            <p>
             I am very pleased to support the motion from the member for Swan. Financial and economic abuse are forms of domestic violence. They are patterns of abusive behaviour by which an abuser uses money to exert power and control over their partner. Last year, more than 600,000 Australians were victims of financial abuse. Ninety per cent of women seeking help from domestic violence services report that they have experienced financial abuse, and we know that these figures underestimate the extent of the issue.

              Financial abuse
             </a>
             is prosecuted in different ways. Some people take out loans and credit cards in their partner's name, leaving them with debts and compromised credit ratings for years after the relationship ends. Some abuse their partners by not allowing them to work, by limiting their spending money, by forcing them to make early withdrawals from their superannuation, by making them take on debt against their will or sometimes even their knowledge or by taking control of their social security benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like all forms of domestic violence, financial abuse can happen to anyone regardless of their wealth or social economic status. It often develops and evolves insidiously. Coercive control, including financial abuse, is commonly described by victim-survivors as the worst form of abuse that they experienced. It can have a more immediate and ongoing impact than physical forms of violence, but it is also a predictor of severe physical violence and even homicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sadly, we have to acknowledge that the disabled are particularly susceptible to this form of abuse. The disability royal commission found that disabled women are abused almost twice as often as non-disabled women. Perpetrators can be anyone in the victim's life, but they are often their caregiver. Lack of access to financial resources and barriers to accessing social security entitlements can increase the risk of financial abuse of disabled people. Other forms of financial abuse against those people may include legal guardians denying access to money, services withholding disability support or government payments and support workers misusing National Disability Insurance Scheme funds.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have heard repeatedly from women in Kooyong about this issue. They have told me that they feel that their abusers are never held to account despite multiple reports filed with police and domestic violence orders against their perpetrators. In their view, sadly, police seem unable to act on allegations of coercive control, even when those perpetrators are in breach of court orders. I have heard from women who have lost their homes and who are now homeless due to financial abuse and forced to couch surf with friends. I am also hearing from many women who are distressed by the incidence of domestic violence in Australia more broadly about the anger that they feel that so little is done to curb the violence perpetrated against them.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are several steps that we can take, and that we must take, to address the important issue of financial and economic abuse. Firstly, we must support the existence of family violence financial counsellors to help abused individuals make a case for their debts to be waived or to be transferred back to the abusive family member. We should encourage large businesses to understand the need for policies and procedures that support customers who are experiencing domestic financial and economic abuse. I applaud the efforts of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
              Commonwealth Bank
             </a>
             and other institutions which are working to report technology facilitated abuse to law enforcement. Major businesses should provide trauma informed, culturally safe support, promoting the safety and wellbeing of survivors and holding people who choose to use this sort of violence to account. We have to improve police responses and we have to improve the way that the justice system supports victim-survivors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, we need to legislate a specific criminal offence of coercive and controlling behaviour in all states and territories of this country. We have to ensure that people who choose to use coercive control are held to account. Despite being one of the most insidious and most common forms of domestic violence, coercive control has been legislated as a standalone offence only in Tasmania. Movement in other states and territories has been too slow to date. We can and we must do more to protect Australians from financial and economic abuse.

               Financial abuse
              </a>
              is, without a doubt, a form of domestic and family violence. It can leave victims and survivors in unfathomable positions. Many do not recover; many do not survive. This must end. That is why I support this motion's unequivocal condemnation of the use of bank accounts to perpetrate abuse, the use of money to control victims of economic abuse, and the disgraceful exploitation, and in some cases sabotage, of a person's finances to undermine their financial security and limit their ability to be independent and self-sufficient.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the world continues to transition to online financial services, the rates of financial abuse are going to continue to increase if we do not act. A 2017 study on economic abuse between cohabiting partners found that 16 per cent of women and seven per cent of men had experienced financial abuse in their lifetimes. This study also established that age, disability, financial stress and health status were significant risk factors, especially for women. For example, 63 per cent of women who experienced high financial stress and 24 per cent of women with disability or long-term health conditions had experienced financial abuse as well. Middle-aged and older women also more commonly experienced financial abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many members of this House may have friends or family with firsthand experience of this type of abuse. I certainly have, and I saw that abuse cross and damage generations. It's critical that all governments work together on these issues. Inconsistency will cost lives and livelihoods. That's why governments at all levels need to be pulling in the same direction. As my colleagues have touched on, this issue cannot be left to one party, one government or one state or territory, nor can the resolution be left to a small part of the community. That is why this government, in partnership with state and territory governments across Australia, is committed to addressing the underlying factors that drive gender based violence as well as rates of violence.

              that we released along with the states and territories last year, this government has set a goal to end violence against women and children in one generation. The National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children aims to address the underlying drivers of gender based violence to prevent violence before it occurs; to intervene early and prevent further escalation; to respond appropriately when violence is used; and to support the recovery and healing of victims-survivors in ways which put them at the centre.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Albanese government has invested $2.3 billion in women's safety, including more than $326 million in prevention initiatives specifically across our first two budgets. This includes funding for initiatives like our consent and respectful relationships education, sexual violence prevention pilots and funding to support the work of Our Watch, the national leading organisation for the primary prevention of family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ending violence against women and children is everybody's responsibility and everybody's business. If we are to successfully end violence in one generation, we must ensure our social security safety net recognises the circumstances of people who are experiencing violence. Victims of family, domestic and sexual violence should not be unfairly punished as a result of how their relationship is recognised under social security law.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, I thank the member for Swan for moving this motion and for the leadership she has demonstrated on this issue. There will be many victims, survivors and organisations who will be empowered by the strong stance this parliament has taken on this issue, as well as by this parliament's united commitment to victims and survivors of financial abuse to ensure that we as a nation can enable generational change and eliminate it.

               I want to echo the member for Bean's words but also commend the member for Swan for this motion. It's a tough subject to talk about, but sometimes the toughest subjects are really the most important to talk about. We have an important role in this House in shining a light on challenging, difficult issues that impact a lot of people.
              </p>
              <p>
               A habit that I've had for many years is, on a Sunday, to read the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_Investor" rel="nofollow">
                Barefoot Investor
               </a>
               in the local paper, and I've always found it good; he was a great financial adviser, unofficially, to me, growing up, and I took on his 'buckets' theory. Reading it is something I've continued to do, because it gives me a great perspective on issues and challenges that people have, and, as an MP, I've found it quite helpful in that regard as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the weekend, there was a letter to him written by someone called Denise that really touched me at the time, and I think it's appropriate that I share it now, just to put a real person and a real story behind what we're talking about when we talk about financial abuse and the impact it will have. These are Denise's words. 'Dear Scott, I've been married for 35 years, and I am scared. I'm only 81 days away from accessing my super balance, which is $30,000. I need to take that money and escape from my husband. I would be leaving a property worth $1.7 million. Nothing is in my name, only the debt of $170,000 that is left on the mortgage. I know I'm losing everything I've worked for, but I'm scared of him and scared that he can take what I have left. I feel I need to take the money and go overseas so he can't find me.' When I read that on Sunday, it hit me hard. There's a lot in that that's challenging. There's obviously Denise's situation, but I think many in this House, reading that or listening to that at home, would realise the options she has and the reality. How can he own the $1.7 million house but she owe the debt? It defies financial logic.
              </p>
              <p>
               But we all, outside of the situation, understand that this is the perverse nature of financial abuse, domestic violence and the control that is exhibited in a partnership. It's important that we shine a light on that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Scott did give Denise some good advice, and I hope she takes that up. And to anyone listening at home who is in a tough situation: there is support out there for you; you have more options and more rights than you know. It's important that, across the aisle, weâ€”the government, the states, the not-for-profits and the banksâ€”all work together to support those who don't think they have an option.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's not pretend this is an easy situation. And I'm not at all trying to be political. I commend the government. Many have spoken about their strategy. It is important that we have a strategy and we work together. So I'm not, in any way, saying this to be political. But we need to acknowledge that it is complex and challenging. There are other issues at play, as well, with that domestic violence. Often, there's substance abuse; often, there are challenges from socioeconomic status. We need to recognise that and to not judge those in these situations but provide them with options and information.
              </p>
              <p>
               We also need to remember that, in many of these cases, there are young children and families that are involved. We need to think about what those children are seeing, what they're learning and what impact it's having on them. How can we help break the cycle and give them a safe place?
              </p>
              <p>
               I know that they're only a little thing, but breakfast programs at schools are vital. My wife is a teacher's aide, and I know the impact it has to give those who need it a little bit of normality. It's important that we do what we can to continue to break that cycle and to allow children to understand that it's not acceptable behaviour; it's not normal.
              </p>
              <p>
               The unfortunate reality in Victoria, with the lockdowns, was that many children were exposed to significant and difficult situations. We need to keep continuing to support those children and support those mothers that are caught in these tragic situations. So I commend the member for Swan for shining a light on this challenging issue.
