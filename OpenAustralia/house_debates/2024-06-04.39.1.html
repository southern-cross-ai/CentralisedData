        My question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services. With shocking revelations out of budget estimates last night that illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine, speed and ice are being trafficked through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">

        officials admitting, 'You name it; it's on the list,' why has the minister allowed illegal drugs to be trafficked to Australia's most vulnerable and paid for by taxpayers under the scheme that you designed?

          I want to acknowledge the member for Deakin's inaugural question to me on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          in this term of government. The NDIS is changing lives. I actually think that most members of the House are very committed to seeing the NDIS deliver the outcomes that it was designed to deliver for people with disability. But the NDIS needs to be got back on track.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member goes to one of the questions about the future of the scheme, which is making sure that every dollar gets through to the participants for whom it's designed. I agree that there are issues in terms of fraud in the scheme. But these issues of fraud did not start yesterday. The reality is that this scheme was initiated by Labor, and then the Liberals came into power and there's no doubt that they increased the size of the scheme. But I would have to mark their stewardship of the scheme as incompetent and naive because they failed to create systems—

             Resume your seat. I'll deal with it. I thought this was clear yesterday when I dealt with the member for Fairfax. The minister will pause and resume his seat for a moment. We're not going to have points of order with statements and have the standing orders being abused. I made that crystal clear yesterday with the member for Fairfax. As I just indicated to the member for Deakin, he was entitled under the standing orders to raise a point of order—of course, he's allowed to do that. I think he knows that the next course of action is that he will leave the chamber under 94(a) for abusing the standing orders.

            <p>
             The minister's going to return to the question. He wasn't asked about alternative approaches. He wasn't asked about the opposition. He was asked a specific question regarding estimates and issues raised through the estimates process. I'm going to make sure he's remaining directly relevant to the question.

                 NDIS
                </a>
                is a good idea, but under the coalition it was badly managed. One of the naive mistakes they made is that, whilst they paid out money to participants and service providers, they failed to do anything about the system into which they were paying it. We have 87 per cent of service providers who are unregistered. We have no way of knowing what they do when they put in their invoices.
               </p>
               <p>
                We also have a scheme where they didn't set up proper monitoring of the payment system. As I explained recently to the House, to my shock and horror upon becoming Minister for the NDIS, I discovered that, under the previous government, when payment applications, or requests to be paid, were made, the agency—we've rectified this now—would only check 20. That's 20 out of hundreds of thousands of claims daily. I then found out in particular that, between 5 pm and 6.30 pm on any given day, nothing got checked. They literally decided to get the money out so quickly that if you made a claim between five and 6.30—

                 The minister will pause. He's had two minutes, and I gave an instruction before. I can understand he's bringing some history into this issue, but the question wasn't about the history of what he's talking about. It was about a specific matter raised in the estimates. He's going to have to address that, otherwise he'll be resuming his seat.

                  We are getting on with fixing up the fraud. We have got 500-plus compliance matters under investigation. We have 222 investigations underway. We have 20 prosecutions in the court. We have another 12 matters currently with the

                  to consider. Clearly, it is illegal for anyone to claim items which are not allowed under the scheme. The one difference between us and those people opposite is we're doing something about fixing up the scheme. You did nothing.
