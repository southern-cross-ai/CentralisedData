       <p>
        The time for action is now. It's time that education about sexual consent becomes standard across Australian secondary schools. As students reach adolescence, they are discovering their independence, but with independence comes responsibility. Parents are key to teaching children the values of respectful relationships. But, let's be frank, parents can be the last to know that their son or daughter is sexually active. We all know they ask their mates, not their mums, about sex. But we can't leave it to their mates when it comes to the topic of sexual consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Understanding consent is a sensitive and serious issue that should be managed by parents and educators, not left to peers, and we know there is a problem about consent among adolescents. The

        </a>
        annual statistical report found that one in eight boys and one in 12 girls reported that they had engaged in unwanted sexual behaviour. We must make a change. We must provide the resources and better educate young people as they navigate what is a wonderful and essential part of being humanâ€”resources supported by the federal government, like the soon-to-be released and updated Respect Matters program.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not just adults calling for this. Secondary student Chanel Contos started an online petition calling for sexual consent to be taught in schools. It has more than 36,000 signatures. This matters. Everyone deserves to feel safe and we must teach our young people how to make sure they are, always.
