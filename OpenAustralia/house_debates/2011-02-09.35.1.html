        This weekend we celebrate the exciting Whittlesea Country Music Festival. This annual celebration brings the cream of Australian country music and all things country to the historic township of Whittlesea. It is a great local tradition in my community and it returns, bringing the community together, including those affected by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">

        bushfires.
       </p>
       <p>
        The festival has become a symbolic event for my communities following the cancellation of the festival in February 2009 due to the impacts of the fires. The showgrounds that were to be used for the festival became a staging ground for emergency service vehicles. In the years that have followed, the volunteer organisers of the Whittlesea Country Music Festival have worked extremely hard to ensure this long, proud tradition in the township continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a time when we will celebrate our strength, determination and courage and come together and enjoy the best that Australian country music has to offer. The continuation of the show is a testament to the dedication of the many locals who drive and grow this fantastic event. Beginning on 11 February we will have three days of country music, with more than 40 acts performing at many venues including the Saturday street party. There will be acts from top performers, including

        Over the weekend there is plenty to do and see for you and your family and friends, with things like the famous street party, many local gigs, the Victorian and National Country Music Awards and the famous truck and ute show. There will be lots of local produce to try and enjoy. It is a great event and I encourage all members to make their way down and enjoy what Whittlesea has to offer this weekend.
