        The idea of hundreds of motorcycles riding through Perth's leafy western suburbs may have alarmed a few of the local residents, but last month around 500

        bikers, including myself and my fellow Burt bikers, took to the streets to ride dapper. Dressed in our finest and most dapper garb—me in a red bowtie and yellow gloves—we joined thousands of men and women across the world on the Distinguished Gentleman's Ride, organised by the Perth Cafe Racers. As the proud owner of a

        that I had not ridden for quite some time due to campaigning, I admit that I jumped at the chance to join the riders, but it was all for a good cause. Across the world more than 50,000 riders took to the streets to raise much-needed funds for men's prostate cancer research and for men's mental health support. Internationally, more than $3.5 million was raised, and in Perth we raised over $100,000. More than 3,000 men die in Australia each year from prostate cancer. We can find a cure, but that requires funding.

        It is fitting during World Mental Health Week and following the inaugural headspace day to note the importance of doing everything we can to ensure that those living with mental ill health receive the necessary support and funding. Reducing the stigma around mental health issues is vital, which is why there is always a place for raising awareness. And nothing attracts a crowd quite like a few hundred bikers in blazers and bowties. So congratulations to Perth Cafe Racers on yet another successful Distinguished Gentleman's Ride, and here's to riding dapper again this time next year.
