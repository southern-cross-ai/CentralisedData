       <p>
        I rise today to update the House on the progress of the radiation oncology facility in Darwin. I am somewhat relieved to report that the Northern Territory government have at least agreed to work with the Australian government to build a new radiation oncology unit for Territorians. It has not been easy to get this process underway. The Australian government has basically had to drag the Northern Territory government kicking and screaming to the table.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really cannot forgive the nonchalant attitude of the Martin government when it comes to caring for people with cancer. I remind the House it was

        ,

        of the Northern Territory, who promised the radiation oncology facility to Territorians as an election promise during the 2001 and 2005 elections. It should come as no surprise to this House that I have worked hard to deliver this radiation oncology unit and I believe, after much investigation, the promises of the Northern Territory government were falsely made as a meagre vote winner for the last elections without any real intention of following them through. It is unethical and callous.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government will be working closely with the Northern Territory to get the ball rolling and the process finished as quickly as possible. So far, the Northern Territory health department have submitted a time frame which I believe is far too drawn out, and the Australian government will be making every effort to expedite the process to get this facility operational.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can confirm to the House that it is the Australian government’s intention to carry out the tender process to build and operate the facility. We are negotiating with the Territory government on those terms and we will be ensuring that all negotiations are above board. I see no reason why the tender process cannot be over by the end of this year so that construction can begin at the start of the 2007 dry season in May next year. This means that the facility should be built around the end of next year and fully operational after a service testing period by early 2008.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        government’s time frame envisages that the facility will be operational by 2009. I will be working to ensure that the facility will be built well in advance of that time frame. Territorians should have had this facility built years ago, so there is no more time for any further Northern Territory government procrastination. Until recently, there has been a complete failure on the part of the Northern Territory government.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for cost, I advise the House that the government has always believed that $14 million was the cost of setting up this facility. The Australian government has committed at least $13 million in this year’s federal budget. It is my understanding that at this stage the Northern Territory government will contribute a meagre $1 million and the land on which to build the facility, when the site is chosen. In my view, Territorians should feel ripped off and let down by their government, who now refuse to contribute adequately financially to the radiation oncology unit that they promised and failed to deliver. It is now time to look beyond that. It is now time to get the facility operational so that Territorians suffering the burden of cancer will suffer no more than they need to. I will advise the House of outcomes as they occur.
