        Today I want to talk about the virtues of the

        , which is happening in my electorate of Chisholm. Chisholm is an electorate high within the education sphere. We have two very large and world renowned universities. We have one of the country’s most pre-eminent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        s and a smaller TAFE that does great work in industry. Chisholm is also home to 46 schools, some of them phenomenal schools producing great results. In my electorate I am blessed to have some terrific private schools and also some phenomenal state schools who turn out some of the state’s best

        results. Indeed, around this time of year my office is undated with calls from frustrated parents who cannot get their children into

        . I think this is unfair. I think every parent should want their children to go to the school that is near them and that every school should be an excellent school.

        I am really pleased that the

        , a great local high school. Indeed, it was the high school I grew up next door to, but my parents decided that I had to travel miles away to a Catholic school instead of going to the local state school. It is a phenomenal institution that has been doing phenomenal things for a long time. Under the science and language learning centres initiative, we have recently announced that Ashwood College will receive $1,970,000 in funding to construct a new science centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to be out at the school the other day with Principal Kerrie Croft and the two school captains, who are madly studying for the final run of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAC" rel="nofollow">
         SAC
        </a>
        s and end-of-year exams towards the inevitable TER result that determines where they may go next year. Both were great advocates for their school and were lamenting that, as we announced this terrific science centre, they are leaving the environment and will not actually get to enjoy it. The science centre will include two science laboratories, one environmental science laboratory, two multipurpose rooms, a prep room and an outdoor learning court. Ashwood College has an exceptional record in promoting science and this new building will provide numerous possibilities for the staff and students at the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, the rest of the school building has been allowed to run down. It is like a lot of infrastructure in the area. My family moved into the area when it was first developed over 40 years ago, and the school was built just prior to that. The school will also get some National School Pride money, which will go towards revamping its canteen. That does not sound like a great thing but it is a really important thing for the school community. The canteen fronts the gate and it looks terrible for people walking by. People say buildings are not important to schools, but they really are. Buildings are important in giving the impression to the rest of the community that we take pride in these environments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The learning outcomes of Ashwood College have been terrific. It runs a phenomenal arts and music program and I have been delighted to be present at many of their school events. I am absolutely delighted they have got this money.
