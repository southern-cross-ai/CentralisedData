       <p>
        On Saturday, 14 of February I took part in the West Beach Surf Life Saving Club's annual Pink Swim, a fundraising event to support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         National Breast Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        . The West Beach Surf Life Saving Club is one of five clubs in my electorate of Hindmarsh, all of which are dedicated to providing a service to the community and all those who use the beach. One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, so fundraising events like the Pink Swim are extremely important. I congratulate President Peter Zuill, the West Beach Surf Life Saving Club and the Pink Swim Team, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Davis" rel="nofollow">

        -Bishop, for their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 600 people turned out to support the Pink Swim, which is in its third year and going from strength to strength. Last year I attended as a spectator. However, this year I was privileged to don a pink cap and join with my wife and the hundreds of participants who took part in a swim of either 200, 400, 700 or 1,000 metres. The Pink Swim raised over $11,000, beating the 2014 levelâ€”a terrific achievement. The funds will go towards research programs aimed at the prevention and cure of breast cancer and help the National Breast Cancer Foundation reach its goal of working towards zero deaths from breast cancer by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        The West Beach Surf Life Saving Club had great community support from the City of Charles Sturt Council and Adelaide Shores and many other local businesses who sponsored the event. I was pleased to be joined in the event by South Australian Liberal Leader Steven Marshall and Deputy Leader Vickie Chapman, who helped to support the event. I look forward to taking part in the Pink Swim again in 2016.
