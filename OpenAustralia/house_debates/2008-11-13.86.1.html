       <p>
        I have only been the shadow minister for health and ageing for a short period of time but I have met some wonderful and amazing people and I have read some incredible and inspiring stories. People who have diabetes and those who support the awareness of the growing epidemic of diabetes certainly tell a remarkable story and they should be commended for the work they have done in our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge in the gallery today Dr Gary Deed, the National President of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Diabetes Australia
        </a>
        . He leads an inspirational organisation that is making a significant difference in people’s lives. Tonight he will be attending the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Diabetes_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Diabetes Day
        </a>
        gala dinner in Canberra, which I know a number of people from this House will be attending. I know that it receives wide support—the cause generally but the dinner tonight and the celebration of Diabetes Day tomorrow in particular.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge as part of my contribution to this debate tonight the wonderful work of the member for Pearce,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Moylan" rel="nofollow">
         Judi Moylan
        </a>
        . She is a person with remarkable character who set up the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. She works very closely with Dr Mal Washer, Mr Mark Dreyfus, Senator Guy Barnett, Mr Dick Adams and Mr Cameron Thompson, the former member for Blair. With Diabetes Australia and a number of other organisations they have been able to make some tangible contributions directly through the work that they have done. For that, today I commend them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts are with those people who are suffering from diabetes. Earlier this week, Diabetes Australia launched their online map, which can be found at www.diabetesmap.com.au. The statistics on that site show that there are 128,652 people in this country with type 1 diabetes and 709,919 with type 2 diabetes. The profile reveals a number of other statistics as well. People can visit the site to get an understanding of exactly how many people in their area have diabetes and what they face. The growing number of people with diabetes in this country is striking and it is something that, in a bipartisan way, members on both sides of this chamber need to be united in challenging.
       </p>
       <p>
        Diabetes Australia, along with a number of other organisations and along with people like the member for Pearce and her group, create awareness and strive for prevention, detection and management, but ultimately a cure. That is why the former government, followed by this government, provided important research funding, and some of the funding has been quite remarkable. I know that the member for Pearce and other players are very proud of the funding that has been able to flow to organisations. There was $5½ million allocated in the May 2008 budget to make insulin pump technology more affordable for families who have a child under 18 with type 1 diabetes. We want to work with the government to implement the coalition’s policy to make the pumps available to more people so that they can manage their diabetes more effectively. There was a $15.3 million commitment by the government towards consumables used with the insulin pumps. That builds on considerable work that was done by the coalition government in association with the industry groups. I think that was a highlight of our period in government and I am sure that it will continue under this government as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the dinner tonight I am looking forward to seeing Billy Renouf and Dominic Clark from my electorate. Together with a number of other young adults they have been on quite an arduous walk today, which, to their credit, they did as part of raising awareness of Diabetes Day. I am sure that they will be looking forward to having something to eat tonight and that they will sleep well when they get into their beds. They will certainly deserve a break. I have also had contact over the years in my electorate with Jack Yorston, who tells a wonderful story. He has got type 1 diabetes and he is reflective of the wonderful spirit of kids all around the country that deserve our support.
