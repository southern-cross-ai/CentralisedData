        In March, retail billionaire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Lew" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Lew
        </a>
        reportedly cried as he spoke to the Treasurer, urging him to create JobKeeper. His firm, Premier Investments, temporarily closed stores such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Jeans" rel="nofollow">
         Just Jeans
        </a>
        and Portmans, receiving around $45 million in JobKeeper payments from the taxpayer. Six months later, Premier Investments announced profits 29 per cent higher than last year and paid shareholders a $57 million dividend. As the largest shareholder, Lew himself received more than $20 million. A policy designed to help battlers ended up benefiting a billionaire.
       </p>
       <p>
        Premier Investments also paid its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        a $2 million bonus. They're not alone. Healthia got $8 million in JobKeeper and paid over $100,000 in bonuses. Integral Diagnostics got $5 million in JobKeeper and paid over $200,000 in bonuses. Carsales got $5 million in JobKeeper and paid over $400,000 in bonuses. Capitol Health got $5 million in JobKeeper and paid over $700,000 in bonuses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday in the Senate, Labor moved to prevent firms getting JobKeeper from paying bonuses. The coalition voted against it. That puts them at odds with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Business Council of Australia
        </a>
        and with the tax office. As Second Commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn recently warned, paying bonuses out of JobKeeper would be seen as 'exploiting the spirit of the measures'. With a million unemployed, why is the Morrison government shovelling cash to millionaires?
