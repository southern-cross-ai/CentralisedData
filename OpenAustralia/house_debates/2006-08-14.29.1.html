        In my electorate of Macquarie, 27 schools have recently benefited from grants of up to $1,500 under the Australian government’s Healthy School Communities Program. They have each developed projects to involve their wider school communities in educating our young people to live healthy, active lifestyles. For example, Katoomba North Public School is introducing fruit and water breaks for its students to encourage healthy eating and healthy drinking habits. They are also inviting guest nutritionists and dieticians to speak to their students about why they should choose an apple over a packet of chips at the canteen.

        is setting up a kids’ cafe, with the help of volunteers from the local community, to provide its young adults with healthier food choices. Grose View Public School is developing a vegetable garden to show children the fun in eating healthily. I recently opened a similar vegetable garden at Blaxland East Public School, constructed with funding in an earlier round. The Australian government’s $116 million Building a Healthy, Active Australia initiative is taking a proactive approach in fighting the epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes as well as other lifestyle related diseases. By teaching healthy eating and regular exercise in our schools, we are paving the way for future generations of healthy young people and healthy adults.
