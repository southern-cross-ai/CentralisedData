       <p>
        I appreciate the opportunity to rise and pay tribute to the guides in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        who bring our school groups around. On this particular occasion I would like to welcome the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_Entrance" rel="nofollow">
         Lakes Entrance
        </a>
        Primary School students who are in the southern gallery at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think I speak for all members when I say that we deeply appreciate the work the guides do. In this case, Monique is showing the children from Lakes Entrance around and giving them a very good understanding of our democratic process. I think it is a very important role that the guides play in this House, along with the Parliamentary Education Office.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is so important that young people in our community have the opportunity to come to our parliament and to perhaps see the positive side of the work we do as members of parliament, and also to see the rough and tumble of question time in just a few minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure that all members feel greatly honoured and privileged to represent their constituents in this place, and there is no better occasion than greeting a school group from your own electorate to get a sense of home coming to Canberra. I appreciate the children from Lakes Entrance's being here today and I welcome them in the public gallery and look forward to working with them into the future.

         If I
        </a>
        could have one message to the Lakes Entrance Primary School students who are here today, it would be to encourage them to take this opportunity in their educational life. Schools are a place where dreams come true. If you work your hardest and strive to be your absolute best, I am sure you can go on to achieve great things in life. I welcome you to Canberra and I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit.
