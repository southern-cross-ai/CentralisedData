       <p>
        When I first challenged the Prime Minister to a public debate on climate change, he refused, saying that the coalition had no policy. Well, Mr Policy—Mr Speaker; first time nerves, Mr Speaker—we have a policy which is simpler, cheaper and clearer than the government’s, and I renew my question: does the Prime Minister have the guts to have a nationally televised debate about climate change—my direct action versus his great big tax?

        <p>
         Mr Speaker, thank you for that question without notice from Mr Policy! It is about policy, and can I say to those opposite: the proceedings of this parliament are broadcast daily. We are here all week, we are here all next week and we are here for five weeks in the current sittings. If the honourable gentleman wishes to engage in a debate on the future of climate change, I welcome that debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         First of all, it would be a debate about whether or not we accept the science of climate change. We have a view on that. Someone opposite says that climate change is, to use his own words ‘absolute crap’. Secondly, we would have a debate to respond to the honourable gentleman’s question about whether or not the policies on offer have an effect, and I think that is pretty interesting when you look at what has been put out there into the public space today, because those opposite have not put a cap on carbon pollution at all. We have put a cap on carbon pollution because that is the first test. The second test is this: do you actually charge those who are the biggest polluters or let them off scot-free? Those opposite have decided to let the biggest polluters off scot-free, and guess what they are doing: they are going to charge the Australian taxpayer instead. Thirdly, for the flow-on consequences for working families, we offer compensation. Those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, offer one big fat zero.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, Mr Speaker, the honourable gentleman asks: ‘Shall we have a debate?’ I thought that that was one of the reasons the parliament was here assembled—to debate the big challenges. If his preoccupation is being on television, can I just say that there are cameras all around here, it is on every day and long may it continue thus. I therefore respond to the honourable gentleman’s question by saying, ‘Yes, and let us have the debate in the people’s house.’
