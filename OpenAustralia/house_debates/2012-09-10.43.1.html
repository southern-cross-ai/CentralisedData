        I am not sure that the students of Scone Grammar School are here yet but I acknowledge them. They will be visiting the

        I had the pleasure yesterday to join with

        President Ged Kearney at the 17th annual miners memorial service at the

        headquarters in Cessnock. Of course it is about remembering the more than 1,800 men and boys whose names appear on the memorial wall at the miners' headquarters in Cessnock. That is 1,800 too many. It is important that all in this place recognise and remember the importance of workplace safety. In a sense, we are not just reflecting on those who gave their lives mining coal on the northern coalfields; we are also celebrating the fact that each year—thankfully, this year it is nil—fewer and fewer new names appear on the wall. That has been the case over recent decades because parliaments have become engaged in partnership with the union movement in ensuring that we have decent workplace safety. May that always be the case.

        Yesterday, concern was expressed about developments in Queensland, where the new government under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">

        is seeking to contract out, if you like, the work of mine safety officers who are employed by the union. All of us stand in this place to ensure that a safe workplace remains in place.
