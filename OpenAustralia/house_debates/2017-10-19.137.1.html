       <p>
        Recently, I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister for Urban Infrastructure to Dunkley. I am delighted to advise my colleagues in the chamber that the business case for the electrification and duplication of the Frankston train line to Baxter is finally on track and going ahead, as the state government have now agreed to get on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 22nd of September was a momentous day as it was the day that we were able to announce that, after the federal funding had been on the table and been ignored for almost a year, the state government had now agreed to pursue the business case for the Baxter electrification that I announced prior to the federal election last year, with $4 million of federal funding going towards this business case.

        and Baxter in Dunkley, as well as places further down such as Somerville and Moorooduc in my neighbour the Minister for Health's electorate of Flinders, are a part of a major growth corridor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        , and the demand for better public interest services is clear. Frankston Station, currently, bears the burden of being the last metro station on the line, and so many residents who live further down the peninsula currently park at Frankston to catch the train into the city. By extending the metro line, more Dunkley residents will be able to take the train from their local station, and the burden will be eased on the stations at Frankston, Kananook and Seaford, benefiting both locals at the revitalised stations and those at the current metro stations further up the line.

        electrification project will help connect businesses, education facilities, institutions and health centres. It will create 4,000 jobs—not to mention the indirect jobs—cut unemployment in our area by up to one per cent and reduce youth disengagement by up to two per cent. Transport congestion would be eased. Additional benefits will be provided for peninsula tourism, for

        , as well as for the rest the region, by making the peninsula more accessible by public transport and by establishing a demand for reverse commuting. The electrification will extend the metro rail to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , providing much-needed accessibility and easing the parking issues at the hospital; Leawarra station, at the university; a new Langwarrin railway station; and Baxter station, which would open the door for park-and-ride options as well as the relocation of stabling yards.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the extent of opportunities that come with the Baxter electrification are still being met by some resistance from the Andrews Labor government in Victoria. They have determined that they will plough through with the wasteful effort to move the Carrum train stabling yards from Carrum to Kananook in Seaford, risking the livelihoods of 200 employees over several businesses, some of which have been established at the current site for over 50 years. Colleagues will recall my previous mentions of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Page" rel="nofollow">
         Steven Page
        </a>
        , owner of Page Brothers Jayco, whose land is being compulsory acquired by the state government, derailing his business, which has been built up over so many years, and placing jobs in jeopardy. Not only was this move of the stabling yards to Seaford never necessary, but it breaks your heart that the state Victorian government has opted to attack a Victorian leisure and lifestyle institution when an alternative has been presented by means of our Baxter electrification plan for stabling—an alternative that was an option long before the stabling yards move was announced.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to be joined recently by the new Liberal candidate for Carrum, Donna Bauer, as well by the member for Hastings and the shadow small business minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Burgess
        </a>
        , in their efforts advocating against the Victorian state Labor government's plans to move the stabling yards to Seaford and take 200 jobs. Plenty of currently unused land exist at or near Baxter station. It makes sense that the stabling yards are relocated there to vacant, unused land rather than harming a number of local Dunkley businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turnbull coalition government's $4 million business plan has the support of the local council, who are also devastated to see the harm to our local industries by the reckless and short-sighted Andrews Labor government. There is so much potential for infrastructure and development opportunities with the Baxter electrification project. The Dunkley community and I would hate to see it wasted or manipulated to the detriment of our local businesses. We are calling for the support of the state Labor government to ensure that this project goes ahead and benefits everyone in Dunkley, including all of those businesses in Seaford who are potentially now going to lose their businesses and risk jobs.
