        The failings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
         BER
        </a>
        have been well documented. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted because the government saw fit to remove the rights of local communities to have input into what was best for their local situation. Some schools ended up with school canteens that cannot fit into a pie warmer. Some schools had to stand by while their tennis courts were demolished to make way for a basketball stadium that was too small to fit the court.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government also insisted that it handle the process of appointing the building contactors who would carry out this work. Local builders, who employ local labour and purchase their materials from local suppliers, were overlooked in favour of the big companies, who used drive-in-drive-out workers and materials that were purchased out of town.
       </p>
       <p>
        I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the proposed library at the Wowan State School in my electorate. In May this year the Queensland government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        advised the school that the indicative cost of building the library was $850,000. Within weeks the school was advised that the project would be subject to a cost over-run of $110,000, taking the total cost to $960,000. The alternative was that the school could accept a smaller building that would not be suitable for the job—or they could have demountables. On 14 September the President of the Wowan State Primary School P&amp;C Association advised the department that they would not accept the price as quoted nor would they accept a substandard building or a reduced size from that which was originally planned. Since then, the P&amp;C has obtained a quote from Cavalier Homes in Biloela for $589,000 to build the building as per the original proposal. The school and the P&amp;C will get a building that they need, taxpayers will save $371,000, a local builder will get to employ local workers and local suppliers will get to provide the materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a win-win for everyone, Mr Speaker. But wait—this is where it gets scary. The department will not give a contract to a company that is not accredited by them, so they refuse to entertain the local quote. The chairman of the Wowan State School building committee has been frustrated in his dealings with the department because of their arrogant ‘we know best’ attitude and their insistence on giving the contract to a large multinational company.
       </p>
       <p>
        Baralaba State School, also in my electorate, was yesterday advised of a cost over-run on their project, too, and building has not even commenced. What on earth is going on, Mr Speaker? Cavalier Homes in Biloela is prepared to complete the accreditation. In fact, they commenced the paperwork yesterday and are well on the way to obtaining accreditation to enable them to do the work. Why should the government allow this ridiculous situation to continue? It is not too late to give the BER scheme some credibility. I call upon the minister to intervene to allow the Wowan and Baralaba State Primary School P&amp;Cs the opportunity to build something at their school that they really need. Allow them to appoint the local builder to do the job.
