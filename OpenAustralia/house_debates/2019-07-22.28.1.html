       <p>
        Last week saw the under-21 national hockey championships being held at the newly upgraded Far North Coast Regional Hockey Centre in Lismore. I obtained a grant of nearly $750,000 to upgrade this facility. Far North Coast Hockey, the Lismore council and private donors made up the balance of this $1.6 million project.
       </p>
       <p>
        This investment is already now bringing much more into our community. In the last 12 months alone there have been six major events at the facility, including the Men's Masters Australian Hockey Championships. These tournaments have brought approximately 1,800 players and supporters to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in the last 12 months, bringing literally millions of dollars. It's a fantastic outcome for all the motels and other businesses in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were several players from the recent under-21 tournament that I would like to acknowledge.

        and Reece Gaddes played in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Young" rel="nofollow">

        played in the women's team. Taquira McGrath and Erin Lidbetter competed in the women's New South Wales Blues team, and Luca Brown and Tyler Arundell both competed for the Queensland state team. I congratulate Paul Leadbeatter, who was the chairman of the organising committee, and his team of Christine Goderall, Jenny Pearson, Jan Hutton, Wendy Trudgeon and Clint Mallett. I'd also like to acknowledge the Lismore Workers Club, who sponsored the entire New South Wales hockey squad for the event.
