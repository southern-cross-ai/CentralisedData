         I thank the member for his question. I recognise his ongoing interest in national security matters and the great work he is doing as a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
          Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
         </a>
         . On the 70th anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         treaty it's worth reflecting on the strength of our alliance and the great strides that we have made together in addressing a range of challenges. It's a fact that COVID is not the only challenge to our safety and security, and it's a fact that serious and organised crime and terrorism are threats that don't recognise borders. That's why our government continues to build ties and work extremely closely with allied nations, particularly our ANZUS partners, who are also part of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" rel="nofollow">
          Five Eyes
         </a>
         intelligence network.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've had a number of meetings recently with US Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas on a range of national security issues. Of course, our two nations will continue to work very closely and very effectively on a range of operational issues. We've seen that just recently, with the success of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         's Operation Ironside. That operation was borne out of the very close relationship between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" rel="nofollow">
          FBI
         </a>
         and the AFP. It's been a very longstanding relationship that has served Australia and the United States very well. Our international network was mobilised and we worked very collaboratively on the technology that enabled us to listen in on criminal networks and, ultimately, to be able to take them down. This has made Australia a safer place by taking drugs and crime bosses off our streets. So far, 293 offenders have been charged and close to 5,000 kilograms of drugs have been seized. Australia is also a big beneficiary under an historic new data-sharing agreement with the US, which will give our local law enforcement agencies more tools for the fight on crime. Having passed enabling legislation in June of this year, we are now looking to settle and finalise the terms of that agreement and to do that before the end of this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to national security and when it comes to the safety of our community, Australians know that this government, the coalition government, is a government that they can rely on to keep them safe and secure. We're absolutely getting on with the job of making sure that we are looking after the best interests of Australians, and we are taking every action that we possibly can to ensure they are safe and secure at home and in their communities.
