        The date 25 November is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, otherwise known as White Ribbon Day. As one of the White Ribbon Day ambassadors, I, along with a number of members from both sides of the House, as well as businesspeople, sports leaders and others in the community, take very seriously the fact that males have to stand up and say clearly and unequivocally that violence of any kind against women is not acceptable. It could be violence against someone’s mother, someone’s niece, someone that we know in the family or someone’s grandmother. In Australia, the level of violence against women is unacceptably high. Over their lifetimes, about one in three women will experience some act of violence against them. It is simply unacceptable. The emotional cost is extreme. The financial cost is estimated at over $8 billion a year.

        committed himself to on White Ribbon Day, but additionally to have a private response to it. It is not acceptable that there is violence of any kind against women.
