        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that racist hate speech was hurled during a violent brawl at a Liberal Party meeting last night, with a witness reporting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They started bashing him and then they took him outside and started kicking at him … To be honest, I thought he was going to die.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the Prime Minister refer Liberal Party members using racist hate speech to the Human Rights Commission under section 18C of the

        , notwithstanding his personal objection to that section?

          There are many things within the Prime Minister's responsibility, but this is not one of them. While it's a serious matter that's been raised by the member for Isaacs, it has been referred to the police, and that is the appropriate place through which it should be dealt, not by the Prime Minister in question time when it's not his responsibility as the federal leader.

           yet again, I'm happy to hear from the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, but I think the responsibilities of ministers and the Prime Minister are very clear. We've been over this ground many times before. The Prime Minister is not responsible for party matters—and, actually, the Leader of the Opposition isn't either. I don't think the question is in order. I'm happy to hear a case from the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business.

             Racial Discrimination Act

            , section 18C, and the possibility of a referral of any Australian citizen who has used racist hate speech to the Human Rights Commission. It's something on which the Prime Minister has often spoken, and he has, indeed, supported attempts to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. That's what the question goes to.

            <p>
             The first part of the question is certainly not in order. For the assistance of the House, I'm going to remind the House of my previous rulings on parts of questions being out of order and I'm going to say quite candidly that, in my view, it was deliberately out of order. I'm going to say that very candidly and I'm going to rule very harshly on those in the future, as I have in the past. I'm giving the member for Isaacs, as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the benefit of the doubt on this one occasion today. I don't think the second part of the question is in order myself, but I'm prepared to let the Prime Minister address it if he wishes to.

              The Attorney just passed me a note which advises that only an aggrieved party can refer matters to the

               Australian Human Rights Commission
              </a>
              . That is the first point. In terms of the incident, the statement that the New South Wales Liberal Party has put out reads as follows:

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The Liberal Party strongly condemns the kind of behaviour that is alleged to have occurred.
