       <p>
        I just want to echo some of our colleagues in this place as we celebrate National Volunteer Week last week. Today I wish to acknowledge the tireless contributions that our volunteers in the election of Braddon make to each and every one of their respective communities. Not a minute would go by, whether it's day or night, when one of these volunteers is not having a positive life-changing or life-saving impact on someone in the region. Last week I was lucky enough to catch up with some of the incredible volunteers at the Waratah-Wynyard Council. I know similar events were held right across Braddon to acknowledge the contribution and generosity of all our volunteers right along the coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers form the beating heart of our nation, but, unfortunately, the COVID pandemic has taken its toll on many organisations and the number of volunteers is in decline. The volunteers that I met last week all had one thing in common: they all agreed that they got back far more than they ever gave. No matter your interests—whether in sport, the environment, health, the care sector, the arts, youth mentoring, emergency services or animal welfare, and the list goes on—there's a volunteer organisation that could use your help today. It's good for you, and it's vital for the ongoing prosperity of our nation.
