        The aged-care royal commission gave people hope that aged care would change for the better. But, despite being singled out for criticism by the royal commission, things seem to have only gotten worse at Tasmania's

        Care. For instance, constituents have told me terrible stories of neglect, including medications being missed and residents suffering avoidable injuries. The staff are hurting too, with a staggering turnover rate pointing to dreadful culture and moraleâ€”made all the worse, no doubt, by Southern Cross's proposal to cut some enrolled nurses and to replace them with lower-paid staff.

No wonder more than 1,000 people have signed a petition calling on the CEO and the board to resign. I urge the federal government to intervene and to ensure Southern Cross starts treating staff and residents with the care and respect they deserve. Anything less would be too little, too late.
