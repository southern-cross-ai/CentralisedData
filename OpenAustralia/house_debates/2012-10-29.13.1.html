       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the committee's report, incorporating additional comments, entitled
        <i>
         The prevention and treatment of problem gambling
        </i>
        , together with the evidence received by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received 60 submissions and heard from many witnesses. On the committee's behalf I thank all of those who assisted the inquiry, in particular those people who have battled gambling addiction and who bravely came forward to help us try to find a solution. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat, which did a fine job organising the inquiry and wading through an enormous amount of material.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the first part of the report the committee's main findings centre on the need to increase the focus on the prevention of problem gambling and, in particular, the problem we have in Australia with the lack of balanced messaging on gambling and the excessive focus on personal responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard that the message of 'responsible gambling' reinforces the view that it is up to individuals to gamble responsibly and that, if they do not, there must be something wrong with them. The problem is that this can shame people into silence and create a barrier to seeking help, which may be one reason that so few people actually do seek help for a gambling problem—in fact, only eight to 17 per cent tend to seek help and, when they do so, it is only as a last resort, because they have reached crisis point. To remedy this, the committee makes a number of suggestions to improve the effectiveness of messaging, including better crafted messages, better targeted messages and tactics like changing messages frequently so they do not become stale.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also heard about the need for the industry to take greater responsibility for the dangers of gambling products. For instance, in the area of staff training, the committee was concerned to hear that, despite showing obvious signs of problematic gambling in venues, none of the former problem gamblers who spoke to the committee had been approached by staff. This appears to be an admission that the current training, focused on staff interventions, is simply not working.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although they are helpful for some gamblers, the committee also heard of the limitations and mixed experiences of self-exclusion programs. The committee heard that some programs are complex, that they require photos to be taken and that there may be a need to reapply after a period of time. Moreover, people cannot self-exclude from all venues at one time, so they may only need to travel a short distance to be able to gamble at another venue. No wonder the committee sees merit in state-wide self-exclusion programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard from a number of treatment providers in clinical and non-clinical settings as well as support groups and was able to consider a range of possible improvements to the current system from the perspective of those working in the sector. For instance, the committee is attracted to the concept of integrated treatment services to deal with the complications with comorbid conditions, to the need to integrate awareness of gambling addiction across the wider health profession to ensure better referral pathways and to improvements to qualifications and training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, as with its previous inquiries, gambling research and data collection was highlighted to the committee. Areas requiring attention include: a much better evidence base and the importance of independent research and transparency of funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two chapters of additional comments. There is one by me in which I outline my concerns with the current state of gambling reform and the very real likelihood of no reform because of the Greens' unwillingness to compromise. Again I call on the Greens to understand the importance of establishing the precedent of the value of this to future and more substantial reform, and again I call on the government to table its reforms and to use the parliament as the place to argue for them and to fight for support, as it seems it is prepared to do with the wheat bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also a chapter by Senators Xenophon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
         Di Natale
        </a>
        , Madigan and me outlining areas where we think the committee report does not go far enough—in particular, the need for a legislated duty of care. Frankly, despite all the claims from the industry about staff training and wanting to assist problem gamblers, the committee heard repeatedly from problem gamblers who gambled at the same venues for extended periods—sometimes years—and who were known to staff but never approached about their excessive gambling. Putting a legal onus on venues to protect such people would, we believe, go a long way to cleaning up an industry more beholden to its commercial self-interest than to the public interest. I commend the report to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

        <p>
         As the Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform I have the pleasure to speak on the tabling of the committee's third report today. The focus of the reports is the prevention and treatment of problem gambling.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government takes seriously the need to address problem gambling in Australia. This committee's report recommends a number of ways to continue to improve prevention measures and treatment services in Australia, recognising that there is no single solution to address problem gambling.
        </p>
        <p>
         I draw the House's attention to the committee's view, set out in the early part of the report, that a public health approach to tackling problem gambling is needed. A public health approach aims to prevent problems arising from gambling. It involves the promotion of community and individual wellbeing, including alternatives to gambling behaviour—for example, through information and awareness campaigns. A public health framework also takes the focus off individual personal responsibility, which can be stigmatising, and broadens responsibility for preventing program gambling across the community and industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         To help drive a public health approach to gambling, the committee recommends prioritising gambling research under the banner of health research. This could be done by designating gambling as a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health
         </a>
         Priority Area under the National Health and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research Council
         </a>
         , and as an 'associated priority goal' under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Research Council
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The first part of the report looks at prevention measures to reduce the rate of problem gambling. The committee heard about the mixed messages being broadcast to the community about gambling. Currently, it is promoted by the industry as a harmless form of entertainment but this is not balanced by clear information about the possible risks. Changing public attitudes to gambling is important. Current messages around 'responsible gambling' reinforce the idea that the individual alone is responsible if a gambling problem develops and that they have only themselves to blame. The committee heard throughout the inquiry that this creates shame and stigma, which then becomes a huge barrier to seeking help for problem gambling. People tend to seek help only as a last resort and feel discouraged from seeking help early. Witnesses provided a number of suggestions about how to improve the messages used in social marketing initiatives—including campaigns, education initiatives and professional training—to address stigma and stereotypes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second part of the report considers what measures the gambling industry can take to minimise the harm gambling can cause. The committee heard about the need for the industry to take greater responsibility for the dangers of gambling products, like poker machines. It was concerning to hear that despite showing obvious signs of problematic gambling in venues, none of the problem gamblers who spoke to the committee had been approached by staff. The committee suggests some measures to improve staff training and also recommends strengthening self-exclusion programs to assist problem gamblers. The committee also supports legislation for the forfeiture of prizes by those who are self-excluded, as recommended by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         , to act as a deterrent to breaching self-exclusion agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The final part of the report looks at models of treatment for problem gambling. The committee was pleased to hear from a number of gambling treatment services across Australia who provided details of their work. It was heartening to hear about effective treatment services for those afflicted by gambling problems, including flexible models of help and treatment like online and phone counselling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Services for culturally and linguistically diverse groups are also available for problem gambling and the committee was glad to hear of the existence of targeted information resources and treatment services for people in these groups, who may already be experiencing social vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee also heard a number of suggestions from those in the gambling treatment sector about ways to improve treatment systems. For example, the need for integrated treatment services to deal with the complications of treating people with co-morbid conditions, like mental illness or drug and alcohol issues, was raised with the committee. The committee also recommends ways to embed awareness of gambling addiction across the broader health profession in order to ensure better referral pathways between health services.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report concludes with a chapter on gambling research and data collection challenges, an area where there are still serious deficiencies and gaps. The evidence base for gambling treatment services and evaluation methods are also covered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since becoming deputy chair of this committee in April 2012, I have learned a great deal about problem gambling and it is a privilege to see the tabling of the committee's third report. I want to thank the member for Denison for very capably chairing the committee and for running this inquiry very smoothly. I also want to thank the secretariat for their commitment and professionalism.
