       <p>
        Clinical trials benefit patients. Advancing medical knowledge is absolutely core to advancing care for patients and such trials are essential for that. I'm proud that my electorate of Higgins is one such place that contributes to scientific innovation and medical research. As a professor and medical researcher and having led clinical trials myself, I know how important they are not only to improving the lives of patients here in Australia but also in contributing to our leadership on the global stage. Our nation's strong economy, appetite for innovation and understanding of the importance of investment in medical research make Australia an ideal place to carry out these important human clinical trials. Each year, approximately 1,000 new clinical trials are commenced in Australia, from phase 1—first human trials—to phase 5—postmarket trials for medicines and devices.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are five key factors to make sure that Australia continues to be par excellence for clinical trials. Those favourable environments include internationally recognised standards. We are governed by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, under which all clinical trials are conducted. That level of trust in the Australian environment is very important worldwide. We've also had record-high government investment and support under our current Morrison Liberal-Nationals government. We also have, incredibly importantly, efficient regulatory processes, and they allow the pharmaceutical companies that want to undertake trials in Australia some sense of comfort. We have industry approved standard form contracts—that's very important from a business sense—and willing and informed participants. We know that there's a high level of trust from the Australian public in participating in clinical trials, and that is very helpful with ensuring that we have diverse patients participating in these clinical trials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, clinical trials are an important source of employment, training, knowledge and early access to innovative medicines so that Australian patients can access these important new therapies as they come online. In Higgins alone there are currently 75 clinical trials underway. Many patients in Higgins benefit from these trials, and I'm very proud that we've had investment by the Morrison government, with, most recently, Minister Hunt announcing $6 million to be invested in Cabrini Health, which is the only hospital in Higgins, for a new institute of cancer. That will enable us to have 180 new patients participating in trials in Higgins itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, it's our government's strong economic management that can deliver these important new health initiatives, and I'm very proud to be part of a government that is delivering.
