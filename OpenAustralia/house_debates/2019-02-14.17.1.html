       <p>
        General Hurley will be sworn in as Governor-General in June 2019. Section 3 of the Constitution prevents the Governor-General's salary from being altered during their term of office. As such, the salary must be set prior to the appointment of General Hurley as Governor-General in June 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Governor-General serves at the Queen's pleasure, it is usual to serve for approximately five years. As such, it is necessary to set the next Governor-General's salary at a level appropriate for the duration of this term.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been longstanding practice to set the Governor-General's salary by reference to that of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court. The proposed salary is based on a forecast of the Chief Justice's salary over the next five years using wages growth projections. I note that the Chief Justice's salary is determined annually by the Remuneration Tribunal, a body that is independent of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In setting an appropriate salary, the Governor-General Designate requested that regard be given to the Commonwealth funded military pension he will be entitled to receive during his term in office. This is consistent with precedent established by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Deane" rel="nofollow">

        in 1995 and continued most recently by General Cosgrove.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed salary of $495,000 per annum reflects a reduction by the amount of General Hurley's military pension.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
