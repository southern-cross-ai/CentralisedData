        I rise today to speak about the green shoots that are becoming more and more apparent in the economy and my electorate of Hindmarsh. Philmac are a global leader in the design and manufacture of specialist fittings and valves. Having been established in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        in 1929, Philmac employ over 220 people and export to 30 countries. In fact, over 40 per cent of their products are exported. They have recently announced a major expansion worth close to $10 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has supported this expansion with a $2.5 million grant. This will result in the expansion of Philmac's award-winning specialist compression fitting and valve product ranges, and ensure cost-efficient manufacturing to underpin expansion of their plumbing, mining and large-scale irrigation markets, both domestically and internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have visited Philmac a number of times, including with the employment minister, who was impressed with what he saw and heard from Philmac. I thank managing director Mark Nykiel and his skilled team for showing us their advanced manufacturing processes. I was speaking earlier this morning with the industry minister. He has visited many companies over his time as industry minister, both in the Howard government first of all and more recently in the Abbott government. He said that Philmac were a good company, so that is high praise from someone who has seen many companies around our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Philmac are not the only good news story in Hindmarsh. MIMP have grown significantly recently and have ambitious plans for further growth. MIMP Connecting Solutions are a

        owned company that specialises in the supply, installation and support of communications cabling and wireless networks. While they are always looking to expand into other areas and training their staff, they were also successful in gaining a federal government grant that has allowed them to employ an additional 40 people to carry out a project in lieu of employing overseas labour and position their company for future work valued at $8 to $10 million. This training will be recognised in interstate and international markets. I have met with their

        , Allan Aitchison, a number of times, and he impresses me greatly.

        The Treasurer recently visited the Hindmarsh electorate and also a local pastry shop in Torrensville, Kalymnos bakery. Those small businesses in Hindmarsh are big winners out of this budget. The Treasurer heard from George, who has run this family business right from the start. Over the years the whole family got in it together, and that is what small business does.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also had the Prime Minister come down to Hindmarsh. We met with Tony and Tania from Cibo at Glenelg. They run a great local business. They, like Kalymnos Pastries, will benefit from the 1.5 per cent tax cut for small businesses and the $20,000 instant asset write-off. This is a great initiative of the government that will help small businesses who are considering an expansion, like Cibo, and will encourage them to buy that extra piece of equipment instead of saving for another year. There was a great turnout to see the Prime Minister, who had a great coffee and enjoyed the visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        George, Tony, Tania and others are all winners, as are the small businesses in Hindmarsh. I look forward to working with all the businesses in my electorate to drive economic growth and create jobs for the future.
