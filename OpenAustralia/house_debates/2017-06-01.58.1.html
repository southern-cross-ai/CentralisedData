        Every question time this week we have had the government ministers come in here and talk about the magic mine that is going to create thousands of jobs. We have had one minister say it is going to create 4,000 jobs. We have had another minister say it is going to create 10,000 jobs. Another minister says it is going to create 40,000 jobs. This is just a magic mine that is going to fix the unemployment crisis of

        If only they had the same gusto and fighting spirit for the current workers in mines in Queensland. If only they could stand up for the miners in Middlemount and stand up for the miners in the small town of Tieri, which is in the seat of Flynn. These are workers who are out at the moment and whose company is going after them. If only this government stood up for these workers against their company, which is trying to bring in an agreement that will limit workers' ability to have workplace representation. This will allow the company to make any roster changes without consulting their employees and to pay workers based upon profit not hours and work. It will increase the costs of the company's accommodation for workers and limit the matters that they can determine by arbitration.

        This is what is happening right now in the mining industry. This is how mining companies are treating miners, workers and unions, like the
