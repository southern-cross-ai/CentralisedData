        Townsville’s professional dance company, dancenorth australia, received a federal funding boost last week following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        Dance Board’s announcement of its annual funding allocations. The company, which is supported largely through state and federal funding, has received a $30,000 increase in its funding for the next two years. This not only brings its annual federal funding to $210,000 per annum with an indexed increase in 2008; this also places the company back on the triennial funding cycle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Securing this funding is a testament to the hard work undertaken by everyone at dancenorth to restore the company to its rightful pre-eminent position in Australia. I am delighted that our local dance company now has the certainty it needs to produce product of world standard. Dancenorth australia, which is based in Townsville, is the pre-eminent regional dance company in the nation. My confidence in its board, management and artistic team has been vindicated by the Australia Council’s recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that artistic director Gavin Webber is ecstatic over both the increase in funding and the response from audiences in Townsville. Mr Webber told me that the increase is a great vote of confidence from federal funding bodies and that dancenorth australia is now in a strong position to continue the major national and international initiatives that have been put in place in the last 12 months. This direction could not have been taken without the fantastic support that the company gets from the community, and Gavin Webber certainly thanks everyone who has supported the company. He went on to tell me that he is sure that no-one can complain about the diversity and talent that have been on display this year at dancenorth australia. He looks forward to continuing to challenge, entertain and surprise Townsville in the coming years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising that the funding boost is great news, its general manager, Trevor Keeling, was also very pleased. He said that this not only means that the company is assured of federal funding for the next two years but is also recognition for the vigorous change in direction that has been undertaken at all levels during the last 18 months. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Most importantly, it is recognition for the exciting artistic direction that the company has steered since the appointment of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Artistic Director
        </a>
        , Gavin Webber.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Dancenorth is about to conclude its Townsville season of works with its end-of-year cabaret,
