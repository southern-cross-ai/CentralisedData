           To the member's question, as I have indicated in this parliament on more than one occasion, I am concerned about businesses that are suffering with high electricity prices, with the 50, 60 and 70 per cent we have seen flowing in various states across the nation. I am concerned about that, which is why I am driving a process for change at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
            Council of Australian Governments
           </a>
           meeting in December. I am concerned about that. I presume if the member is genuine about his question, he is concerned about that too.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the impact of carbon pricing on electricity, we have always been very clear about that and always been very clear that that is why we are providing assistance to households and why we are providing support to businesses, including support to manufacturing businesses, through the ability to work with us for cleaner energy processes, a cleaner energy way of working.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would remind the member that since the announcement of the carbon price
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

           in our nation has increased by three per cent, household consumption has increased by three per cent and new business investment has increased by 20 per cent. That is—

             <p>
              As the member well knows, as someone who stood in the 2007 election, he has been in favour of carbon pricing. Let me quote his exact words. He said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It was actually the coalition that instigated work on the emissions trading scheme. … in … a report that I helped author back in 1998 which talks about regulatory arrangements for trading in greenhouse gas emissions—1998!
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              … …   …
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The coalition’s commitment to an
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
               ETS
              </a>
              is demonstrable.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, like me, the member supports a price on carbon. The member should therefore say that in supporting a price on carbon it is important to work with businesses as they adapt to carbon pricing, and we are prepared to do so. What is not appropriate is to engage in a fear campaign not based on the facts, and it is not appropriate for the member who supports a price on carbon to come into this parliament now or to say to that business that he does not do so.
