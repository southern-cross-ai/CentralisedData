        My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Can the minister explain to the House the significance of the bombing of Darwin, which is being remembered tomorrow, and the government’s plans to commemorate this period of Australia’s war history?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. Following the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, then Labor Prime Minister John Curtin predicted the beginning of war on Australian soil. He said:

         The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia. Our honeymoon is finished.

         Four days later, war came to Australian shores with two air raids launched on Darwin. The two air raids killed more than 250 people and wounded between 300 and 400 people. Twenty military aircraft were destroyed, eight ships at anchor in the harbour were sunk, and most civil and military facilities in Darwin were devastated. The air attacks on Darwin continued until November 1943, with Darwin being attacked some 64 times. This was testament to Darwin’s pivotal role in the war effort into the islands.

         During the war other towns in

         . The battle for Australia was a struggle that encompassed a nation’s heart and soul, as Australia resisted the enemy’s attacks on its soil and territories. The threat of invasion was very real. The struggle stretched our nation’s resources to the limit. Men and women in uniform and men, women and children on the home front responded to the call. The battle for Australia comprised the bombing of Northern Australia, the

         and those battles along the Kokoda track and from Milne Bay through to Buna, Gona and Sanananda. The defence of Australia became a springboard for victory.

         for Australia Commemoration National Council was formed in 1988 to encourage annual commemoration of the battle for Australia on the first Wednesday in September each year. The date coincides with the anniversary of the

         , which proved to be the first of many Japanese land defeats in the Pacific war and a turning point in the defence of our nation.

         This government went to the electorate promising to formally recognise Battle for

          Australia Day
         </a>
         as a national day of observance—action the previous government would not take. Work is underway for the Governor-General to issue a proclamation to observe Battle for Australia Day on the first Wednesday in September each year. It will not be a public holiday or an alternative to Anzac Day or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">

         , but it will provide all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the momentous events that helped shape our nation and to remember those who lost their lives to protect our freedom and way of life.
