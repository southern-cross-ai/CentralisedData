        It is with great honour that I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">
         MG
        </a>
        on the occasion of his posthumous award of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        for most conspicuous acts of valour, extreme devotion to duty and ultimate self-sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an honour to attend the ceremony at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
         CDF
        </a>
        salute Corporal Baird's parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the second time I have paid tribute to Corporal Baird in this place. When I spoke last year following Corporal Baird's death I said that he was an outstanding special forces soldier. He exemplified what it meant to be a commando, living by the attributes of uncompromising spirit and honour, which, in turn, earned him the unconditional respect of his fellow commandos.
       </p>
       <p>
        His leadership in action was exemplary, constantly inspiring those around him to achieve greater things. He was an extremely dedicated and disciplined soldier and that is saying something for this group of people. If anyone knows that group of people they will know that they are extraordinary individuals and extraordinary warriors. For him to shine amongst that group, he must have been an incredibly extraordinary individual. These commandos are extremely dedicated and disciplined. So for those qualities to be highlighted demonstrates that he was an exceptional man, always striving for excellence in everything he did.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time of his death we did not know much about Corporal Baird because, due to the nature of the commandos, the aspects of their work, their actions must not be disclosed. But we have learnt much more about him since that time, both about his personal qualities and his actions in service. Everything that we have learnt has further demonstrated that Corporal Baird was an exemplary leader who showed the utmost dedication and courage and, above all, humility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many times before in this place I have spoken about the special bond that exists within commando regiments. When a soldier joins the commandos he and his family are commandos for life. Commandos are more like a brotherhood than any other regiment I know. So when one of their fellow commandos dies in action it is just like losing a brother. Today I would like to pass on my sympathies and condolences to the 2nd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Commando Regiment
        </a>
        . I know that you have lost a brother and I also know that Corporal Baird's family will take comfort from the ongoing support they will receive from you and from the love and respect that you have shown their son. They were out in full force at the Governor-General's event this month. It was wonderful to see them bonding with the family, supporting the family and surrounding the family with support, love and compassion. The citation for Corporal Baird's VC reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Corporal Baird's acts of valour and self-sacrifice … preserved the lives of his team members. His actions were of the highest order and in keeping with the finest traditions of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        My deepest sympathies and respect go to Corporal Baird's parents, his brother, his extended family and friends, and his fellow commandos. Australia will never forget your sacrifice. Corporal Baird is truly deserving of this great honour.

        </small>
        <p>
         On 24 June last year I joined the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence to honour a fallen commando, Corporal Cameron Baird, then
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">
          MG
         </a>
         , now VC, MG, who was tragically killed two days earlier whilst fighting with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. He was then the 20th member of the Special Operations Task Group to fall in combat, an example of the price paid by some of our elite soldiers, a disproportionate price—half of our combat deaths—being paid by our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF" rel="nofollow">
          SF
         </a>
         elements. Of those 20 souls that have fallen in special forces, 10 were patrol commanders. Half of our special forces killed in action were the men who commanded from the front. Such was Corporal Baird.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two days before I gave that speech, on 22 June, Corporal Baird led his men into battle as a patrol commander. He would lose his life in extraordinary close combat with a highly trained and determined enemy. He repeatedly drew fire away from team members and charged enemy fire five times through a building. His actions enabled the enemy to be neutralised and his team survived—mission successful. He was awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         in recognition of exceptional and conspicuous act of valour, extreme devotion to duty and ultimately self-sacrifice. The Victoria Cross for valour is appropriate in this regard. To charge a door where you know there is a sustained enemy force behind that is resisting every element, to charge once is bloody gutsy; to charge it twice is a serious act of courage and leadership at a command level; to keep going back, in this case five times, until the enemy is done with is nothing short of extraordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
         I used on 24 June 2013 an analogy from the Spartans. Heroditus tells us the Spartans never asked how many of the enemy there were, they simply asked where they were. I said it then and I reflect upon it now: Corporal Baird did not know how many enemy he faced that night. The fire was sustained, direct and accurate. The enemy was courageous and resilient and was not prepared to give in. He did not know how many, all he knew was where they were, and that is where he went. That is, frankly, the stuff of legend, highly deserving of the Victoria Cross. I pay tribute to this extraordinary man.
        </p>
        <p>
         I acknowledge his father, Doug, his mother, Kaye, and his brother, Brendan Baird. They have lost a son, they have lost a brother. They have lost him in extraordinary circumstances but they have lost him still. We share their grief while at the same time acknowledging his heroism. The Baird family said they are extremely proud of Cameron. They were honoured to accept the VC on his behalf and were grateful to the Governor-General and the ADF for bestowing this honour upon Cameron—gracious words from a grieving family honouring a lost son.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cameron joined the Army in January 2000. He served for 13 years. Oddly enough, he discharged in 2004 and rejoined in 2006, both periods assigned to the 4th Battalion, now the 2nd
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Commando Regiment
         </a>
         . His operational service included Operations Tanager, Falconer and Bastille and five tours on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Slipper
         </a>
         . He was previously awarded the Medal of Gallantry as a lance corporal for his actions during close combat in Afghanistan in November 2007, then leading his team forward under heavy fire to recover a wounded comrade. Many acts of bravery occur on battlefields. The interesting thing about Corporal Baird is that he knew what faced him. He had faced fire many times. He had led his team forward previously in extraordinary circumstances in November 2007. He knew what fire sounded like. He knew the crack-thump of incoming rounds. Yet on that fateful day, 22 June, he went forward again. It was an extraordinary act.
        </p>
        <p>
         In acknowledging Corporal Baird's gallantry and his sacrifice of his life let me also acknowledge the men and women of the 2nd Commando Regiment. Their list of battle honours—the men and women who have won both individual honour and of course the Eastern Shah Wali Kot Battle Honour for the regiment—speaks volumes about their training, their tenacity and their courage. We are lucky to have had such fine men and women serve us in the ADF. I am especially pleased to see that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
          Joel Fitzgibbon
         </a>
         , the member for Hunter, a former defence minister in this place is here to speak on this. I welcome his comments and his commitment. He was a Minister for Defence while we were at war, which brings with it a special responsibility and is something that I know bears heavily on his shoulders and that he took seriously when he was defence minister at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Baird's VC is the 100th that our nation has given out. It is an award given rarely, because rarely do we find such enormous acts of heroism that are worthy of such an honour. Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC, MG is deserving of that. He has paid an extraordinary price for an extraordinary act of gallantry for the nation, for mates and for units. It is a proud day on which I as Assistant Minister for Defence can speak in this place to acknowledge such a great Australian. I know the nation is proud of him. This parliament is proud of him. The government is proud of him.

         <p>
          I thank very sincerely the Assistant Minister for Defence for his comments. He is right: serving as the Minister for Defence of this country is a great honour and privilege but it brings with it a very heavy weight of responsibility, none greater than knowing that you have responsibility for those who serve in overseas operations and in such dangerous circumstances. It has been my very deliberate habit always to speak to motions such as this, usually in sadness, immediately following the death of a soldier, but on this occasion in recognition of the bestowal of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria Cross
          </a>
          on Corporal Cameron Baird.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not intend to go through Corporal Baird's honours and awards, because that has all been done. However, I do associate myself with the words of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence, the Assistant Minister for Defence and all those who have spoken to this motion—indeed, the whole parliament, which by resolution has recognised Corporal Baird's bravery and commitment to his country.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not know whether I knew Cameron Baird. I may have; I may have met him during my time as defence minister. I have said in this place before that while I am not sure I knew him I knew what he was—in a sense, I knew who he was. There is an amazing common thread that runs through all of our special forces soldiers, but this time I can say it more confidently, because I spoke at length with his parents on the day that it was announced in the parliament that he would be the next recipient of the Victoria Cross. In that discussion it was confirmed that everything I was thinking about who and what Cameron Baird was was absolutely correct. I learnt and had confirmed that he wanted to be doing what he was doing; he absolutely believed in what he was doing—not only the cause but the way in which we are conducting the operations; and of course he understood the risks very well, as you would expect someone who was doing their fifth tour of Afghanistan would.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is an important point. These young men who serve in our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces" rel="nofollow">
           Special Forces
          </a>
          do so voluntarily, do so enthusiastically, do so really believing in the cause and their mission, and do so understanding the risks absolutely. Notwithstanding that, they do that work with great dedication, energy and enthusiasm and with the greatest of skill. One cannot help but be superimpressed by the skills and talents of the young men who serve in the Special Forces.
         </p>
         <p>
          Cameron Baird was on his fifth tour. His parents told me that he had been out of the Army for some time. Many who leave cannot live in that outside world, and he was drawn back into the service. Of course, as we know now, five tours was one too many. I encourage any Australian who might be conscious of this discussion happening today to have a look at the citation of Cameron Baird. As the assistant minister said, what he did was nothing short of amazing. That is true of course of every one of the 100 recipients of the Victoria Cross. I found Mark Donaldson's citation amazing; I found
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
           Ben Roberts
          </a>
          -Smith's citation amazing. These people really have demonstrated that they have no fear and that there is no limit to their commitment to their country. We salute them all.
         </p>
         <p>
          I again extend my sympathies to Cameron's parents and his brother Brendan, and to all those he loved and who loved him. I knew him in a sense by knowing what he was, but I think we can all lament the fact we did not know him well. He was obviously a very special Australian, and that is official now that he has been awarded the Victoria Cross. With everyone else who has made a contribution to this debate, I salute him.

            Victoria Cross
           </a>

            Commando Regiment
           </a>
           . The Victoria Cross is our pre-eminent award for valour, a quality demonstrated time and time again by this fine young soldier. Corporal Baird has posthumously become the 100th soldier to be bestowed with the Victoria Cross. In Australia the Victoria Cross was established in 1991. The late Corporal Baird has become the fourth recipient from the Afghanistan campaign and the first to be awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia in that campaign posthumously.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cameron Baird was born in Burnie, Tasmania, in 1981. He was an athletic young man and an outstanding sportsman. He joined the Army in January 2000, at the age of 18. On completion of his initial training, he was assigned to 4th Battalion (Commando), The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Australian Regiment
           </a>
           , now the 2nd Commando Regiment. He briefly left the armed services in 2004, returning to the 2nd Commando Regiment in 2006, where he quickly displayed leadership skills. Corporal Baird was deployed seven times, including on operations in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_L'Este" rel="nofollow">
            Timor L'Este
           </a>
           , Afghanistan and Iraq. In February 2007 he deployed on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
            Operation Slipper
           </a>
           in Afghanistan, where he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during a clearance of a Taliban stronghold. In November 2007, under heavy fire and with complete disregard for his personal safety, he led other team members to recover a wounded soldier. He killed several combatants and undoubtedly prevented further casualties through his actions.
          </p>
          <p>
           His final deployment was also to Afghanistan, this time with the Special Operations Task Group, in February 2013. On 22 June 2013 he was killed in action by small-arms fire whilst engaged with insurgents in Oruzgan province. His final encounter with the enemy demonstrated the qualities that made him not only a great soldier but a great human being. His heroic efforts to repeatedly draw fire away from his fellow commandos and charge enemy positions exemplify the most courageous of acts. Not once but three times he regained the initiative and saved his team members' lives. With bullets firing around him, and at one stage even having to seek cover because of a jammed rifle, his actions were both valiant and selfless.
          </p>
          <p>
           He has been described by his comrades as 'one of the most iconic figures' in the regiment. This is high praise indeed from members of a distinguished unit—one which has suffered more casualties in Afghanistan than any other Australian unit.
          </p>
          <p>
           His personal humility, leadership and concern for his fellow soldiers uphold the finest traditions of the

            Australian Defence Force

           . He is undoubtedly a most worthy recipient of our highest decoration for conspicuous acts of valour and is an inspiration to us all.
          </p>
          <p>
           Corporal Baird has left behind his parents, Doug and Kaye; his brother, Brendan; and his nephews, Max and Riley; and I extend to them the sympathies of the electorate of

           . We grieve their loss, knowing that their much loved family member has made the ultimate sacrifice to protect his nation and its values. We know, however, that their grief and sadness will also be mixed with a sense of pride in their son's character and his achievements.
          </p>

           When the Baird family were presented with Corporal Baird's Victoria Cross medal at

            Government House
           </a>
           in Canberra on Tuesday, 18 February, it was an occasion that not only honoured who he was but what he believed in and fought for. The ceremony also paid tribute to Corporal Baird's brothers-in-arms, the 2nd Commando Regiment. Corporal Baird was a true hero, albeit a humble one. He held steadfast when most people would falter. We can all aspire to his examples of courage, mateship and loyalty. For his bravery and selflessness, Australia will be forever thankful. Corporal Baird will forever hold a special place in Australian history and the hearts of our people. We will always be grateful to him and we will always remember him. Lest we forget.

            I am honoured to speak about our 100th VC winner and the fourth from the Afghanistan Campaign and, sadly, our 40th combat death in Afghanistan. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that three other brave men have been awarded the VC in Afghanistan. Corporal

             Victoria Cross
            </a>
            for Australia on 16 January 2009, and was the first Australian in almost 40 years to receive the nation's highest military honour. Corporal

            , became the second recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia. Corporal Daniel Keighran VC received his award on 1 November 2012. And now Corporal Cameron Baird VC, MG, is the fourth recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia and the first to be awarded posthumously.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have reflected on the citation for Corporal Baird and his medal. It tells us that Corporal Baird enlisted in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Regular_Army" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Regular Army
            </a>
            in 2000, was discharged in 2004 and re-enlisted in 2006. In both periods of service he was assigned to the 4th Battalion
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Australian Regiment
            </a>
            (Commando). His operational service includes Operations Tanager, Falconer and Bastille, and five tours on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
             Operation Slipper
            </a>
            . He was awarded our second-highest in the order of awards, the medal for gallantry, for his service in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we know about this man from this citation is his bravery, his commitment, his courage and his intelligence. I never met Corporal Baird, sadly, but have been greatly privileged to meet many of his fellow commandos. I visited Tarin Kot on a number of occasions and visited men in the field, and there is no doubt that Afghanistan has been an awful and very difficult campaign. As a result, we now know, at the end of our time there, that 40 Australians have lost their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            This citation is extraordinary. Whilst I could read it in total, I am sure many would have read it in any event. Corporal Baird charged an enemy compound three times—not once, not twice but three times. That is how they ended up getting him—because his commitment to his team pushed him on. Words cannot really do true justice to the service of Corporal Baird or, indeed, his comrades. As the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
             CDF
            </a>
            recently said, there is not enough recognition really given to those who have worn our uniform on our behalf in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I have had cause to say on previous occasions in this place, those of us who have never worn the uniform in battle, those of us who have never been fortunate enough to serve this country because we made different choices, should stand in awe of those who do—no matter what they do. Whether it is working, as Corporal Baird did, as a commando, as part of our special forces, someone working on a patrol boat doing border protection work or someone flying one of our wonderful aircraft in our
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
             RAAF
            </a>
            , these people do wonderful work for us which too often goes unheralded. I think the CDF was correct to point to us our obligation to pay greater tribute to those who wear the uniform on our behalf.
           </p>
           <p>
            For my own part, I have had the great privilege of being a minister in the defence portfolio for five years. It has given me an opportunity to meet with many of these brave men and women and to learn about and understand this commitment that so many brave Australian men and women make. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, being a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I was also a minister for veterans' affairs and that gave me the opportunity meet so many, many people who have done great service for this country. We have an obligation to them. Today we have an opportunity to pay homage to Corporal Baird and, through that homage, to say thank you to all of those men and women in uniform who serve us. I am reminded of the Soldiers Code, which I think sums up well Corporal Baird. It says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I have the honour to be a Soldier in the

           </p>
           <p>
            We can say to Corporal Baird: you epitomised every element of that code. The Soldiers Code sums up you to a tee, as it does for so many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is trite for us to stand here and say how difficult it must be for Corporal Baird's family, but they should know that this nation is so grateful for his courage and his sacrifice. Corporal Baird, God bless you and thank you.

             Words, however heartfelt, are never enough to replace what Corporal Cameron Baird's family have lost. But I must say I know how heartfelt are the words of the member for Lingiari, the former veterans affairs minister. The member for Lingiari is a hard man but I know he was choked with emotion at the end of that very eloquent speech. I have not seen that before, and I pay him great credit for his very emotional words. He knows what men and women in uniform do for our nation, for our nation's spirit and for the Anzac spirit which lives on. I can only endorse the very eloquent words of the member for Lingiari. Well done.
            </p>
            <p>
             The member for Lingiari said, 'God bless you,' to Corporal Baird at the end of his speech. That is so important. I know that Senator Barnaby Joyce finishes most of his speeches with, 'God bless you.' It is an antiquated, Christian phrase, but it means so much. As a nation and as a people, we say, 'God bless you,' to Corporal Baird, who gave his life for his mates and for a just cause—a righteous cause.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before I came to this place I never really thought about the fact that the people who wear our military uniform—they wear it so well!—voluntarily go off to war. They want to do that. They serve with great pride and distinction, but they do it because they want to. Before I entered parliament I did not realise how much of a heavy heart I would have when I learned of each and every one of those 40 deaths. Of course it meant a lot to me. It means so much more to me as a parliamentarian because it is the parliament which enacts the legislation that sends those young men and women off to do battle on behalf of our nation and on behalf of a cause. I learned of each and every one of the 40 deaths in Afghanistan with such a heavy heart.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that view of those deaths is shared across parliament. This is not a partisan thing. This is not a political thing. We are all Australians in this parliament; we all want our men and women who go off to serve our nation, to come home. Godspeed them home. Thankfully, they are coming home from Afghanistan. Their duty is done in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a far better place now than the one which our troops—our brave men and women—first entered. It is a far better place. It has taken a heavy toll. We have lost 40 of our bravest young men—our best and our brightest: heroes, all. We can only say, as a nation, 'Thanks.' But words are never enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 13 February the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others, made fine speeches at the announcement of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
              Victoria Cross
             </a>
             for Australia award of valour for Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">
              MG
             </a>
             . When the announcement of the VC was made, many parliamentarians from both sides lined up and passed on their condolences to the family of Corporal Baird. I will never forget his mother. She was not shedding tears. She was so stoic. It is hard to find words to say to a mother who has lost a son in such tragic but extraordinary circumstances, a son who gave his life—paid the ultimate sacrifice—on behalf of his nation. What can you say to a mother who has lost her boy but, 'Thanks; I am sorry.' She said, 'No, no; this is recognition for all his mates. He would have wanted this recognition for his mates. He would have wanted it to be shared with his mates.' No individualism; that is the Army way. It is: do it for the team. Do it for the unit, the regiment, the Army as a whole, but most of all do it for your mates.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is hard to grasp that concept of self-sacrifice but our men and women have been doing it since the first men from these colonies went to the Sudan in 1885. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War" rel="nofollow">
              Boer War
             </a>
             was the first war in which the Victoria Cross was awarded to Australians. Now it is the Victoria Cross for Australia but back then it was the VC. Sixty-four VCs were awarded in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">

             , two of which went to people from the Riverina who could proudly call the Riverina home. There were others with connections to my region but there were two in particular who were born and bred in the Riverina.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
              William Jackson
             </a>
             from Gunbar, between Hay and Carrathool, was and still is the youngest ever VC recipient. He was 18 years young when he received his Victoria Cross for bravery in France, on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
              Western Front
             </a>
             . He was also the first recipient of a VC in action on the Western Front. Like Cameron Baird, he went out again and again to help his mates, to look for others who were wounded, to repel the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some time later, William Jackson was helping Sergeant Hugh Camden to bring in mortally wounded Private Alfred Robinson when he was hit by an exploding shell. Jackson said the he didn't feel much, just a numbing sensation, but he had actually lost his right arm. His right arm was just hanging like a limp thread. Sergeant Camden, from Moree, told a local reception for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
              Billy Jackson
             </a>
             later, 'Bill had gone out looking without his arm. Not looking for a VC but for a cobber.' That is what I am sure Corporal Baird also did—not looking for any accolades or awards, certainly not a VC. He just went there to do what he was trained for: to do his best for his mates. Another VC recipient from Tumut was

             . He enlisted on 4 January 2000 and did his initial training with many of his mates at Kapooka. Each time there has been a casualty, let alone a loss of life, in combat for Australia, it has been with a heavy heart that I have always stood in the parliament and talk of that loss, because so many of those brave young souls did their initial training at Wagga Wagga. Wagga Wagga is a tri-service city. It is unique for an inland regional city to be a tri-service city.

            <p>
             As I said, Corporal Baird's mother, Kaye, is very proud of her son, as she should be. His Victoria Cross award is for most conspicuous act of valour, extreme devotion to duty and ultimate self-sacrifice at a village in

              I join other members of this House in honouring Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird as the 100th recipient of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
               Victoria Cross
              </a>
              . Corporal Baird, as other speakers have already pointed out, was killed on 22 June 2013 whilst on duty in Afghanistan. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Much has been said about Corporal Baird both at the time of his death and more so in recent days in response to him having been awarded the Victoria Cross.
             </p>
             <p>
              I did not personally know Corporal Baird, but the comments that I have read and heard about him from those who did know him and the comments contained in the award citation leave no doubt in my mind that he was a very worthy recipient of the Victoria Cross, an award given to very few people—in fact, 100 people in the history of our nation. From looking over his previous awards and his military service, including operations in Timor-Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, my view is that Corporal Baird had, prior to his death, displayed all of the virtues for which the Victoria Cross is awarded.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, as others have also said, words will not bring back Corporal Baird or ease the loss to his parents, Doug and Kaye; to his brother, Brendan; or to his Defence mates, some of whom perhaps owe their own lives to him and to whom I offer my personal condolences. I can only imagine how they must be feeling right now. But the award, however, may ease the grief in the knowledge that Corporal Baird's actions made a difference to the lives of others and that, in his giving his life for his country, his country has in turn acknowledged him by awarding him the highest possible military honour.
             </p>
             <p>
              As Australia's participation in the Afghanistan war draws to an end, historians and military analysts will offer their views on the war. Sadly, for those 40 from Australia who lost their lives in Afghanistan, for the many others from all the other countries who in one way or another participated and for those who remain physically or mentally injured—and for their families—regardless of which country they came from or whom they fought for, the Afghanistan war is another reminder of the terrible social and economic costs of war. It is a cost that I see all too frequently when I look into the faces of and speak with war veterans and their family members.

              I represent an electorate that is adjacent to the Edinburgh Defence base. Over my years in public life, I have had cause to associate with just about all of the Defence groups in the area, including the National Servicemen's Association members, the Vietnam vets, members of the Defence Force who have served in Afghanistan on several occasions, members who served in World War
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

              and members who served in the Pacific region in the 1950s and 1960s. The member for Lingiari quite rightly pointed out that not enough recognition is given to those who have served our country, and it is on that point that I want to make some additional remarks.
             </p>
             <p>
              February was a month where I attended, every week, different military commemoration services in one place or another. On Wednesday last week, I attended a service at the Salisbury
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
               RSL
              </a>
              commemorating the bombing of Darwin. It has become an annual service at the Salisbury RSL. It is one of those events about which I do not believe that we as a nation give enough recognition and acknowledgement to those people who were subject to those attacks.
             </p>
             <p>
              To summarise those attacks: between 19 February 1942 and November 1943, Darwin, Broome, Wyndham,

               Port Hedland

               Horn Island
              </a>
              were all attacked by Japanese aircraft. The first and most destructive of those attacks was that on Darwin on 19 February 1942. Although the precise numbers will never be known, it is estimated that around 250 people, both civilian and Defence personnel, were killed and hundreds more were injured. In service I attended,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Ward" rel="nofollow">
               Pam Ward
              </a>
              read a letter that her husband had written to her from Darwin immediately after the attacks. Her husband Fred was a soldier based at Darwin and was there throughout the air raids. He was lucky because he survived. The sense of fear and helplessness and the devastation that took place are difficult for anyone who was not there to imagine. Hearing the words from a person who experienced it all brings home the terrifying ordeal for people there at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              The service enabled all of us to remember the people of Darwin and other places in Australia who were subjected to the attacks over that 18 month period. It also enables us to think about the futile loss of innocent lives and the destruction that took place between February 1942 and November 1943. Like all other past wars, the attacks on Darwin in northern Australia are sad reminders of the senseless cruelty and carnage of wars, but they are equally reminders of the people who serve this country and how they put their lives on the line in doing so.
             </p>
             <p>
              A week later I joined the Para sub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association in their annual commemoration service at Salisbury, marking National Servicemen's Association Day. As a friend and a long-time supporter of the sub-branch, I frequently attend National Servicemen's Association events and I have made many personal friends from among them over the years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Between 1951 and 1972, around 300,000 or thereabouts young Australians were called up for national service with some called up through a ballot system, particularly those who were called up during the Vietnam war period. Quite a number of them were involved in active service in places like Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. I understand that a considerable number of them voluntarily enlisted in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Defence Force
              </a>
              s when the national service period had ended. Of course, they are all now into their retirement years and many of them have even passed away. The friendship and bonds that were established in the course of this service have, however, endured. It is often the mateship that helped them cope with the struggle and tough times that so many of them confronted with from time to time. I have to say they are a great bunch of guys and they have a terrific sense of humour. It is that mateship point that I simply want to focus on for a moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Corporal Baird gave his life for his mates. If ever you want to understand what it means to be a true mate, look no further than Corporal Baird. In my view it is the extreme sense of true mateship when you are prepared to go that far, and he was. It is because he did that that he was awarded the Victoria Cross. I suspect that there are many other people who have served in our Defence Forces who equally put their lives on the line, not only for our country but for their mates. Regrettably, for one reason or another, they will never be given the recognition that Corporal Baird has received, but that in no way diminishes their commitment to our country and to their mates. Corporal Baird, however, will be recognised, and has been recognised, in a deserved way for what he did for his country and his mates. His family and his friends at least know that the country has recognised him with this award and in doing so, I believe, it is the most appropriate way to show our respects and appreciation for him. May he rest in peace.

               Sitting here in the chamber for the last hour, I have heard some of the most exceptional tributes to Corporal Cameron Baird, and I would like to thank you for the tributes just made. On behalf of my community of Lindsay, we are a proud military community and I am privileged today to rise to pay tribute to Corporal Cameron Baird VC,

              </p>
              <p>
               The Victoria Cross has long been a distinguished part of Australian military history and it is our highest military award. To Corporal Baird's family, Doug and Kay, as well as the entire family, I express my sincere condolences and gratitude for the son you have lost. You must be so proud of your son, such an amazing young man, who has been taken away from you way too soon. Like the 40 other Australians who have lost their loved ones in Afghanistan, you now feel the bittersweet pain of the loss and the hole in your lives this gives, within the pride of what they have achieved and done in service to our nation.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would like to echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister at the ceremony on 18 February, and I quote:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               What can we say but this—greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friend.
              </p>
              <p>
               We will always draw strength from his actions for we are a nation of memory, not just memorials. His name will live forever. As members have already noted this medal is a:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … decoration for according recognition to persons who in the presence of the enemy, perform acts of the most conspicuous gallantry, or daring or pre-eminent acts of valour or self-sacrifice or display extreme devotion to duty.
              </p>
              <p>
               In reflecting on these qualities, it is only fitting that Corporal Cameron Baird receive the Victoria Cross for Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Corporal Baird made five special forces tours with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Defence Force
               </a>

                East Timor
               </a>
               , Iraq and Afghanistan. On the night of 22 June 2013, whilst serving in Afghanistan, Corporal Baird made the ultimate sacrifice. Corporal Baird charged the enemy line, the compound, three times. He repeatedly and fatally drew enemy fire away from his team members and charged the enemy positions. That was the act of a truly brave and noble soldier and an act of valour.
              </p>
              <p>
               In short, Corporal Baird was an outstanding leader of men. We have heard this in detail today by many speakers. He put love of his country before himself but, greater than that, love of his mates. He is the embodiment of the Anzac spirit and that of the Australian soldier. The final line of the Australian soldier's code states:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               At all times I act in ways that will bring honour to Australia, and credit upon the Army, my unit and my fellow soldiers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Corporal Baird: you most definitely achieved that. You have in every way been an ultimate soldier and right to the very last moment you have most definitely embodied the Anzac code.
              </p>
              <p>
               In receiving the Victoria Cross, the bravery of Corporal Baird will be remembered and instilled in Australia's military history. On behalf of the Lindsay community and which I represent: we express our deepest sympathy to your family, your mates and your regiment. As a nation we will be forever in your debt and grateful for your bravery and sacrifice. We will remember you. Lest we forget.

                I rise today on behalf of the people of my electorate of Ryan, to join with my colleagues to highlight the heroism of one young Australian: the late Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird. The Ryan electorate is home to

                 Gallipoli Barracks

                . I note that this award and the bravery and sacrifice it recognises is of particular significance not only to the serving men and women of Gallipoli Barracks and to the veterans and defence families living within Ryan but also to the whole community.
               </p>
               <p>
                Corporal Baird is the 100th Australian to receive the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
                 Victoria Cross
                </a>
                , our highest military honour. The Victoria Cross, hand-fashioned from the metal from Russian guns captured at Sebastopol during the Crimean war, from 1854 to 1856, has been awarded posthumously to Corporal Baird in recognition of his remarkable bravery. Displays of courage, loyalty, duty, endurance, initiative, sacrifice, humility, discipline and mateship; behind every award of a Victoria Cross is a remarkable story involving all these qualities which Australians hold dear as part of what has become known as the Anzac spirit.
               </p>
               <p>
                I spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Todd Vail when he was in my office as part of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Defence Force
                </a>
                Parliamentary Program last year. Todd has undertaken many overseas deployments, including to Afghanistan. I asked Todd for his thoughts, to try and understand, even in a small way, how it feels to lose a comrade. This is what he said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The first notification usually strikes you to the core. I was at home at the time and found out through friends who had heard it on the news. Everyone who you meet or talk to will ask questions about who it was and the circumstances in which it occurred. Expecting you as a member of the Defence Force to have all the answers. However, you know no details due to the blanket media ban, which is not lifted until the next of kin have been notified and approved the release of the name. During this time you speculate along with everyone else. Being a member of the ADF you do wonder if you knew him-particularly as the media said he was in a leadership role.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The news brings a sense of reality which hits home. You realise that the profession you have chosen can be deadly. You think of his family and what they must be going through. It makes you think of your own family and you put yourself in their shoes and wonder how they would cope. You also think of the injured and hope their injuries will not leave them maimed with little quality of life.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Having spent time in Afghanistan you can visualise the incident, your senses are alert to the sights, sounds and smell of the afghan countryside, they play over and over again in your mind on a never ending loop.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                In the end you reconcile your feelings by knowing he died doing what he loved, surrounded by his mates.
               </p>
               <p>
                When Queen Victoria created the Victoria Cross in 1856, after the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War" rel="nofollow">
                 Crimean War
                </a>
                , she had it be inscribed with the words 'For Valour'. Valour: the perfect word to describe Corporal Baird's actions. On 22 June 2013 Corporal Baird displayed conspicuous valour, leading to his ultimate sacrifice in close combat with a determined enemy, as a commando team leader in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruzgan_Province" rel="nofollow">
                 Uruzgan Province
                </a>
                , Afghanistan. He repeatedly drew enemy fire away from his team members and charged enemy positions under heavy fire. His actions enabled the enemy to be neutralised and his team kept safe.
               </p>
               <p>
                We must never forget that we as a nation send young men and women to war and that they fight on our behalf with honour and courage. Corporal Baird was an outstanding special forces soldier. He exemplified what it meant to be a commando, living by the attributes of uncompromising spirit and honour—truly in keeping with the finest traditions of the Australian Defence Force. Corporal Baird's commitment to his chosen career as a soldier and to our mission in Afghanistan was unwavering and his leadership in action was exemplary, consistently inspiring those around him to strive for more. We must not let the loss of his life be in vain. His bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten. Lest we forget.

                 . Reading the citation and the story about the air-mobile assault on Ghawchak village in Uruzgan province really does bring home the extraordinary efforts of our soldiers in Afghanistan. Not only is this in many ways a typical, or classical, fight in these sorts of operations, you can visualise the fog of war in it as well—the confusion that reigns and the uncertainty of the circumstances.

                 When you travel in that part of the world you often see these compounds—pretty much small forts—that dot the region. When intelligence shows that the Taliban are holed up there and they are in prepared positions within that compound, it is a very difficult circumstance—there is no doubt about it. This is clear when you read through the citation and hear exactly what took place: assault going on; one team gets held up; Corporal Baird's team then moves to provide support there; then they come under attack from the flank, to the side, and on and on it goes like this; and then Corporal Baird, as a great commander, a great leader—although a corporal, still a great leader of men—takes command and moves his forces and leads from the front, in the very finest traditions of the

                 When we look back through history, we see that this country is in many ways defined by what took place at Gallipoli. Indeed, Anzac Day is probably the one day of the year that is closest to being a holy day for us; more so than even
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
                  Australia Day
                 </a>
                 really is. It is a day when this country was defined. The landings at Gallipoli helped define this country and defined us as a people. Again and again throughout history since then, our soldiers, sailors and airmen have helped redefine the nature of our country—things that we can be exceptionally proud of. Afghanistan was a good cause and people have been greatly helped by our efforts there. The mortality rates for children have been reduced. Access for women and girls to education has been dramatically improved. In many ways, it is a far better country, and that is because of the efforts of our soldiers. Particularly when we have someone like Corporal Baird showing the finest traditions of our country through bravery it is a great Australian story. I pay tribute to and salute Corporal Baird for his efforts. It is such a tragedy it came with the loss of his life but, whether it was the Medal of Gallantry or the Victoria Cross, Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC, MG has really defined himself as a great Australian and he will be remembered for ever more.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would also like to raise an interesting point regarding the date of Corporal Baird's death. The day that they moved into that fight was 22 June. I looked back through my diary to that date—I think it is wise to put these things into perspective—and found that on 22 June I was at events at a couple of local shopping centres. In my view I was doing important things—campaigning for the forthcoming federal election. It really put it into perspective for me: I was at a shopping centre chatting with people and, at that very time, Australian soldiers were out there putting their lives on the line. As I have said in previous speeches when we have lost some of our soldiers in this war, it really does put it in perspective that, whilst we are in places where there is no threat whatsoever, out there in the world Australian soldiers are putting their lives on the line not only for this country but also for a better future for those countries that they are actually fighting in. So it is very easy to salute Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC, MG—a great Australian doing great work for the good things in this world.
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God" rel="nofollow">
                  Thank God
                 </a>
                 that we have Australian soldiers who are prepared to do that—that people are prepared to put the uniform on—for that better world. Thank God we have people of such fine character and outstanding courage in this world. Again, I salute Corporal Cameron Baird—a great Australian.

                  </a>
                  . The citation goes on to record the events surrounding Corporal Baird's actions and ultimately his death in the typical understatement and lack of pathos that has come to typify the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                   Australian Defence Force
                  </a>
                  's attitude toward the bestowing of an honour upon itself. Nonetheless, the understatement is harrowing in its description of the events that took place on 22 June 2013 at Gorchuk village, Uruzgan province, Afghanistan. I would like now to read part of the citation:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  With complete disregard for his own safety, Corporal Baird charged towards enemy positions, supported by his team. On nearing the positions he and his team were engaged by additional enemy on their flank. Instinctively Corporal Baird neutralised the new threat with grenades and rifle fire, enabling his team to close with the prepared position. With the prepared position now isolated, Corporal Baird manoeuvred and was engaged by enemy machine gun fire, the bullets striking the ground around him. Displaying great valour, he drew the fire, moved to cover and suppressed the enemy machine gun position. This action enabled his team to close on the entrance prepared positions, thus regaining the initiative.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  While pathos is found wanting in this description of the battle, it certainly evokes images of selfless service, courage and loyalty to one's mates. As a man who has never served Australia in the military, I am filled with an immense sense of pride and thankfulness in all serving and past members of the defence forces, including Corporal Baird, when I read descriptions of battles like this one.

                  It is a special honour today to be able to speak to this statement because Corporal Baird was born in my home town, Burnie, in the midst of my electorate, Braddon. He was born in 1981. He ultimately moved to

                  . Despite Corporal Baird's young age at the time of his death, he was an experienced soldier, having been deployed on no less than seven tours, including to Timor-Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan . On a previous tour to Afghanistan Corporal Baird was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for 'gallantry in action during close-quarters combat'. So it is quite clear to me that Corporal Baird's actions, though courageous, were not unique to the events on 22 June 2013, rather they typified his action and attitude toward serving his country.

                  in honour of Corporal Baird I had the opportunity and the honour to meet Corporal Baird's parents. I spoke to Mr Doug Baird, his father, on the floor of the parliament on that morning. Mr Baird expressed his desire to visit his son's birthplace, which, as I said, is in the electorate of Braddon. He wanted to go back to the place in which his son was born. So as one of those elected representatives for Burnie I would like to say to Mr Baird that we would be honoured to receive him, be it publicly or without mention. He and his wife, Kaye, and Cameron's brother, Brendan, are very welcome.

                  In closing, I want to read the closing of Corporal Baird's Victoria Cross citation, as I believe it summarises the words spoken both in the main chamber of the parliament and here in the Federation Chamber. It reads:

                 <p class="italic">
                  Corporal Baird’s acts of valour and self-sacrifice regained the initiative and preserved the lives of his team members. His actions were of the highest order and in keeping with the finest traditions of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.

                   The date of 22 June 2013 will forever be etched in our nation's military history. It was the day Corporal Cameron Baird
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">

                   became the 40th Australian casualty to fall in Afghanistan. But it was his brave and noble actions on that fateful day that would see Corporal Baird posthumously awarded the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
                    Victoria Cross
                   </a>
                   , our nation's highest award for gallantry, which was presented to his parents on Tuesday last week. By fate, Corporal Baird has been elevated as our 100 recipient of this most prestigious honour. But elevation was not something this soldier sought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In 2007 Corporal Baird was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for displaying complete disregard for his own safety when he led his team forward under heavy enemy fire to recover a mortally wounded team member. Corporal Baird, of Holsworthy's own 2nd

                   commando in every sense. He was disciplined, he was physically and mentally tough, he was a man dedicated to those around him. He was a real team man, a man who lived life free, fearless always. He was a warrior. He was not someone who sought the highest honour. He cared more for his comrades, his brothers on the front line. That is perhaps the reason, more than any other, that he deserves to be recognised in this way. His brother has said that he was a very humble person who shunned the limelight and would have seen this not as a reward for himself but as a recognition for his fellow soldiers. If somehow he could have seen into the future and known that one day he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, with his unit having been awarded the first battle honour in over 40 years, it would have meant a lot to him. The 2nd Commando Regiment was awarded the Eastern Shah Wali Kot Battle Honour, the first battle honour awarded since 1969, on 19 June, just three days before the tragic loss of Corporal Baird. I know that this would have been a great source of pride for a man like Corporal Baird, someone who gave himself to all those around him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   At this time I think of all those who served alongside Corporal Baird and who had the privilege of knowing him—his mates. They are the men and women who live today to tell the story of his life and of his service to his nation. For them, and for all of those who have known and served alongside him, the awarding of this honour may be tinged with sadness, but there is also pride for the man who made the ultimate sacrifice heroically defending his mates from danger. This feeling of pride, tinged with sadness, reverberates across my local community, which surrounds the Holsworthy Army base. Addressing parliament following Corporal Baird's passing last June, I discussed the hurt and shock felt across our region when the news comes of the loss of one of our local soldiers, because the defence community is so tightly intertwined with the local community. Now I can say that the pride generated from the awarding of the Victoria Cross to one of our own reverberates just as strongly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Corporal Baird enlisted in 2000 and, following basic training, was posted to the Holsworthy Army base in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent, serving with the 4th Battalion,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
                    Royal Australian Regiment
                   </a>
                   (Commando), which became the 2nd Commando Regiment. The men of the 2nd Commando Regiment live by the motto 'Without warning'. Their motto acutely describes the field battle in which the 2nd Commando Regiment is utilised as a modern, highly trained forward unit and it describes the strategies used by the commandos on the ground. It also describes the individuals themselves. The men of the 2nd Commando Regiment have no fear. They are always ready and will strike and take the initiative without warning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In the run-up to the previous election campaign I had the great honour of visiting, with the Prime Minister, the 2nd Commando Regiment at Holsworthy. I remember walking around. To this day, the thing that struck me was the fitness, strength and even the height of these men. These are our best Australians. I could not help thinking that day, 'Thank goodness that they are on our side!'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Corporal Baird was the personification of this powerful motto. His colleagues described him as an iconic figure in the regiment. For him, his service was not a vocation; it was a calling. At this time I think it is important to recognise and remember the reasons that Corporal Baird was in Afghanistan. We must never forget the evil of the Taliban. This is a group that uses children as suicide bombers. Perhaps the true evil of the Taliban, which Corporal Baird fought against, is best exemplified by their attacks on a 14-year-old school girl, whose crime, in their eyes, was to advocate for the education of girls.
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taliban" rel="nofollow">
                    The Taliban
                   </a>
                   actually sent their hit men, armed with guns, onto a school bus to shoot that young girl in the head. That is the evil that we were up against.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is education—especially the education of girls—that is the silver bullet in many countries they can counteract poverty, instability and general inequality. Those are the three things that allow groups like the Taliban to prosper and thrive. That is why they are so opposed to these things. That shows the absolute evil of this group, and that is what Corporal Baird was fighting against. That is why he was in Afghanistan, and we should never, ever forget that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There is a quotation commonly attributed to Winston Churchill:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is something that we should be thankful for. This is why men like Corporal Baird, and those he served alongside, have our eternal gratitude and our deepest respect. Lest we forget.

                    , Iraq and Afghanistan. I am very proud to speak on this condolence motion today. In 2007, Cameron Baird was awarded the medal for gallantry for his recovery of a wounded team member under heavy fire. We saw his bravery yet again—clearly it was just part of who Cameron Baird was—on 22 June last year, when he repeatedly drew enemy fire on himself with the sole purpose of protecting his comrades. In doing so, he laid down his life for his mates.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Corporal Baird, as we know, was leading a team in an assault on an enemy compound in June last year, in Afghanistan. When they came under heavy machine gun fire he broke cover—a courageous move—to draw the fire upon himself. Regaining momentum, he forced his way into the compound. It was here that he lost his life. His courageous charge into the compound under fire is the reason he has been awarded the Victoria Cross. We all stand in awe of his courage. It is often quoted, 'Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friend.' It is far less often witnessed. I would suggest that Cameron Baird's bravery on that day will live on and on in the hearts and the minds of those who were with him at that time.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I would like to pass on my deepest respects and condolences to Cameron Baird's family. We were honoured to meet them on that day in the parliament. What a courageous family they are: Doug and Kay and his brother Brendan, as well as the wider Baird family and his friends. All of his friends would be feeling this in equal quantities: they would be proud but they would be sad because they have lost someone they loved. So, I would say it is pride mixed with great sorrow. The family and Cameron have a nation's gratitude. In that citation the words of self-sacrifice and preserving the lives of his team members are in the finest traditions of the Army and Defence Forces and describe who Cameron Baird was. I will echo the sentiments of my colleagues: rest in peace. Again, I offer my condolences to his family.

                     I rise also to associate myself with the comments of previous speakers. I rise to honour a brave Australian who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of our country. Recently Corporal Cameron Baird was posthumously awarded the

                     ; he was the 100th recipient of the medal, the highest award presented for bravery. Corporal Baird displayed selflessness and heroism in Afghanistan which saw him pay the ultimate self-sacrifice in order to save the lives of his team members, and his actions embody the Victoria Cross inscription for valour.

                     The Victoria Cross has a rich history within the Australian armed forces. Australian troops were first recognised for their gallantry during the

                     , where he located and rescued 40 men after an attack, while struggling with his own injuries and avoiding enemy fire. Keith is the last living recipient of the original imperial VC and he is a living legend. I have had the good fortune of knowing Keith for over 20 years. Keith resides in Mackay. I used to manage a pub, and the guy who introduced me to Keith said, 'Keith's a VC.' Being young and impressionable, I asked, 'What's a VC?' As a result, I had to shout the bar. Keith's workload as a VC should also be recognised. He attends events on behalf of the RSL throughout the area. He has spent his time since retiring from the armed services as an active member in the veteran community. In particular, Keith has invested a lot of his time in counselling returned service men and women who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder—an issue which he feels continues to be ineffectively dealt with. Keith has said in the past that the battle for recognition of

                     In my electorate is Canungra warfare training centre. There is a memorial there planted with small trees to emulate the forests they fought in in Vietnam. It is not uncommon to see Keith disappear into the scrub and sit quietly where he feels he can best connect with those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.

                     Corporal Cameron Baird at a young age proved he was a truly inspirational man and made the greatest sacrifice for the safety of others and the freedom of our nation. To his father, Doug, his mother, Kaye, his brother, Brendan, and his nephews Riley and Max I offer my deep and heartfelt condolences. Our nation owes Corporal Cameron Baird and his family a debt that we can never repay.

An unintended consequence of this condolence motion is that it has made me put the face of my own daughter on that sacrifice. I would struggle as a parent to have to bury my own child. It must be a heart-wrenching experience for this family. However, this award places him in Australia's military history. Lest we forget.

                      I am deeply moved by the speeches I have heard in this chamber today and throughout the condolence motion. I associate myself with the comments that have been made by my colleagues. I rise to speak about one of Australia's true heroes, Corporal Cameron Baird. Corporal Baird is the 100th Australian recipient of Australia's most prestigious medal awarded for valour in military action, the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
                       Victoria Cross
                      </a>
                      . This is the highest military decoration for valour in the Commonwealth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Corporal Baird's story is a truly remarkable one. Born in Burnie, Tasmania, in 1981, Corporal Baird was an avid athlete before he joined the army. He was a member of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Cannons" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                      , a feeder team to the

                       AFL
                      </a>
                      , where only the best young players in the country have the opportunity to display their talents. As the world brought in a new millennium, a young Cameron Baird joined the armed forces. After completing his training he was posted to the 4th Battalion (Commando),
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                      . Corporal Baird would later go on to join the special forces. During his time in the armed forces he would serve in Timor-Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan. Incredibly, he served a tour in Afghanistan five times. His fifth tour of Afghanistan would prove to be his last.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Corporal Baird has been described as a natural leader, and it was while leading on the field of battle, tragically, that he lost his life. During an operation to secure an enemy position Corporal Baird valiantly stormed the compound, taking grenade and gunfire and drawing attention away from his comrades. This selfless act allowed his fellow special forces mates to take the position. It was a selfless act that cost Corporal Cameron Baird his life. This act of bravery was hardly surprising, given his previous actions in the field. Corporal Baird received numerous awards and citations and the deserved accolades that went with them. Not including this most recent recognition, Corporal Baird received the Medal for Gallantry; the

                      Mr and Mrs Baird and the entire Baird family: we, on behalf of the Australian people, give thanks for your son. Your son is a hero and, although no words will ever bring him back, we take solace in the knowledge that his actions saved many others so that other families need not share a similar pain. We grieve with you and acknowledge your terrible sacrifice. Corporal Cameron Baird VC, MG—lest we forget.

                       I join with colleagues on both sides of the chamber to speak in relation to Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird VC,

                       , and I say at the outset, on behalf of the people of Gippsland, that I would like to extend my personal condolences to Corporal Baird's family and associate myself with the remarks of many other speakers who have spoken in a very emotional and moving way in relation to his extraordinary service to our nation.

                       Corporal Baird was on his fifth special forces tour when he was killed in action. He was the 40th Australian soldier to be killed in Afghanistan. His unit, the 2nd

                      <p>
                       Corporal Baird's acts of valour and self-sacrifice preserved the lives of his team members. His actions were of the highest order, and in keeping with the finest traditions of the

                       The Victoria Cross is not an honour that people actively seek out. The Victoria Cross has been described as a golden thread linking acts of extraordinary courage and selflessness. As the citation reads, Corporal Baird's Victoria Cross is:

                       as a Commando Team leader. As one of his comrades testified: 'By disregarding his own safety numerous times in order to assault a heavily armed and fortified enemy position, Corporal Baird's courage and resolve provided the tipping point. His repeated attempts to attack that room with six insurgents inside was the bravest event that I have ever seen.' And they are strong words when the bravest of the brave speaks so highly of one of their fallen comrades. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in his address last week:

                      <p class="italic">

                      <p>
                       As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, I am acutely aware of how precious these awards are to the serving members and their families. It is important that we do recognise their service and acknowledge these moments of extreme bravery and sacrifice. I think it is also fitting that this parliament pauses and expresses its views and support on behalf of their constituents.

                       and place yourself in harm's way. As I meet with more members of the Australian Defence Force on a daily basis, I am constantly struck by two things. The first is their age—it must be a sign of my accumulated birthdays that I am constantly struck by the youthfulness of the men and women in the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force. The other thing that strikes me as I meet with our defence personnel is their dedication: they have remarkable values of courage, honesty and commitment to duty, and they are extraordinarily professional and they are dedicated to the job they have chosen to do.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I also have responsibility, in my role, for the Australian Defence Force honours and awards, within my portfolio. I receive daily correspondence from serving members and their families detailing the courage of our Australian defence forces. I would like to thank Doug, Kaye and the Baird family for lending their medal to the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
                        Australian War Memorial
                       </a>
                       . There probably can be no better example of a bittersweet moment for the Baird family than to have lost their dearly loved son but have seen the outpouring of support from a grateful nation which has expressed its thanks with its highest possible military honour. As Prime Minister Abbott remarked at his address at the Victoria Cross investiture ceremony, 'We will always draw strength from his actions, for we are a nation of memory not just of memorials.' The medal will be displayed in the Hall of Valour, for young Australians to learn about the actions of Corporal Baird and his unit and to serve as a reminder of the courage and selflessness of serving Australian men and women.
