        I want to chat today about the

        . We've had some really exciting news in my federal seat of Petrie, with the Redcliffe Dolphins being announced as the 17th team to enter the

        Back in 2015, I asked the people of Petrie to support a petition for the federal government to build a new stadium at the Dolphins sports precinct in Redcliffe, and they didn't disappoint. I want to thank all of those people and everyone involved in the community that supported this bid. It has seen world-class facilities built for the rugby league community, to be shared also with other sports. We have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Roar_FC" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Roar FC
        </a>
        playing their A-League games in Redcliffe as well. I know the Chief Government Whip is a big supporter of the Brisbane Roar, and he often comes out, and that exemplifies what this new stadium, Moreton Daily Stadium, has done for Redcliffe. Like the member here, the Chief Government Whip, people come out to games regularly. It's brought tourism to our community. It's also brought women's sport and it's also brought community groups. The federal government's $8 million investment on behalf of Australians towards the redevelopment of the club facilities, improving seating capacity, and new female amenities and change rooms was the beginning of a fantastic partnership that will, importantly, lead to more local jobs and local opportunities. We've also seen films being highlighted out here at the stadium, with the

        It was a well deserved win, too, with the club's 74 years of proud rugby league history, producing 32 Queensland reps and 23 Kangaroos. The club boasts over 800 juniors, and, if you consider the catchment of
