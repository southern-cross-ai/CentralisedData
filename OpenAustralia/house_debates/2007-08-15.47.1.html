        My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Is the minister aware of any examples of schools being used for blatant political purposes, particularly in Queensland? As a co-funder of these schools, what is the government’s response?

         I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Howard government listens and responds to the concerns of local people in local communities. A fantastic example of this is the Investing in Our Schools program. Members on this side will recall that school communities—the parents, teachers and students—were concerned that their state government schools were being neglected by state governments in their failure to fund basic items like playground equipment, libraries and science equipment. These school communities raised the issues with federal members on this side of the House. The government listened and responded with the $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools program. Nearly $830 million of that program has been invested in state government schools.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know the member for Moreton is very pleased with the outcome in his electorate, where over $3.3 million has been provided to 27 state government schools. Naturally, these school communities invite our local members along to view the projects—

           Naturally, these school communities invite their local members who have fought so hard for these schools along to their schools and want to show them the projects and also to raise with them their concerns about the continuing chronic neglect of their schools by state governments. Mr Speaker, what do you think the response would be from Queensland? After all, in Queensland the Howard government has invested a further $123 million in state government schools. What do you think the response of the Queensland government would be? Do you think it would have sent a note thanking the Prime Minister for this additional $123 million? No, the response from Premier Beattie—or should we call him Emperor Beattie, he who says he will reign for 100 years—

            <p>
             Thank you, Treasurer—Emperor Beattie and his consort Rusty have now decreed that no federal member is allowed anywhere near a state government school without personal permission, which may or may not be provided; it can be withheld on a whim. That is sheer arrogance on the part of the Queensland government. The Queensland government is gagging our schools. We are investing in our schools; the Labor Party in Queensland is gagging our schools.
