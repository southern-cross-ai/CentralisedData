       <p>
        The Daintree microgrid project is signed, sealed and about to be delivered. I have fought tirelessly for this project for more than two decades and I am immensely pleased that the construction will start later this year. I could stand here for hours and talk about the microgrid project and the benefit of the hydrogen, but there is a long history in getting to this point. However, I just want to pay tribute to the people who have been with me on this journey from the beginning. I have often reminisced about this journey with Daintree resident
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Hinton" rel="nofollow">

        from Floravilla ice cream, who has been with me right from the beginning. Unfortunately, three other people who were involved in the initial discussions over so many years—Lynda and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nicholas" rel="nofollow">

        from the Daintree tea plantation, and Betty's husband, Bill—have sadly all since passed away.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to pay tribute to and personally thank long-term Daintree residents Russell and Teresa O'Doherty. They were the ones that really copped a lot of flak over many, many years for their campaigning on this issue. Their unwavering support, their absolute passion in making this happen and their dedication to supporting this project are what has actually made it become a reality. Unfortunately, Russell and Teresa have recently moved out of the area to other places, but there's no doubt that it's successful because of them.
