        Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with a Disability. In establishing the day for people with a disability, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        aims to promote awareness of disability issues and the talents and achievements of people with a disability. This is a significant day and one worth recognising in this chamber when one considers the number of people in each of our electorates who are living with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         The Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        reports that one in five Australians, or 3.95 million people, have a disability and that over 2½ million Australians take on some sort of a caring role to assist people with disabilities. We all need to take the time to acknowledge and understand the needs of people with disability in our community—and, just as importantly, their hopes and aspirations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I raise an issue that has been brought to my attention by an organisation in my electorate that is doing great work for people with disability. Capricorn Citizen Advocacy is a community based organisation in Rockhampton that uses the principles of citizen advocacy to improve the lives of people with disability. Capricorn Citizen Advocacy works by finding and supporting caring, responsible citizens who make a long-term voluntary commitment to make a positive difference in the life of a person who may be lonely, face difficult challenges or be in at-risk situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team at Capricorn Citizen Advocacy recruit, orientate and match people with disability and voluntary citizen advocates to ensure that there is a good match between the interests and needs of the protege and the abilities, resources and commitment of the citizen advocate. Capricorn Citizen Advocacy is one of many organisations across Australia carrying out this essential role of providing advocates for people with disability. Like all services committed to the interests of people with disability, it is very concerned about the future of the government’s National Disability Advocacy Program. There are 71 disability advocacy programs in Australia funded under the NDAP and they have been in limbo all year as a result of government delays and ineptitude.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for Family and Community Services kicked off the year with a review of the program and since then there have been non-stop discussion papers and consultations but no decisions. In early October, the shadow minister for ageing, disabilities and carers urged the minister to make a decision in relation to funding for disability advocacy services, as the lack of action was leading to the slow death of the program. Services around the country were reporting that the uncertainty surrounding the program was leading them to lose valuable and experienced staff and they were unable to sign leases for their premises and unable to take on new clients, even though the demand for services was there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister has now announced a funding offer to current services, but it appears that the offer is conditional on the services meeting additional and unspecified new service standards. Does the minister seriously expect organisations to expand their services while they receive the same amount of money? The coordinator of Capricorn Citizen Advocacy, Jenny Keerie, is deeply concerned that the government’s actions may lead to wholesale changes in the capacity for advocacy services to continue their great work—in particular for those who might otherwise fall through the cracks without an individual approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        I might note for the record that Capricorn Citizen Advocacy in my electorate is, in fact, state funded; it is not directly affected by the delays in achieving these new funding agreements. Nonetheless, it is very committed to the principles and the concept of advocacy and is taking on this fight on behalf of and in solidarity with the other advocacy services around the country that are affected by this uncertainty in the Commonwealth program. As we mark the International Day of People with a Disability, I believe it is time for the government to recognise the vital role of advocacy services in empowering people with disability and to end the uncertainty that has hung over the sector all year.
