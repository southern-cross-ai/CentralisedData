        As we approach Veterans' Health Week next week, I would like to commend the Morrison government for the ongoing investment that this budget makes to veterans and their families. The 2021 budget aims to support veterans as they transition to civilian employment and also to support veterans' ongoing health, both physically and mentally. In Stirling we have a very rich ex-service community. There's a number of active
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL

        sub branches, including the North Beach RSL, where my wife and I have been members for the last decade. This budget responds to a number of issues and recommendations that members of the veteran community have raised with me and others.
       </p>

        Many more businesses are now realising that hiring a veteran is simply good for business. These ADF personnel were initially selected for their skills and their attitudes and Defence has constantly invested in their professional development. So those hiring a veteran are able to tap into the skills and attitudes, the experience, the team work, the discipline and the leadership abilities of these fantastic men and women. To assist ADF members transition to employment, we're investing $23 million in a joint transition authority and also expanding the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program to provide further support to veterans who might be interested in starting their own business. I especially commend those in my home state of

        and Jamie Cooper-Maitland from Defence West are also striving hard for policy and practical measures that help veterans to connect with employers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the majority of veterans leave the ADF in excellent physical and mental health, some do struggleâ€”and, sadly, there were 33 deaths by suicide in 2018. Minister Chester has made clear, as do I, that responding to that is an absolute priority for the Morrison government and that, whilst the annual figure is lower than in 2017, we still have much work to do. So I am pleased that the Morrison government is providing more than $100 million to further bolster medical and mental health support for veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am confident that, with these and other budget measures, along with the continued support that myself and other veterans enjoy and the Morrison government's commitment to listening to and acting on reforms, we can deliver practical outcomes in support of those who have given so much for our nation.
