       <p>
        I am very pleased to rise to speak on the private member's motion moved by my colleague the member for Moreton. In recent times there has been a lot of discussion and debate about the opportunities and the prospects for baby boomers and the millennials. The nature of the debate at times has become a case of resentment and blame by one group for the other. This is understandable, as millennials face mounting burdens of cost associated with getting an education—a lack of affordability of university and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        education and training and mounting debt for university graduates—and then, of course, difficulties in finding employment, and even, as we've heard on many occasions, the difficulty—almost impossibility—of buying a house. Young people today point to the generations before them and feel aggrieved. Many refer to even my own generation as the lucky generation. Of course, my generation—and others before me—did start off on a low base and had to fight for our rights for a lot of things, including affordable education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education is the building block to every Australian's life. It's what gives us the ability to function and contribute in our modern society and to build or nation's social cohesion and prosperity. Without access to an affordable and relevant education system, my generation, at a critical time in our post-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        nation-building, may never have realised its full potential and therefore gone on to make the contribution it has made. Affordable education and the opportunities it affords were vital for my generation, and it's absolutely important and vital to our generation today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor's understanding of education as the great enabler is marked by some of the greatest and most significant reforms by successive Labor governments since the Whitlam government swept into power in 1972. The most recent landmark reform in education in Australia came from the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, with the Gonski funding reforms. In commencing the 46th Parliament we enter the third consecutive term of a coalition government. An assessment of this government's record in education and training is what the member for Moreton's motion aims to do. This motion lays bare in great detail the extent and impact of the coalition's cuts to schools, universities and TAFEs—cuts that have resulted in the future opportunities of young Australians being curtailed by the inability of the government to address the educational needs of Australian students.
       </p>
       <p>
        For almost seven years now, Australian schoolchildren who are either learning or earning through the school, tertiary or vocational education system have been system suffering from underinvestment because of significant cuts, leaving young people in despair about their future employment prospects. The coalition government's achievements—or underachievements—in relation to cuts include the slashing of $30 billion over the past decade from projected school funding. Literacy and numeracy in schoolchildren has fallen. There hasn't really been any action from government to improve school standards. The dismantling of our TAFE system has let to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        students paying a lot more for courses. Apprenticeships and on-the-job trainings have declined. They've capped university places.
       </p>
       <p>
        All around, the basic failure of the government to address these issues has meant that the people in my electorate have been very adversely affected. Calwell continues to be home to a large number of old and new migrant communities. My constituents, like generations before them, rely on education systems that are affordable and accessible and relevant to the demands and requirements of today's society. Coming largely from non-English-speaking migrant and refugee backgrounds, like my generation before them, my constituents need to have access—access is the key word—to the best-quality education if they are to realise their potential and go on to make their contribution. It is, after all, something we keep encouraging them to do, especially during citizenship ceremonies. We value education highly in Calwell and we aspire to give ourselves and our children the best possible opportunities. This is a time when globalisation has challenged us with opportunities and possibilities but also with changes that have left many people behind. The coalition government's years of cuts and neglect have been detrimental to my community, which is also, by the way, experiencing a youth unemployment rate of 25 per cent in some cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is evidence of this government's neglect and lack of preparedness in the findings of a recently released report from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        , which recommends that the school system needs to greater prepare young people with stronger literacy and numeracy skills so they can succeed at university or broadly in the Australian community.

        <p>
         This is the first time I'm speaking in this chamber as the new member for Macnamara, and there's no better motion to be debating than my good friend the member for Moreton's motion on schools. It's a shame that we seem to go from Labor speaker to Labor speaker because the government simply isn't interested in speaking about schools. I note in the chamber we have my good friend the member for Berowra, who has spoken on the motion but who seems to be without friends on this one. That is certainly noted in the first speech.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wanted to start my remarks on this motion—a really important motion—by talking about a school close to my home,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Eira_College" rel="nofollow">
          Glen Eira College
         </a>
         . Glen Eira College is a fascinating study in the difference between cutting funding to education and providing investment to schools. When I was in year 7, Glen Eira College wasn't an option for my family. It was a school where a lot of students had a range of behavioural difficulties, behavioural issues. It was a school with, quite frankly, a drug problem, and it was a school that had about 250 students who basically didn't have any other choice. It was a really difficult choice for a lot of parents. Over time, that school has been invested in, has had some outstanding principals and teachers, and the culture of that school has completely changed. Now it is a school that I would be so proud to send one of my children or my daughter to—I only have one child, and I'm glad I have got this on the record as well. But it is a fantastic school and one we can all be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
         During my time at university, I also worked as a teacher's aide inside the classroom. It was clear at that time that you only needed to spend an hour in the classroom to see that, with 21 different students running around, there were 21 different lessons going on. That requires the effort and the attention of outstanding people and those people are our teachers. They put so much time and effort into making sure each and every student has what they need to get a great education. I think that is what goes to the heart of this motion.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2013,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
          Julia Gillard
         </a>
         had an idea that schools should be funded on the needs of the child to learn. It was the National Partnership Agreement; we all know it as the Gonski reforms. It was a profound idea that in Australia a school is not funded based on its postcode or its achievement but on what we need to provide Australian schools in order to make sure our students can get the best education. We all remember, going into the 2013 election, the famous lines by the then opposition leader
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott
         </a>
         , who said there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to the ABC or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
          SBS
         </a>
         , and we saw nothing but slash, slash, cut, cut, cut.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leading into this election there was also a further reform of the National Partnership Agreement by the current Prime Minister, where a deal was done with the Catholic and independent schools to return some of that funding by the initial National Partnership Agreement back to the Catholic and independent schools. To be frank, I supported that move. I think there are a number of those schools that absolutely needed that funding. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be providing that funding to our public schools. And quite frankly, I think it is un-Australian to have a situation where we are putting funding into our private and independent schools and not putting it into our public schools.
        </p>
        <p>
         In McNamara, my electorate, we had a situation where the Labor Party was coming to the election with a vastly different set of commitments to the coalition. It was going to mean another $11 million to schools in my electorate, which included $580,000 extra for Albert Park Primary School, $460,000 for Caulfield Junior College, $840,000 for Elwood Primary School, $590,000 for St Kilda Primary School and the list goes on. That is all funding for more teachers' aides, smaller class sizes, literacy and numeracy support, and a range of other things to give teachers the support they need in order to provide for the needs of each and every student.
        </p>
        <p>
         It wasn't just for teaching and learning outcomes; we also came with a range of building upgrades that I was pleased to support for Ripponlea Primary School, Windsor Primary School, Glen Eira College and Port Melbourne Primary. We came with a very full and ambitious education plan. One of the many frustrations of the election was that, while obviously we didn't get everything right and we accept this result was the choice of the Australian people, I was really proud to campaign for our ambitious schools policy. I commend the motion of the member for Moreton to this place.
