        I've been booted off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">

        for a three-minute speech I gave in the other chamber. I was disappointed about that because, for me of all people to be booted off YouTube, it was quite a surprise to me. All I was doing was asking a question on excess deaths in Australia and quoting ABS,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics

        , figures. If you had a four per cent increase in excess deaths in Australia, you'd say, 'Well, that's like a one-in-100-year flood.' I suppose, if you got a 14 per cent increase in excess deaths in Australia, you'd have a tsunami on your hands, but I didn't even mention that in the speech. I mean, coming from a backbench in opposition in the Australian parliament, it's in the

        It's about as low as you can go as a backbencher in opposition. There is one place further to goâ€”that's probably out the door, and don't get excited about that too quickly! So I say to YouTube: why are you censoring an Australian parliamentarian for just reasonable remarks about ABS figures in this country? It's totally unacceptable when, after you genuinely upload a three-minute speech on mortality rates in Australia, an international company kicks you off. It's unbelievable, and I'm especially surprised because it was me. Who am I to be kicked off?
