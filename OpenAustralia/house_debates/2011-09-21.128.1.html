        I consider this session of parliament a very historic session of parliament because we will be introducing into this parliament a series of bills that will provide a new era for farming in this country. I want to read into the
        <i>

        of the parliament of Australia for future generations, the group who have inspired and driven me, and I suppose have been my spiritual mentors. I asked one of them to become my campaign director. Another one of them is the person who eventually convinced me that I simply had to get out of the party I was in and represent the people I was paid to represent—that is, Max Srhoj. I want to put on the record my personal thanks to Max for forcing me to do the right thing.

John kept a very tight rein on all of us. Even the secretary of the organisation, Bernie O'Shea—the driving force and also my campaign director and guiding light—was not restrained. They gave the government and the minister who turned up—then Deputy Prime Minister,

        —a very good hearing. They put their position very forthrightly that they were all being destroyed and would continue to be destroyed if the government continued on with their policies of marketism, which had been the policy of the Labor Party.

        After probably 18 months it was quite clear that the LNP was never going to do anything for us, except to continue the destruction of agriculture in Australia.
