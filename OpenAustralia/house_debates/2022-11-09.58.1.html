         I thank the member for Paterson. The parliament would be aware that last night data that was exfiltrated during the Medibank attack was released on the dark web. Based on the information that we have at this moment, the number of citizens whose medical information may have been compromised is small at this stage. But I want the Australian people to understand that that is likely to change, and we are going through a difficult period now that may last for weeks—possibly months—not days and hours. I cannot articulate the disgust I have for the scumbags who are at the heart of this criminal act. People are entitled to keep their health information private. Even amongst ransomware attackers the idea of releasing the personal medical information of other people is considered beyond the pale. So, make no mistake about it: this is not just any ordinary group of scummy criminals; this is the lowest of the low.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want Australians to know that your government stands with you. The Prime Minister said this morning that he is a Medibank customer, like millions of other Australians. I am, too. The Australian government has been preparing for the eventuality that is now taking place for a number of weeks. We've been doing this through the National Coordination Mechanism, which the Minister for Health and I both attended this morning. The actions of the National Coordination Mechanism to prepare for what is taking place are extensive. This includes placing protective security around government data. It includes state police working with affected individuals. It includes the organisation of mental health support and counselling. It includes putting in place management plans around people who have some very specific vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge the outstanding work that has taken place already from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         and the Australian Signals Directorate. They are the best in the world at what they do, and the Australian government thanks you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts in helping protect us. The eSafety Commissioner has been included in the National Coordination Mechanism because social media companies and indeed traditional media companies are going to be crucial in our national response to this problem. And I say now, I know I do not need to point out the importance of social media companies not allowing this information to be published and not allowing it to be shared on your platforms, and the importance of traditional media companies not publishing the private information of Australians. If you do so you will be aiding and abetting the scumbags who are at the heart of these criminal acts, and I know you would not do that to your own country and your own fellow citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is stepping up and addressing this problem. I've said before that we are about five years behind where we should be with regard to cybersecurity, and there is a power of work underway at the moment to change that. We are working hard to protect you and to protect our country.
