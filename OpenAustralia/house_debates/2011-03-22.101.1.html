        On the morning of Sunday, 27 March the Wheelie Big Challenge will take place, which is a fundraising event for sufferers of a cerebral palsy. Tragically and unfortunately there is such a sufferer whom I have had some contact with in recent months. Emily Prior is three years old. Three years ago she and her twin sister, Reese, were born at just 29 weeksâ€”seriously early. At birth they weighed less than 1,500 grams and they both battled to survive. When Emily was just four weeks old the doctors informed her parents that due to bleeding of the brain at the time of birth it was likely that she had cerebral palsy. Sadly, that was the case. But Emily Prior is a beautiful little three-year-old. She is irrepressible despite her walker that she uses to get around. She always has a huge smile and is a bright, bubbly and vivacious young lady. At just three years old she is very, very positive. Fortunately, she has received great support from the early intervention program with the Centre for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_Palsy" rel="nofollow">
         Cerebral Palsy
        </a>
        . She is also a recipient of Botox injections which are delivered under general anaesthetic. That has enabled her to have a whole lot more freedom of movement in her legs. So she is doing pretty well.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday, I, my family and my staff that have volunteered will be at the Wheelie Big Challenge to support Emily. While we will not have a problem walking one kilometre, Emily, with an attitude that is driven, will be doing that kilometre in her walking frame. That is a great testament to a tough and outstanding little girl. We hope that the family will reach its target of $5,000 by Sunday, which will help with research into cerebral palsy and provide assistance not only for Emily but also for others who suffer under these circumstances. As a sponsor of, I fully endorse this event. It is a great initiative.
