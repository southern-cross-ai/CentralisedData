        My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Is he aware of statements by Sheikh al-Hilali relating to the role of women and religious conflict? Do such comments have the potential to divide the Australian community and what is the government’s response?

         The government, like many in the Australian community, has condemned very strongly the comments make by Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Hilali about women, particularly about sexual assault and religious conflict. The comments, as far as the government is concerned, are unacceptable. They have no place in our society. His comments on jihad in particular contradict what we are told are the basic philosophies and essence of everything for which Islam stands. Those who ask for tolerance from others, in our view, should show the same tolerance themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sheikh’s views on women are not shared by the majority of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_community" rel="nofollow">
          Muslim community
         </a>
         , and many prominent Australian Muslims, including many women, have spoken out strongly against his views. This is a matter that needs to be addressed by his community, and I am pleased at the efforts that have been made thus far, but I think they still have some way to go. This, of course, is not the first time that comments made by the sheikh have created concern in the Australian community. It is disappointing that this issue was not dealt with properly in the 1980s and 1990s, when similarly divisive and controversial statements were made. It was then open to the government to deal with this matter when the sheikh’s application for permanent residency was made in the 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>
         The then immigration minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hurford" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Hurford
         </a>
         , considered that application and did not approve it. However, this decision, as he has made clear, was overturned by one of his successors. That happened after the intervention of senior Labor ministers, including the former Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Keating
         </a>
         , who acknowledged in this chamber on 18 September 1990 that he had made representations on the sheikh’s behalf. I raised the matter at that time, as I might say did the member for Mitchell, who has had a very considerable concern about these issues over a long time. I was criticised roundly by Labor ministers at that time for raising it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Interestingly, in 2003 in the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Review" rel="nofollow">
           Adelaide Review
          </a>
         </i>
         Mr Hurford explained his decision to reject this application. He said it was based on the sheikh’s lengthy history of inflaming divisions in the community. Mr Hurford went on to tell the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         that he believed residency was granted because the Labor government ‘erroneously believed this would have some political influence in particular electorates at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         state election’. That was Chris Hurford’s view. Labor knew there was a problem then and they chose to ignore it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition leader’s response on the
         <i>
          Sunday
         </i>
         program—that we have to live with it—avoids very clearly the responsibility that he and his colleagues had. This incident has divided the Muslim community, and it has not been helpful to relations between Australian Muslims and the rest of the community. Australia is a tolerant and multicultural society and there is room for all religions, but people who live here must respect the rule of law and Australian values.
