        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. What is the Albanese government's plan to meet the national security challenges facing Australia in the region? Why is deeper engagement in the region important for Australia?

         I thank my good friend the member for

         for this question and congratulate him on his wonderful re-election to this place. Australia is facing the most complex set of strategic circumstances that we've had since the end of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . The global rules based order—which Australia helped build from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods" rel="nofollow">
          Bretton Woods
         </a>
         onwards, and, with the United States, has helped try to protect since then—is under more pressure and strain now than at any point since the end of the Second World War.
        </p>
        <p>
         Russia's appalling invasion of Ukraine—a large country seeking to impose itself on a smaller neighbour, not by reference to the rule of law but through might and power—is an example. But we see examples in the Indo-Pacific: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation—so important to us as an island trading nation—is also under strain. As China seeks to shape the world around it in a way that we have not seen before, this raises really complex challenges for Australia, not least because China is our largest trading partner. To be sure, we value a productive relationship with China, and we want to see that relationship in a better place. But, while the Australian government has changed, our national interest has not. The Albanese government is absolutely committed to standing up for Australia's national interest, particularly when that differs from the actions of other countries, including China.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the way forward is not obvious, what's really clear at this moment is that it is a time to be working with like-minded countries with our friends. This is why it was so important that the Prime Minister attend the meeting of the Quad, even though this occurred immediately after the last election. Indeed, the Prime Minister's presence was very profound. Since then, I have visited every member of the Quad—Japan, India and the United States—and what's really apparent is that, in each of our bilateral relationships with these countries, there has never been a greater degree of strategic purpose. There has never been more closeness in our relationship, including defence cooperation. That, combined with repairing our relationships with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         and rebuilding our relationships with Pacific island countries, makes it clear that, under this government, Australia is back at the table of the international community of nations.
        </p>
        <p>
         This stands in stark contrast to the government that was led by those opposite over nine years, who did nothing other than shout at the world. Strategic policy, foreign policy—it is not a fundamentalist space. We will engage with sense and with intelligence, and, precisely because of that, Australians will be safer.

          on indulgence—I want to join in support of the opening comments of the Minister for Defence—not the flourish at the end, obviously. This is an issue that is incredibly important for our country and for our region. It's important for us to have the strongest possible relationship with our allies, not just the United States and the United Kingdom but India, Japan and others in the region. We will support whatever action the government takes to take the decisions to keep our country safe in a very uncertain world.
