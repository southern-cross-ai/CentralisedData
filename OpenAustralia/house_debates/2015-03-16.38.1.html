       <p>
        We have a major issue surrounding young disabled people with high care needs. We all know stories of families wanting to keep them at home in the home environment. But sometimes the care needs are too great, and the families are not capable of maintaining the level of care needed. We have, in this country, over 6, 000 people under the age of 65 living in aged-care facilities because their needs are great and because we have nowhere else to care for them. Aged-care facilities are not set up for this specific kind of care. It is a crack in the system, and one which will widen without attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youngcare is an organisation which was formed with the specific purpose of assisting young Australians with high care needs for whom living in or facing the prospect of living in an aged-care facility is very real. Youngcare specialises in developing viable models to provide solutions for young people. They have a model which can be placed in just about any community. It is not cheap, nor is it easy, but Youngcare knows the benefits of providing appropriate housing and care to our most exposed. It is about providing choice and options for profoundly disabled young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youngcare has an event called Budgie Bolt. This is where you pull on your speedos and run six kilometres with your friends. It is about being a little bit uncomfortable. Unfortunately I am unavailable, and everyone should be thankful for that. But I will donate and I will do what I can to support it because I want a Youngcare facility established in Townsville.
