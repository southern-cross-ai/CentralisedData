        Yesterday, Sunday 25 September, I attended the opening of the bowls season at the Adelaide Bowling Club. I was accompanied by

        , the state member for Adelaide. We were honoured to put down the first bowl to start off the season. The Adelaide Bowling Club is one of the oldest lawn bowls clubs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        ; it was established in 1897. It also proudly hosted the nation's

        in April this year, which was broadcast around the world. But this is also a wonderful community club that brings together people of all ages. That is why I was so happy to fight for this club to get some extra funding so that they could continue to provide such a vital service. I supported their application for the Stronger Communities Program. The club was successful in getting $15,000, and they also secured a further $16,000 to refurbish their kitchen.

        It was a great day on Sunday. It highlighted just how popular the Adelaide Bowling Club is. I commend the club's president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Burton" rel="nofollow">

        ; their committee; the staff; and the volunteers for the amazing work that they do. We all know in our electorates that clubs, such as the Adelaide Bowling Club, provide such an important social, community and recreational service. I sincerely thank them for everything that they do in the community and in my seat of Adelaide, providing people the opportunity to get together, play a bit of sport and just have fun.
