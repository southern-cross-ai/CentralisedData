        Ted Hogan passed away in September this year, aged 88. I pay tribute to Ted and to his life. He was a beloved member of the Ipswich community and of the Labor Party in particular. He and his wife, Dorothy, or Dot, supported me in many campaigns over the years. Ted hasn't been well for some time, but you'd never know it from chatting with him. He was a former Queensland country police officer, which suited him perfectly. He had a strong sense of ethics and justice, fairness and service, care and compassion. He served in Ipswich and Brisbane, but he loved working in rural communities such as Gatton, Kalbar, Harrisville and Moore. After Ted retired, he continued his passionate love for and his interest in cars, particularly the

        . Both Ted and Dot have been active members of the Catholic community in Ipswich and Immaculate Heart Catholic Church in their home suburb of One Mile, where they both showed their Christian love for the local community in so many ways.

        The Hogan family is deeply respected in Ipswich. We will miss Ted's insights, stories, wisdom and spirited conversations. Ted is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dot; their six children; their 18 grandchildren; and their great-grandson. Rest easy, Ted. You've served our community well indeedâ€”in the
