        There's something awe-inspiring about the Australian bush. It's beautiful yet terrifying, inviting yet inhospitable, a strength in times of reflection and a terror in full fury. As a nation we can't afford a standing army to protect us against those moments when nature is in full fury, so we rely on volunteers. They are our first line of defence. In Berowra it's our

        Recently I joined over a thousand Rural Fire Service volunteers for the annual Hornsby Ku-ring-gai mayoral dinner. It's an opportunity to celebrate our local Rural Fire Service volunteers. The volunteers come from all backgrounds and all walks of life. During the dinner several brigades were given awards for their recent areawide training activities. Congratulations to Mount Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby on winning special awards, and a special congratulations to the Muogamarra brigade on winning every category and being named the overall champion. Thanks also to Patsy Marshall for organising a great night.

        Across Berowra there are over 1,500 local volunteers across 27 brigades who do a remarkable job. Led by superintendents

        Over the past year brigades across the two local districts have responded to over 700 incident calls. Floods, storms, multiple-vehicle accidents—no matter what the disaster, they're always there to lend a hand. RFS volunteers are such a valued addition to any community event. The role the RFS volunteers play in our fire safety is their most significant contribution. It's that time of the year, and we should remind ourselves of our bushfire survival plan and do the important preventative work like clearing out our gutters and clearing up the leaves and debris around our properties. If you've got a pool, get a static water supply—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWS" rel="nofollow">

        —sign at your property entrance. The pool of water might save your own home or a neighbour's home as well.

        Thanks again to the wonderful Rural Fire Service for all the work they do for our community and for all Australians.
