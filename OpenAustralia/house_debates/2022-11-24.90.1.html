        It was wonderful to see construction tenders open yesterday for the new Moranbah hospital. It will support 102 construction jobs and is scheduled for completion by June 2025, subject to tender negotiations. I have been a strong supporter of a new hospital in Moranbah for a long time, and I want to congratulate

        on their years of successful lobbying for this project. It is a timely announcement, given the current Moranbah hospital has been falling into disrepair and neglect for years under the Queensland Labor government.

        In 2020, five miners were seriously injured after an explosion at Grosvenor mine. The men suffered severe burns to their upper bodies and airways and were taken to Moranbah hospital in a serious condition. It was a miracle they survived. I was told of reports that the lack of staffing and equipment at the hospital was severe, and it was pure chance there were off-duty paramedics in town for a conference who were available to help.

        , and it seems like we must beg and borrow for every scrap of funding we can get from Brisbane and Canberra. Members in this place will be well reminded that Central Queensland is keeping the lights on for the nation. Ignore us at your own peril. The community uproar in Rockhampton over the funding delays to the Rocky Ring Road is a testament to that.
