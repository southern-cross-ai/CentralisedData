        I rise to congratulate the parents, teachers, principals and supporters of each and every primary school in Parramatta on the fine work they are doing to roll out the Building the Education Revolution in the Parramatta community. I have been doing my own inspection tour of proposed works in Parramatta and I cannot commend highly enough the commitment, flexibility and talent of our local principals. Already I have turned the first sod at

        , on a $3 million multipurpose hall—rather, I did not turn the sod, I stood and gave the thumbs up to a man in a giant borer nearly two storeys tall who proceeded to drill a large hole in the playground. I remembered that borer a few days later when the school captains and I struggled through the rocks and root-bound dirt at Dundas Public trying to turn the sod there: it took us 10 minutes, and it was only the raucous barracking of the other students that got us through in the end. But at St Monica’s it was smooth sailing with the borer, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Parramatta deserves congratulations for how creatively they have used the stimulus investment. Their already high level of preparedness has meant that they have been able to incorporate the new stimulus hall into the heart of a complete rejuvenation of the school. The new school design is amazing and will deliver a truly 21st century learning environment for the children at St Monica’s.

        Last week’s round 3 announcement added more than $22 million for more than 30 projects in 13 Parramatta primary schools and took the total

        investment in Parramatta past the $100 million mark for the first time. I am looking forward to many, many more sod-turning ceremonies.
