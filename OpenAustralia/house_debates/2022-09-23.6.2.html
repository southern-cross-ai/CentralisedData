        With the passing of Queen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth II
        </a>
        , an historic reign and a long life devoted to duty, family, faith and service have come to an end. The second Elizabethan age is over. Despite all the solemn pageantry that has served to remind us of this sad fact, it is hard to grasp that Queen Elizabeth II now belongs to the realm of memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        We give thanks for her long and exceptionally well lived life, and we do so here in the building she opened for a nation she loved as part of her greater family—a new permanent home for the parliament she described as 'both the living expression of that federation and the embodiment of the democratic principles of freedom, equality and justice'. When she joined
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        to do the honours in 1988 out there by the Michael Nelson Jagamara mosaic that so caught her eye, she could see the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        that her own father opened in 1927—what a shining thread through our houses of democracy, through our own history. Indeed, Her Majesty's reign was so long that, to most of us, she was simply always there. She was a rare and reassuring constant amidst rapid change. But even the brightest star must eventually set, leaving us with the memory of the glow. The Queen was our head of state for a majority of our existence as a federation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also important to remember the personal as well: a much-loved wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, the gravitational centre around which a family turned, which I believe is one of the reasons that she was always so much more than a monarch to us. The Queen lived a life of privilege but one that was always balanced by an unyielding sense of duty, of service, a desire to give. That noble counterweight of the spirit was something she bore faithfully for the United Kingdom, for Australia and for the great family of nations we call the Commonwealth—a family that grew so swiftly on her watch. Even as the focus began to shift more towards the individual, the Queen embodied a sense of duty that placed community and selflessness first. The Queen never lost her belief in society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Underpinning all of it was an inner strength, one that was tested early. The first time was when her uncle,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII" rel="nofollow">
         Edward VIII
        </a>
        , abdicated—a seismic act that shifted the crown onto her father's head, transforming him into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V" rel="nofollow">
         George V
        </a>
        I and the young princess into the heir to the throne. It all unfurled as Britain was about to face the threat of what Winston Churchill called 'the abyss of a new dark age'. The second time was when her beloved father died, aged just 56, finally spent by the burdens of war and illness.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Elizabeth" rel="nofollow">
         Princess Elizabeth
        </a>
        was only 25. The news reached her in Kenya the day before she and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">
         Prince Philip
        </a>
        were due to board the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        <i>
         Gothic
        </i>
        for their journey to Australia. The dream of relatively calm years raising a family with Philip was over. The princess returned to England as Queen, the responsibilities of the throne on one shoulder, the sudden absence of her father on the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Somehow in her grief she found the strength to measure up to the expectations of a nation and the thousand-year-old institution into which she had been born. When asked what name she would be taking as Queen, she bucked the trend by replying, 'My own, of course.' It was just one hint of the stability and continuity that she would provide. Over the past 184 years, the throne has been held by women for 133 of them—but, remarkably, just two women:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Victoria
        </a>
        , who was on the throne for over six decades, and her great-great-granddaughter Queen Elizabeth, the first British monarch to reign for seven decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it came to the relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and Australia, 16 truly was the number most recalled. Through her reign she consulted with 16 Australian prime ministers, starting with Sir
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Menzies
        </a>
        , and 16 governors-general, starting with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_McKell" rel="nofollow">
         Sir William McKell
        </a>
        . She made 16 visits to our shores, starting with a 58-day tour that saw her visit 57 towns and cities and pass through so many more. According to someone quoted at the time in the
        <i>
         Forbes
        </i>
        <i>
         Advocate
        </i>
        , 'By comparison, organising the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Games
        </a>
        would be quite simple.'
       </p>
       <p>
        She got to know us, appreciate us and embrace us. And the feeling was very much mutual. She handed out trophies in schools. She chatted with outback families on the radio. There were people to comfort and achievements to be celebrated. There were openings and festivals, rodeos and surf carnivals. She got to know our landscapes and our character. All the time, she was gently endearing herself ever deeper into our national life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along the way, Her Majesty had one of the most Australian experiences of all: sitting next to Bob Hawke at the races when his horse was winning. The photograph of these two connoisseurs of the turf in that moment is a perfect study in balance: the Queen sitting serenely; the Prime Minister like a firecracker in a suit. Bob was criticised, but, as he later reflected, 'I took great pleasure in pointing a little later to a photo of the Queen showing similar exultation when one of her horses won in England.'
       </p>
       <p>
        When she first came to us, our pockets jingled with pennies and shillings. Television was still in the future, as was the filling of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Burley_Griffin" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Burley Griffin
        </a>
        . When the Queen first addressed our parliament, she was one of just a handful of women in the room, and that wasn't the only deficit among the faces gazing up at her. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         White Australia
        </a>
        policy was still in place, and—the gift to the Queen of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Namatjira" rel="nofollow">
         Albert Namatjira
        </a>
        painting notwithstanding—this nation was still a long way off any sort of reckoning with the truth of this continent's first inhabitants. Since then, we've changed in so many ways for the better, and the Queen saw it all.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was the patron of more than 20 Australian charities and associations. Throughout her reign, Queen Elizabeth II showed a deep affection for her country. From her famous first trip to Australia, the only reigning sovereign to ever visit, it was clear Her Majesty held a special place in her heart for Australia. Fifteen more tours before cheering crowds in every part of the country confirmed the special place that she held in ours.
       </p>
       <p>
        As monarch for more than half the life of our federation, the relationship between Australia and Britain matured and evolved throughout Her Majesty's reign. The Queen greeted each and every change with understanding, good grace and an abiding faith in the Australian people's good judgement. This was the deft and diplomatic way she bound the diversity of the modern Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The world today is almost unrecognisable from what it was in 1952, and there is no doubt, given modern technology, including television, that the Queen is the most famous woman who during her life has walked this earth. Throughout all the tumult and noise and tectonic shifts in those 70 years, so many old certainties were broken. New, more tentative ones took their place. Throughout it all was Her Majesty, a Queen who let her humanity show, who stood with us in times of hardship, even as she had endured her own.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there was always Philip, whom the Queen once described as her 'strength and stay'. Between the layers of formality and protocol, we sometimes got glimpses of the affection and the tenderness between Queen and Duke. After Prince Philip died, the most striking image from the funeral was the most human: no pomp, no regal splendour—just the Queen, alone in her sorrow. As Her Majesty once put it, 'Grief is the price we pay for love.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Seventy years as sovereign is a towering record, yet what will always stand tallest in our hearts and our memories is the commitment and spirit to service and duty that the Queen so unflaggingly brought to her role and the pride and sense of unity that she engendered. The Queen served with dignity, fidelity, humour and a grace that was indefatigable, and she took nothing for granted. When she opened this place in 1988, she said something that rings even truer today given global events:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliamentary democracy is a compelling ideal, but it is a fragile institution. It cannot be imposed and it is only too easily destroyed. It needs the positive dedication of the people as a whole, and of their elected representatives, to make it work.
       </p>
       <p>
        We knew her voice and we knew her mannerisms: the stately expressions and the impish twinkle; the hats and the headscarves; the corgis and the horses; the hands that so lovingly gripped the steering wheels of generations of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rovers" rel="nofollow">

        to compose a suite for her and present her with the solitary copy of its only recording; a sovereign who appreciated the value of being roused from every sleep every morning by bagpipes, knowing no alarm clock could ever be quite so emphatic.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is perhaps fitting that in what proved to be the twilight of a remarkably long life she was drawn home to the corner of Scotland that spoke so powerfully to her heart. There at Balmoral, amid the sometimes severe splendour of the Highlands, she found that which eluded her in London: moments of solitude away from a life in the spotlight, the most famous woman in the world able to enjoy the luxury of the intimacy of family and of friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Sydney
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_House" rel="nofollow">
         Opera House
        </a>
        in 2000, Her Majesty bared the heart of her feelings for our country, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … since I first stepped ashore here … I have felt part of this rugged, honest, creative land. I have shared in the joys and the sorrows, the challenges and the changes that have shaped this country's history …
       </p>
       <p>
        But even as history continued to shape and change us and as the bond between our two nations evolved, the affection and respect in which we held Her Majesty remained. The Queen transcended barriers. You could be a republican and still feel nothing but regard and respect for her. She celebrated our good times and stood with us in our times of trial, bringing sympathy and comfort when it was so badly needed. Through fire and flood, drought and cyclone, and pandemic, she was there. As she said 20 years ago:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … my admiration, affection and regard for the people of Australia will remain, as it has been … constant, sure and true.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let it be said we felt the same way. The Queen always had a special place in the hearts of Australians, and she always will. I thank His Excellency the Governor-General and Mrs Hurley, as well as the Australians—led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Alcott" rel="nofollow">
         Dylan Alcott
        </a>
        , the Australian of the Year—who graced London as part of the delegation and did Australia proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts are with all the royal family as they mourn. In particular, we think of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles" rel="nofollow">
         King Charles
        </a>
        , who feels the weight of his sorrow as he takes on the weight of the Crown. When I met with him a few days ago in London, I conveyed on behalf of the Australian people our grief, our gratitude, our condolences and our respect. Our conversation was a reminder that Australia has always been very dear to him, not least Victoria, where he did some of his schooling all those years ago. As His Majesty put it on one occasion:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you want to develop character, go to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I admire King Charles's passion and his commitment to the natural environment and sustainability. At the dawn of his reign, we wish His Majesty well, and, now that the great Elizabethan reign is over, may Her Majesty rest in eternal peace.

         I thank the Prime Minister for his moving words and second the motion. It's a great honour to be here in this chamber; I appreciate the opportunity to reiterate and build upon my remarks at yesterday's solemn national memorial service. On the death of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
          Her Majesty

         I, I said:

        <p class="italic">
         Never in modern history has there been a more dignified monarch, a more dutiful leader, or a more decent human than Her Majesty Queen

          Elizabeth II

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The past 15 days of tears and tributes from around the world are testimony to the truth of that sentiment. We've been moved by the flowers laid, wreaths placed, notes left, speeches delivered, condolences penned, candles lit, prayers said, salutes fired and silences held—no more so than by the poignant final farewell of Her Majesty's state funeral. If 'grief is the price we pay for love', then the outpouring of global grief for our dearly departed sovereign speaks to just how much she was loved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queen Elizabeth's rule was extraordinary, the like of which we will never see again—a reign spanning 70 years with tens of thousands of public engagements. It's a legacy that little Lilibet could not have imagined. A sweet and shy child, who loved horses, adored corgis, and liked to keep things tidy with a dustpan and brush, she wanted to be a lady living in the country. But a King's abdication and her father's reluctant accession in 1936 brought an end to the idyllic family life spent at 145 Piccadilly in London and the

         in Windsor. Ten-year-old Elizabeth, heir to the throne, was appalled to hear that she would be moving into

         forever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fate thrust a life of duty upon Elizabeth, but to duty Elizabeth would dedicate her life. Only four years later, in 1940, the teenage princess, matured by war, made her first radio broadcast, reassuring evacuated children that all would be well. Indeed, 80 years on, in one of her last broadcasts, she would echo those sentiments of comfort to those isolated and separated by COVID-19. 'We will meet again,' she said.
        </p>
        <p>
         After turning 18, she contributed to the war effort as an army mechanic and learned to drive trucks. Aged just 25 years old, she succeeded her father on the throne, inheriting a shrinking empire and a country trying to carve out a new patriotic identity in the Cold War world. From one young person so much was expected by so many. Elizabeth neither yearned for a return to empire nor sought to reinstate it. She had the strength to venture beyond the safeties of the past, knowing that the path to modernity must be forged differently: her emphasis not on the people serving the monarch, but rather on being a monarch who tirelessly served the people.
        </p>
        <p>
         She set a new course, giving herself, her heart and her soul, to the Commonwealth, to champion, as she described it, 'that equal partnership of nations and races, built on friendship, loyalty and the desire for freedom and peace'. That commitment saw her travel the world. She covered more than 1½ million kilometres, visited more than 100 countries and met many thousands of people and hundreds of leaders. With characteristic humility, she greeted all those she met with courtesy, treated them all as equals and offered an attentive ear.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was, however, Churchill, Reagan, Obama and Mandela who left a lasting impression. She said of the latter, 'The most gracious of men has shown us all how to accept the facts of the past without bitterness.' Her historic trip to the Republic of Ireland in 2011 exemplified that spirit of reconciliation.

         Our sovereign had a deep affection for Australia, visiting on 16 occasions between 1954 and 2011. She opened our new Parliament House and the Sydney

          Commonwealth Games
         </a>
         in Brisbane and in Melbourne, lit the eternal flame at the base of the cenotaph at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance and met construction workers in a tunnel of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. Beyond our capital cities, she visited places in every state and territory:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         and Albany, Dubbo and Devonport, Mackay and Mildura, Tamworth and Townsville, Whyalla and Wollongong and more besides. She looked forward to meeting people from remote locations, who, she said, 'have been such a distinct and enduring part of the Australian way of life'.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Queen would admit that she 'always felt a special bond with a people whose creative energy and collective ambition is leavened by genuine warmth, generosity and humour'. She admired that Australian trait 'to honour those who go about their essential business without fuss or media attention'. But, of course, wherever the Queen went, crowds choked the streets, cheering and clapping and waving flags to express their adoration, as, of course, did Prime Minister Menzies. His fulsome and awkward tribute in 1963, quoting English poet
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ford" rel="nofollow">
          Thomas Ford
         </a>
         , perhaps now strikes a different chord: 'I did but see her passing by, and yet I love her till I die.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Queen Elizabeth lived through the pivotal events of the 20th and 21st centuries: wars and conflicts, depression and recession, decolonisation and independence, the race to the moon and the attainment of civil rights, the brilliance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Olympic Games
         </a>
         and the barbarity of terrorism, the sorrow of natural disasters and the solitude of pandemic. She was a realist and an optimist, stating: 'I have lived long enough to know that things never remain quite the same for very long. The future is, as ever, obscure. The only certainty is that it will present the world with new and daunting problems. But, if we continue to stick to our fundamental ideals, I have every confidence that we can resolve them.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Elizabeth presided over an era of remarkable technological change. In 1983 she reflected:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In the year I was born, radio communication was barely out of its infancy; there was no television; civil aviation had hardly started and space satellites were still in the realm of science fiction. When my Grandfather visited India in 1911, it took three weeks by sea to get there.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Last month I flew back from Delhi to London in a matter of hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nineteen fifty-seven saw her first televised Christmas message. Year after year after that, that inviting, warm and familiar face of our Queen, with her radiant smile, would beam into our living rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most never met her, of course, but felt they knew her. We drew on the wisdom of her words and on the comfort of her voice. As technology evolved, she embraced its changes. As we got to see more of the Queen, we saw more of her cheeky humour and her sense of fun: her joy at the racecourse; her quip at the G7 leaders photo shoot, with her dry sense of humour—'Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?' she said; her Olympics cameo with

         , confessing that she too hid marmalade sandwiches.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite being royal, the Queen was rarely ostentatious. Many of her habits, as we know now, were frugal—eating cornflakes out of Tupperware, turning off lights to save electricity and using two-bar electric heaters instead of lighting grand fireplaces. Like us, she had her own television show favourites:

         and

         . Churchill was right in his assessment: she was 'a lady whom we respect because she is our Queen and whom we love because she is herself'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each year the Queen took a summer break at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle" rel="nofollow">
          Balmoral Castle
         </a>
         in Scotland. There she fleetingly lived out her alternative life as a country lady. Her dedication to duty rarely saw her down tools in paving the royal road of service. Indeed, her service was grounded in regimented routine. Each day she would receive the red box, judiciously going through its contents of briefing papers and legislation. Her diary full of official meetings, engagements or visits would follow. The Queen found joy in reading and responding to correspondence from the public, saying:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Every day hundreds of letters come to my desk, and I make a point of reading as many of them as I possibly can.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I value all these letters for keeping me in touch with your views and opinions …
        </p>
        <p>
         Just as people from all walks of life were inspired by the Queen, so too was she inspired by them. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We hear much of 'public life'—the hurly-burly of Parliament, the media, big business, city life. But for most people their contribution, at whatever age, is made quietly through their local communities … To most of them, service is its own reward.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are all sorts of elements to a free society, but I believe that among the most important is the willingness of ordinary men and women to play a part in the life of their community, rather than confining themselves to their own narrow interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Above all else, what made

          Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
         </a>
         II tick was the importance she placed on family, on faith, on democratic institutions and on values. Those constants permeated throughout her reign, which was characterised, of course, by great change. The Queen saw the family as the focal point of her and our existence, the core of a thriving community. In her duty to country and Commonwealth, Elizabeth did not neglect her responsibilities as a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother, a grandmother or a great-grandmother. Yes, her own life, of course, was not without family controversies and tragedies—her annus horribilis in 1992, Princess Diana's death in 1997 and the losses of her mother and sister in 2002—but, for a Queen admired for her almost transcendent qualities, those events would reinforce just how human she was.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Queen suffered her greatest loss in 2021: the death of her beloved husband, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
          Duke of Edinburgh

         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">
          Prince Philip
         </a>
         . Gone was her 'strength and stay' of all those years, the man she so admired for his irrepressible sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation. In her last Christmas message, the Queen spoke about the joy of family, about death and birth. Her dedication to duty and family was linked with devotion to her God. For Elizabeth, the teachings of Christ and her personal accountability before God provided a framework in which she tried to live her life. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At the centre of our lives … must be the message of caring for others, the message at the heart of Christianity and of all the great religions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Queen spoke often about the good Samaritan parable—how we are all neighbours who depend upon each other, no matter our race, creed or colour, and we all have something to learn from one another, whatever our faith, whatever our background and whether we be young or old, from town or countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout her reign, the Queen recognised that parliamentary democracy was 'a compelling ideal but a fragile institution'. She valued the lessons of history, counselling us to have the good sense to learn from the experience of those who have gone before us. She encouraged us, as the beneficiaries of a remarkable inheritance, to hold on to all the good that had been handed down to us in trust. We remember her profound words of 1957:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The trouble is caused by unthinking people who carelessly throw away ageless ideals as if they were old and outworn machinery.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They would have religion thrown aside, morality in personal and public life made meaningless, honesty counted as foolishness and self-interest set up in place of self-restraint.
        </p>
        <p>
         She stated in 1990:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Nowadays there are all too many causes that press their claims with a loud voice and a strong arm rather than with the language of reason.
        </p>
        <p>
         The record attests to the achievements of the second Elizabethan age. She left the monarchy in a stronger position than the precarious one she inherited. But perhaps Her Majesty's greatest triumph will be a renaissance of the virtues and values she embodied in life, virtues and values which we still admire but which are often wanting in a more retributive, revisionist and self-entitled world today—those of duty, service, sacrifice, fortitude, stoicism, grace, humility, generosity, forgiveness and empathy. May our dearly departed Queen inspire the very best in Australians for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the course of the last fortnight, Australians have been glued to their television sets and to their devices, where they've embraced the recounting of the many interactions that the Queen has had with people in the United Kingdom, here in Australia and, of course, abroad. It is a time to celebrate our connection with our British heritage. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of the

         , a very dear friend of our country and a great ambassador for her own country. The way in which the Prime Minister, the Governor-General and the delegation that they led represented our country in the United Kingdom over the course of the celebration of the Queen's life and the commemoration services that were conducted in London was a great credit to each of them, and a great moment of honour for our country. Today we say with heartfelt gratitude: goodnight to the Queen, may she rest in eternal peace, and long live the King.

          died at her retreat on the Isle of Wight in January 1901, the response across the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
           British Empire
          </a>
          was profound and it was consistent. It was observed that most people had lived their entire lives during her reign and that Queen Victoria had been a constant during a period of unmatched change, defined by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
           Industrial Revolution
          </a>
          and the tremendous developments in technology which it initiated. That change was seen in Australia through Queen Victoria's presence accompanying federation. She died just three weeks after the birth of our nation, and her touch is everywhere. Two states are named after her. Our country's first capital was named after her first
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
           British Prime Minister
          </a>
          , and, in one form or another, there is a memorial to Queen Victoria in every major city in the country. As we think about the events and the response of the last two weeks, with the death of Queen
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I" rel="nofollow">
           Elizabeth I
          </a>
          I, we know there was an earlier expression in those events which occurred more than a century ago. As the Prime Minister rightly observed, it is remarkable to think that, since 1837, in the 185 years hence, the throne has been occupied for more than 70 per cent of that time by just two women.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the death of Queen Victoria, the

          </i>
          , in the north-east of England, reported that, whilst few of its inhabitants had ever seen
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
           Her Majesty
          </a>
          , all knew of her good works. And here's where the comparison starts to differ, because, while Queen Victoria provided that incredible constant of presence, she did so during an era where the public glare was relatively limited. There are no photos of an early Queen Victoria. There are just a few videos which show a grainy image of an older Queen Victoria in the distance, and there is no recording of Queen Victoria's voice which is in existence. And yet those technologies, which emerged during her reign, made the corresponding task of Queen Elizabeth to provide that constant presence, that constancy which has been the handrail for change, a task of a completely different order of magnitude.
         </p>
         <p>
          Queen Elizabeth's coronation was the most watched event on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
           TV
          </a>
          to that point in time. The video which documents the 1954 visit to Australia is regarded to this day as the most important pre-TV footage in Australia's social history. Indeed, on that visit, almost three-quarters of the entire population, over those two months, actually came out to see Queen Elizabeth. Queen Victoria never left Europe. In her 70 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth embarked on 250 official overseas trips to 131 different countries. Her image and her voice are the most seen and most heard of any human in history. It's estimated that during her reign she shook the hands of hundreds of thousands of people—it must be closing in on a million people—and through all that time her presence has been constant and predictable, calm and full of grace. In 70 years she did not put a foot wrong. It is an achievement of public engagement on a gargantuan scale. What it really means is, if you think about the entire history of the kings and queens of England, from 1066 and William the Conqueror right through to the present, Queen Elizabeth, perhaps alongside her namesake, stands right up there as one of the greatest.
         </p>
         <p>
          The essence of her engagement was a comforting reassurance, which was never felt so much as during times of crisis, such as in 1966, during the Aberfan mine disaster in Wales, where a mudslide claimed the lives of 151 people, most of whom were kids. The Queen visited Aberfan eight days after that event, and her presence and her visit gave comfort to grieving parents. Decades later, survivors of that disaster would describe the Queen's visit as a positive and integral part of their experience of that tragedy. In turn, the Queen would say of Aberfan that she was impressed by 'the remarkable fortitude, dignity and indomitable spirit that characterises the people of this village and the surrounding valleys'. After the September 11 attacks, the Queen said to the people of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">

          bushfires in Victoria, the Queen asked to be kept abreast on a daily basis, personally, about the disaster, its aftermath and the government response, and she sought those daily briefings for months after the event. That, accompanied by a contribution that she made to the local
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Red Cross
          </a>
          , gave a sense of connection with the Queen to the people on the fireground. Then, more recently, during the pandemic, her words come with a wisdom of an intelligent mind that has experienced a long life. She said to the world:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          And though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …   …   …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed—and that success will belong to every one of us.
         </p>
         <p>
          During these times of crisis, she was the exhausting focus of attention, and it's worth dwelling on that. To give a moment to shake the hand of a complete stranger was literally the daily routine of the Queen's life, and yet, for the person who received that moment, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To understand that difference and yet to give every time, hour in, hour out; day in, day out; year in, year out, shows an astonishing generosity of spirit and a bigness of heart. She must have been a truly remarkable person.
         </p>
         <p>
          For those who had the opportunity to know her just a little, that has been the consistent testimony. When I was much younger, I had the thrill of having lunch at university with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
           Gough Whitlam
          </a>
          , and of all the topics about which I might have spoken to that great man, we found ourselves talking about the Queen, and he spoke in such glowing terms about how wonderful a person she was. I was really struck by his description, but I was just as struck by the fact that it was Gough Whitlam who was giving the description. His words align with all we've heard spoken about the Queen in the last two weeks. I think it does give something of a sense of why we are experiencing and why there has been such an outpouring of emotion across Australia, irrespective of one's views about our constitutional arrangements, across the Commonwealth and, most particularly, across the United Kingdom.

          Yes, it is about the fact that this is a moment in time, a moment in history. We are, most of us, experiencing an event that we've never seen before and maybe we won't see again, and so, in these moments, there is a natural tendency to walk down an introspective path about our own life's journey—but it's also about the person. It is about her. It is about acknowledging an astonishing life of unparalleled service to others. The Queen was right when she said that grief is the price we pay for love. But, in this instance, grief is also the appreciation, across the breadth of Australia, of a deeply grateful nation. Vale Queen

            National Party of Australia
           </a>
           unites with millions of Australians in sending our heartfelt condolences to the royal family, to whom Her Majesty was a beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.
          </p>
          <p>
           My reflections today will focus largely on the unique role Her Majesty played in the hearts of millions of Australians that live outside our capital cities. Since Her Majesty passed away peacefully at the age of 96, Australia has mourned the loss of a truly exceptional leader, a monarch who had a real, profound and enduring affinity with our regions. Over the past 14 days, we have seen magnificent and powerful tributes in honour of Her Majesty. We have witnessed our nation coming together in the spirit of unity on a scale that has been truly remarkable. We have seen public outpourings of grief and admiration through an avalanche of touching condolences, breathtaking spectacles and solemn beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that Australia shared so much with Her Majesty. Indeed, it was during a visit 16 years ago that she memorably said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           As Queen of Australia, I have always felt a special bond with a people whose creative energy and collective ambition is leavened by genuine warmth, generosity and humour.
          </p>
          <p>
           But that bond gets stronger as we go out to our regions. Throughout her life, regional Australians have celebrated Her Majesty in many different ways. Be it in our town halls, our schools or even our pubs, it is heartwarming that you could be in Mildura, Geraldton or even Whyalla and spy a solitary portrait sitting on a wall. This is often a small, yet strong tribute that can embody a community's sentiment without anything needing to be said at all.
          </p>

           Her Majesty Queen

           </a>
           was a shining light of great hope but also comfort for communities across regional, rural and remote Australia. In the midst of regional Australia's toughest times, Her Majesty provided many messages of support and strength. These efforts showed her true kindness, humanity and leadership. Across the 16 royal visits to Australia, accompanied by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Royal_Highness" rel="nofollow">

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
            Duke of Edinburgh
           </a>
           , Her Majesty graced towns across the regions more than 60 times. In a stunning display of affection for our land, in the incredible royal tour in 1954, the first ever by a reigning monarch, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh called through 35 regional towns, and many of these towns were lucky enough to get a second visit. These occasions took many different formats and held many a different tone. Some of these were showcases and celebrations. Some were deeply sombre ceremonies, marks of respect and remembrance. Yet almost all of these moments were simply a dream come true. They were real-life storybook moments where it did not matter whether you were a small child in

           or a middle-aged bloke in Mackay; this was an opportunity to get a glimpse of or even meet the Queen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Perhaps the greatest testament that Her Majesty will be remembered by the regions, we are left with stories from each of these visits that she was certainly more than engaged with everywhere she went. In my own electorate of Maranoa, Her Majesty went through Cunnamulla and Longreach twice.

           , or 'Outback Dan', as he is commonly known, tells the story of the visit to Camden Park Station in Longreach: 'On 15 April 1970, the Queen arrived in her Rolls-Royce, and it was my dad's job for the day to ensure the driveway leading into Camden Park Station was graded so the Rolls-Royce didn't bottom out.' People came from as far as Roma, Rockhampton and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
            Mount Isa
           </a>
           to attend a luncheon hosted by the matron of the local hospital. The matron sat with the Queen, introducing her to the dignitaries, and over lunch they discussed issues regarding rural women, their lifestyles, the community and what they had been able to pioneer, while
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">
            Prince Philip
           </a>
           mingled with the men. Her Majesty marvelled that it was the only place she'd been to the world where she could actually see 360-degree views without a man-made structure in sight.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the reporters from the travelling media pack thought she'd visit the local pub to ask the locals what the visit meant to them personally, and all they could talk about was the chair that Her Majesty sat in and what they were going to do with it. The chair was nicknamed 'the Throne', and can be found to this day at the homestead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Her Majesty returned to Longreach in 1988, our bicentennial year, to officially open the Australian Stockmans Hall of Fame, just one of the many projects she opened that have meant so much to our communities. But there was one small problem in Longreach: there were only 30 motel rooms. Visitors brought their own swags and tents and simply did what they do best in the outback: they camped out. It's reported more than 12,000 people came to Longreach on that occasion alone.
          </p>

           These are just some of the stories that have been swapped and passed down through generations, and will be for generations to come. They occur right across, throughout and without wonderful regions such as Dubbo, Benalla,

            Swan Hill
           </a>
           , Broome and Cooma. The member for Hinkler recently retold the story of Her Majesty's visit to Bundaberg. Our royal visitors were to spend two hours in Bundaberg, but these two hours captivated the region. There were days upon days of rehearsals that even included intense practice and scrutiny of handshakes. This was also set to be the first time that children would take part in a civic reception in Queensland. As recalled by
           <i>
            Bundaberg Now
           </i>
           , the local newspaper, in the 40 days before the visit it had published 57 articles about the forthcoming event, and the week before her visit the paper published daily hints for residents on how to cope with the whole experience. A full-scale dress rehearsal was held at Bundaberg Showground days before the royal visit and the complete royal reception procedures were run through numerous times until it was faultless.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ten trains arrived in Bundaberg early Thursday morning, from Maryborough, Gympie, Isis, Monto, Kingaroy, Morganville,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Perry" rel="nofollow">
            Mount Perry
           </a>
           and Gladstone, with more than 5,000 people on board, and most had returned home by 9 pm the same night.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the end, over 30,000 people pooled into Bundaberg Showgrounds that day. Legend has it that Her Majesty also took an interest in the making of a certain local tipple and asked the mayor, Fred Buss, if he enjoyed it. The mayor, who was never one to miss an opportunity, replied that he did but that it was too expensive and cost one shilling a nip when it should only cost a penny—because of the excise duty from the federal government. Nothing's changed! Years later Her Majesty's son, our now King
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I" rel="nofollow">

           had been given the heads-up.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were also visits where Her Majesty marvelled at our great regional challenges and the practical innovations that our communities used to overcome them. After all, Her Majesty famously joined the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" rel="nofollow">
            Auxiliary Territorial Service
           </a>
           , learning how to drive and how to service an army truck. In 1963, she visited
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
            Snowy Hydro
           </a>
           and Eucumbene Dam and then went up north to Kununurra and Diversion Dam. In 1970, she visited the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Flying Doctor Service
           </a>
           based in Mount Isa and visited the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa_Mines" rel="nofollow">
            Mount Isa Mines
           </a>
           . But this interest and fondness was not a one-way street; our communities worshipped these occasions. Just about every visit shares a similar picture: usually spacious and comfortable country main streets are flooded with thousands.
          </p>
          <p>
           This fondness is also reflected in our communities through our rural agricultural shows. Entry and participation into these shows has traditionally been a chance to showcase a region's finest for judging as a prize suitable for the Queen. In the member for Riverina's electorate in 1954 Her Majesty attended the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
            Wagga Wagga
           </a>
           agricultural show, observing the woodchopping and wool classing. Yet again, thousands lined the streets, and it's been heralded as Wagga's greatest day. These moments have been preserved by our towns. When Her Majesty visited the member for Capricornia's electorate, there were two chairs made especially elegant, stylish and, of course, looking very comfortable. They were there for them to sit outside the Rockhampton Town Hall. They are now on display at the Rockhampton Museum of Art for all to see.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are countless yarns, and, of course, some of those stories shared might not be entirely true; some that no-one would happen to believe did not in fact happen. That is the beauty of legend and that is the beauty of our regions—that they, the people who make up the very soul and identity of our nation, in their own backyard shared their own unique moment of history with a legend.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Regional Australia
           </a>
           will be devastated by Her Majesty's passing but can take great comfort that she's at peace. Moments in history like this are an occasion for deep reflection, and, as we reflect on Her Majesty's life, what we see is an incredible record of service, sacrifice and accomplishment.
          </p>
          <p>
           As Australians, it's worth remembering how blessed we are to live in a society which is defined by a set of core fundamental principles, which have built our nation into what it is today. Australia is the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Country" rel="nofollow">
            Lucky Country
           </a>
           , and part of that luck has been due to the fact that Her Majesty has been able to reign over us. The stability Her Majesty has provided has improved the lives of many. Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and a free, robust democratic system of government—we owe these values to the United Kingdom and to Her Majesty, who was the proud and living embodiment of them. It is by staying true to these values as Australians that the memory of Queen Elizabeth II will always live in our hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a sad time as we now say our final goodbye, and goodbyes are always hard. As we grieve for Her Majesty, we also say thank you. Thank you for your remarkable leadership, thank you for your immense contribution to our nation and our history, and thank you for your love, loyalty and sacrifice. I would like to finish by quoting a message of condolence that was left in my electorate office in Dalby by Mr Arthur Coutts:

            <p>
             It was not appropriate at the start, when I was moving the procedural motions, to give a speech explaining what the arrangements for the day would be, so I'll do that now so that the House is aware. But I thank the House for allowing that to go through without debate. It was important that the Prime Minister's moving speech be the first speech of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
             This will be the only issue that we deal with today. Speeches are five minutes. The tradition historically has actually only been leaders' speeches given and we finish up quite early, but there has been an understandable wish for extra time from members, and there is a significant number of people who would like to make additional comments. That's why we have gone for a different procedure to what has happened previously, although it's some years since the House has had to use the protocols for an event such as this.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the end of the debate, it will simply be dealt with on the voices and the House will automatically adjourn. There will be no adjournment debate today. I also raise the protocol with respect to which many members will want to make speeches. I suspect more members will be in attendance. There is within the resolution that the House carried earlier today the standard clause that these arrangements can be varied on a motion moved by a minister. No-one should be concerned about that. That is just part of it, as it always is. There is no intention for there to be any further divisions or any quorums or anything like that during the course of the day. I'll just add that, for those members who feel that the leaders' speeches have in fact dealt with the issues that they wanted to raise, that's understood and there is no disrespect from any members who may choose not to make a speech today.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will simply add, on behalf of the people of Watson, my condolences and deepest respect and gratitude for a life of service. I have very early memories of the two great-aunts who raised my father, who had all sorts of views about the United Kingdom, being the

             visited Sydney and always had on display their best fine bone china teacup, which was always known as 'the cup for the Queen' in case she ever popped around. I simply add those comments and join with all members in sending condolences to everybody who is grieving but most specifically those people who have lost a dear member of their family as well. May she rest in peace.

              The passing of Queen

              I is tremendously sad for the world. It is a day many of us simply did not believe would arrive, but sadly arrive it did. The second Elizabethan age encompassed the most significant decades of human history. It's hard for us to fathom the breadth and pace of change throughout the Queen's life. The Queen's reign spanned prime ministers from Winston Churchill, born in 1874, to

             <p>
              The Queen was a bridge between the 19th and 21st centuries, a living connection to the trials of our past. Crowned at just 25 years of age, called by fate to a duty unexpected, she weathered the winds of change. A member of the greatest generation, she lived through the battle to defeat fascism, serving as part of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" rel="nofollow">
               Auxiliary Territorial Service
              </a>
              . She saw the rise and fall of communism and lived through the spectre and prospect of nuclear Armageddon. She held the monarchy through a world rapidly connecting and digitising and led the Commonwealth as it democratised and evolved. In the final years of her reign, she kept her people together throughout a pandemic. For 70 years, she gave unfailing public service to the people of the Commonwealth. Indeed, she discharged her duty with such eloquence, commitment and consistency that we took her presence well and truly for granted.

              The loss of a queen is not merely the loss of a leader, nor simply the loss of a figurehead, because behind that crown was a mother and daughter. Behind the crown was a woman who loved and who lost. Behind the crown was a woman who had fears, who had hopes and who had dreams. We cannot forget: what made Queen
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
               Elizabeth II
              </a>
              remarkable was not her title but who she was. The loss we are speaking about today is not about changing anthems, it's not about changing coins or public holidays and it isn't about proclamations or coronations. In our own Australian way, today we acknowledge the remarkable woman the Queen was.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today is about recognising everything the Queen meant for so many Australians, because, for so many of us, we've lost someone who was a constant companion as we've travelled our own journeys through life. From those yearly Christmas messages of hope to those shared experiences of national commemoration or her consistent concern and attention for those Australians affected by fires, floods and drought, the Queen has been there. She played a starring role in so many of our big national moments, from her first visit in 1954, attended by 70 per cent of Australians, to the opening of the Sydney
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_House" rel="nofollow">

              </a>
              or, indeed, to the inauguration of this very parliament. She's imprinted on our memory.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it was not just those great national moments; it was the many thousands of memories made on her travels across our wide brown land. In my own electorate in 1988, on her first visit to Albury, she was welcomed by the entire town and was to cruise the Murray on the historic paddle steamer
              <i>

              wasn't full enough to transport the vessel. The newspapers carried the headline 'Royals all steamed up with nowhere to go,' paraphrasing Captain Frank Tucker, who also said, 'It's a real pain in the butt, but you can't argue with nature.' We now know the Queen and her husband found these sorts of hiccups quite enjoyable, and I'm glad her visit to Albury would have been a memorable one.

             <p>
              Like so many Australians, my experience with the Queen was a brief glimpse and a short conversation. I met the Queen with my daughter Georgina at a reception held in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
               Great Hall

              of Parliament House in 2011. She was introduced to us by Prime Minister
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
               Julia Gillard
              </a>
              . It was a special moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Queen's commitment to duty never faltered, and it is so fittingly captured by the address she made in April 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, when she said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.
             </p>
             <p>

               </a>
               I's service and contribution to public life is rightly being remembered with appreciation across the world and, indeed, in this place today. Heir to the throne at 10; Queen at 25.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was born four years after
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
                Elizabeth II
               </a>
               was crowned. I grew up in a home where the Queen's picture was cut out of papers and kept. In the sixties and seventies, images of the royal family were everywhere. As a primary school student, we saluted the flag and sang 'God Save the Queen.' I also grew up not being counted as an Australian and not enjoying the same citizenship rights as others did. The monarchy was deeply embedded in the fabric of our popular culture and our identity as a nation.
              </p>
              <p>
               No matter what your personal views, the collective outpouring of emotion in the days since the Queen's passing has been nothing short of remarkable. It clearly reflects the love and respect she inspired and the strong connections she built with people throughout the Commonwealth—indeed, the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               In Aboriginal culture, sorry business is deeply important. Just this week, I have been to two funerals of women of Elizabeth II's generation: Aunty Esther Carol in Sydney on Monday and Aunty Neita Scott in Narromine on Tuesday, two extraordinary women born at a time in this country where they were subject to the horrors of a New South Wales welfare board, which rendered every Aboriginal person a ward of the state. It had total control. Both women grew up on Aboriginal reserves and experienced the yoke of the Welfare Board. But they were women of great determination and courage and, like the Queen, full of grace and dedicated to service.
              </p>
              <p>
               For many Indigenous Australians, the legacy of the monarchy is fraught, a complex, difficult and painful reminder of the impact of colonisation. This week has seen many wrestling with the swirling emotions, as
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Grant" rel="nofollow">
                Stan Grant
               </a>
               has said. But, equally, there are many Aboriginal and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
                Torres Strait Islander
               </a>
               people who have respect for the Queen, especially as a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Queen's relationship with Indigenous Australians reflects both how far we have come and how far we still have to go. In 1954 she visited Shepparton in central Victoria. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorta_Yorta" rel="nofollow">
                Yorta Yorta
               </a>
               people had taken up occupation across what was known as the Flats. It was considered too unsightly for the Queen's eyes, and the people were hidden away. Telling this story now is shocking, but at the time it is what it was.
              </p>
              <p>
               But we have come a long way: the '67 referendum, the Mabo decision, land rights, the apology. And we have still much more work to do—more steps to be taken on the long road to reconciliation, more steps on the road to truth-telling and treaty. Because with each generation we make progress, it is my great hope that the years ahead bring us closer to fulfilling Australia's greatest promise. As the Uluru Statement from the Heart so eloquently states:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first sovereign Nations of the Australian continent and its adjacent islands, and possessed it under our own laws and customs.
              </p>
              <p>
               With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia's nationhood. Perhaps because of our relative powerlessness of the past 200 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people knew the implicit power of the Crown, when
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cooper" rel="nofollow">
                William Cooper

              </p>
              <p>
               The hallmark of Queen Elizabeth is a life of service. She worked to leave the world a better place than she found it through fostering unity and common purpose and by acknowledging those less powerful and less fortunate. In this way, she was so similar to the women like Esther and Neita who lived lives of service that should inspire us all. I believe deeply that
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
                Her Majesty
               </a>
               understood in a very real way the concept of sovereignty never ceded.

                </a>
                for over 70 years. Her face was a fixture of the 20th and 21st centuries. Her face was in our courts, in our parliaments, on our envelopes and on our currency—a feature of our visual landscape. As a human being, she loved horses, she drove a four-wheel drive and, by all reports, she had a wry sense of humour.
               </p>
               <p>
                During her reign, we've seen the decline of what was the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
                 British Empire
                </a>
                . In 1952, when Elizabeth came to power, five years after India was partitioned, the British were fighting against uprisings in Kenya and a coup in Egypt. During her reign, 35 countries which previously had the Queen as head of state became republics. However, the impact of that empire is still felt here and across the world amongst those who suffered the loss of their country, including
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                 First Nations

                people.
               </p>
               <p>
                At the moving ceremony yesterday, the Governor-General made an important acknowledgement. He acknowledged that the response of many First Nations people is shaped by our colonial history and that we have unfinished business. He is right, and we must acknowledge it, as a parliament, too. Also, because the Queen's passing means that we get a new head of state without having any say in the matter, it is absolutely the appropriate time to talk respectfully about whether that is right for us as a country. We can offer our condolences to those grieving her personally while also talking respectfully about what it means for us as a people. Australia has not taken our opportunity to become a republic. Australia still does not have a treaty. Australia's former Prime Minister was once removed by the Queen's representative. And it was only in 1986, less than 40 years ago, that the power of the parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws for Australia was finally terminated. And now the Queen has passed, but, despite her longevity and readily apparent restraint, what she represented has not. Now we have a king. We did not elect this man, nor did we as a people truly consent to being governed by him. We have, respectfully, unfinished business.
               </p>
               <p>
                The head of state of this country should be chosen by the people, for the people and from the people. We should respect the civility with which
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Windsor" rel="nofollow">
                 Elizabeth Windsor
                </a>
                oversaw the drawing down of what was once the British Empire and take the cue to grow up and move out. We must recognise, as our Governor-General said, that people around this country are experiencing this moment in different ways. We must recognise the cultural, structural and institutional ways in which the Crown, which we remain a part of, has oppressed First Nations peoples here and around the world. We must first reach a treaty with our First Nations. Once we have struck a treaty then it will be time for a republic—one based on truth, justice and the inclusion of all.
               </p>
               <p>
                When it comes to our history there is no glory in make-believe, because the pain of colonisation is real. The Queen's true gift was that she allowed and encouraged so many countries to grow up, move out and move on. As

                We aren't supposed to talk about these things this week. We aren't supposed to talk about colonisation, empire, violence, about Aboriginal sovereignty, not even about the republic.

               <p>
                But now is the time to look back honestly and to move forward with courage, grace and humility. We can use this moment to genuinely empower people, to choose our leader, to own up to our past and to forge a future as a country, like so many countries who have embraced their independence. As my colleague Lidia Thorpe said:

                That unity would be more powerful than any King.

                For those close to her, who loved her: we recognise your loss and we pay our respects. But her reign has ended, and now we must, finally, take control of our destiny for the good of all who've lived here, who do live here and who will come to live here in the future.

                 Her Majesty's was a reign that became presumptive upon the abdication of her uncle in 1936. The political and royal goings-on of that year led the future queen to receiving expert tutelage in constitutional history from the Vice-Provost at
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College" rel="nofollow">
                  Eton College
                 </a>
                 . This oft-stated fact is underappreciated for the foundations it established for a queen who was to oversee the unwinding of British colonial rule around the world and who, as she spoke of here at the opening of this Parliament House building, acknowledged the precious nature of democracy. These foundations also enabled an approach by Her Majesty to supporting the Australian polity as an independent nation on the world stage, free to choose its own path but, at the same time, always welcomed as a leader in the Empire and then the

                 </a>
                 . This understanding of the precious nature of democracy no doubt also influenced what we acknowledge as her great life of service through her consistent and energetic support of community groups, local champions, charities, and causes in support of those less well off or afflicted by disaster. For all of this, our nation says thank you.

                 Her Majesty had a very special affection for our Australian defence personnel and veterans. Likewise, our current and ex-serving personnel have always held Her Majesty in the highest esteem, swearing to serve her and resist her enemies. As an example of this special relationship, I'd like to share the experience of Australia's oldest surviving

                 . Keith first met the Queen in 1954 on her first tour of Australia. As a young soldier, he was assigned to Her Majesty, opening doors for her and clearing the way for her as she walked. Keith served in Korea in the 1950s. Then he was deployed to Malaysia and

                 </a>
                 . Soon after, he and his company were attacked. His heroic actions that day, described as 'exceptional personal bravery', earned him a Victoria Cross. He was the fourth and final Australian to earn such an award in the

                 </i>
                 . They met on many more occasions, and the Queen came to describe Keith as an 'old friend'. Keith has described Her Majesty as 'not only a Queen but a royal above royals'. I'm so glad that her old friend was able to bid Her Majesty a final farewell well this week, with Keith attending the Queen's funeral in London alongside his son, as did other Victoria and

                  It's a great pleasure and privilege, in fact, to rise on an occasion which was inevitable and which many of us forlornly hoped would never come.

                   Her Majesty
                  </a>
                  the Queen was unlike any other. The Queen was a great-grandmother whose small stature will forever cast a shadow over the 20th and 21st centuries and beyond. She leaves in her wake a legacy we will never be able to quantify. I vividly recall Her Majesty's visit to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                   Sunshine Coast
                  </a>
                  in 2002, one of 16 trips to Australia during her reign. Flanked by the leaders of over 50 Commonwealth countries, the royal household descended on the Sunshine Coast for the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting" rel="nofollow">
                   Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
                  </a>
                  . Here, at a hidden surfers haven, the Queen gave voice and effect to the historic 2002 Declaration on the Commonwealth in the 21st Century. The declaration committed to eradicating terrorism, fostering cultural diversity and emphasising the Commonwealth as a free association based on democratic ideals. In the wake of 9/11, I remember the constant roar of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
                   RAAF

                  F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets circling above the skies of the Sunshine Coast during the course of those few days. Our world seemed to have changed for the worse. Our world was less secure, less optimistic and much more guarded. And yet, through those days of terrorism and change across the world, the Queen was the Commonwealth's constant guiding light for more than 70 years.

                  Her death stilled a frenzied world and continues to bring us together in both gratitude and grief. In my electorate of Fisher, I've been encouraged by the tributes offered in response to Her Majesty's passing. I think of the students of Buddina State School, with their fantastic paintings of the Queen, her guard and her beloved corgis. I think of the Caloundra

                  Her Majesty's faith in God, which she called her 'bedrock', has been noted in the days since her passing. Her pledge to serve was a lifelong vow to her people before her God. This vow she kept. Whether in

                  on bended knee or enthroned in the House of Lords, it was Her Majesty's example of Christianity, humility and duty which marked this second Elizabethan age.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And it really was a defining era. In the face of devastating disasters and the darkness of war and terror, Her Majesty inspired unity, forgiveness and national pride. In our throwaway culture, Her Majesty inspired reverence for ancient tradition. In a world expanding at what she described as 'a bewildering pace', the Queen called for greater compassion and connection with one another. The Queen could draw crowds of millions. In fact, as many as four billion are said to have watched Her Majesty's funeral. Yet, in the same way, Her Majesty inspired families, streets and community groups to join together in intimate celebration of every wedding, anniversary and jubilee. Her faith and her faithfulness, her service and her selflessness have anchored our nation, and our family of nations, through thick and thin. Our Queen was a constant in moments of national reckoning and global change. She saw 16 Australian prime ministers and 16 governors-general.

                  In closing, I want to share a piece of advice offered by Her Majesty not too long ago. In her 2021 Christmas address, the Queen said:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Adults, when weighed down with worries, sometimes fail to see the joy in simple things …
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Today we may find the joy in the simple faith and service of Elizabeth the great. On behalf of the people of the electorate of Fisher, on the Sunshine Coast, I offer the royal family my heartfelt condolences. May God keep her and grant her peace, and may God save the King.

                  <p>
                   I begin with a story about an encounter from
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" rel="nofollow">
                    Buckingham Palace
                   </a>
                   . Madeleine Buchner, a local from Melbourne, received a call in 2016 to say that she was to meet Queen Elizabeth. Madeleine was given the honour after being accepted into the 2017 Queen's Young Leaders program. From Madeleine's own experiences growing up as a carer for her brother and her mum, Madeleine saw the need to support other carers, and she tried to fill that need. She created an organisation called Little Dreamers. Little Dreamers supports people who provide unpaid care for a family member affected by disability, chronic or mental illness, addiction or frail age. And so Madeleine set off to meet the Queen. After 10 days in London, the finale of the Queen's Young Leaders program was a gathering at
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
                    Her Majesty
                   </a>
                   's residence. After almost two hours of etiquette lessons, Madeleine entered the famous ballroom at Buckingham Palace. With a touch of elegant fanfare, the Queen walked into the room with
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry" rel="nofollow">
                    Prince Harry
                   </a>
                   . Harry, being almost six feet two, was easily seen by the crowd, but, because Her Majesty was only five foot four, Madeleine could only see the royal monarch's head bobbing along above the crowd. Despite not being properly able to see her, Madeleine said the room changed immediately after her entrance, and then the encounter happened that changed Madeleine's life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm reliably told that, despite the Queen meeting hundreds of people that day, for the few moments she spent with Madeleine, the Queen was in the moment, entirely present. The Queen asked Madeleine about what she does and why she does it. Madeleine spoke about her organisation, Little Dreamers, about her brother and about her mum. Then the Queen gave her some royal advice; the Queen said: 'It's incredible, turning a challenge into something that changes lives.' And then the Queen instructed her to keep going. The advice from the Queen gave Madeleine the confidence to trust her instincts and pursue her passion, which is exactly what Maddy did. She quit her job and poured everything into Little Dreamers, and it now partners with state and federal governments and literally changes thousands of lives every year.

                   As we pay our respects to an extraordinary life, the passage of the Crown has passed on. As one life ends, her position and considerable privilege is automatically passed on to her heir and her son, our new King. Birth gives him the Crown, the role as the head of the realm, and here lies the complexity of today's stories. We acknowledge the personal greatness of an individual who served with dignity and distinction, but I think it's okay to say that we begin the journey away from the institution that I don't think represents the modern aspects of a democracy that we can aspire to be. Power shouldn't be given by birth; it should only be given by the people. So today I pay my respects to a remarkable person while holding firm the belief that across our great nation young boys and girls should grow up knowing that they could one day serve our country as the head of Australia, that they could serve with intellect, dignity and warmth, just as Queen

                    During her 70 years on the throne, Her Majesty undertook significant patronages of various organisations. I particularly admired Her Majesty's philanthropic endeavours.

                    in Melbourne, under the Howard government. I actually took my mother along. So many senior Australians admired the Queen through their younger lives and have books and magazines in her honour. Again, during my time with Victoria Police, when I was directing traffic in St Kilda Road, I had the great honour of seeing her go by very late at night.

                    This brings me to the efforts of the showcase—if I can call it that—and the services provided during her funeral, where I saw 10,000 police officers on duty, in London's biggest police operation, with 1,650 military personnel in the coffin procession of Her Majesty, and 142

                     We talk a lot in this place about service—in the past few years often about the frontline workers who have protected us and shielded us and served us in the face of fires and floods, and, in the teeth of the pandemic, nurses, teachers, bus drivers, truck drivers, firefighters, the

                     , cleaners, supermarket workers, doctors, pharmacists and a multitude of volunteers. Service comes in many forms. And, in all of the commentary since the passing of the Queen, it's the one word that consistently rings out. She was a woman who was not necessarily destined to be Queen, but, standing here at the end of a 70-year reign, it is difficult to imagine her not being there. The Queen was a constant in most of our lives. She reigned for more than half the life of this Federation. Winston Churchill was born in 1874;

                     was born in 1975—101 years apart. Both were her prime ministers. That gives you an idea of the sweep of time and the generations through which she lived. Throughout all that time, in good times and not so good, the defining feature of it all was service. You don't have to be a monarchist to admire that, just a human being.

                     In 1980 the Queen visited my local community in Bankstown. She came to declare it a city and she left impressions that have lasted till this day. It was a really big deal. Thousands lined the route from

                     s and universities that the Queen visited in her 16 visits to Australia. It's a long list—everywhere from Broome state school to Bourke Primary School, from

                     in Hobart to the School of the Air in Alice. She talked to students over the phone and she listened to their speeches. And they came to her, in their thousands, everywhere she went. She visited apprentices in dockyards in Newcastle and workshops in Melbourne. She visited teachers' colleges from Wollongong to Townsville, opened the medical school at the University of New South Wales and had a buffet lunch with female students at the

                     The Queen understood the power of education and wanted to see it for herself, and, with her passing, she becomes the lesson—a life dedicated unflinchingly to duty, to family, to faith and to the service of others. For all of us here who aspire to serve others, that is a life well lived. May

Unfortunately I was not the member of parliament at that time, so I couldn't convince them to stop in Penrith, but the train did slow as it passed through Penrith station and the memories of the Queen waving to the citizens of Penrith have lasted a lifetime. When I spoke to volunteers at the Penrith hospital auxiliary at their 90th anniversary just last week, it was quite extraordinary how many people had in fact been there on that occasion and waved to the Queen. For those who met the Queen in person, their stories that lasted a lifetime were quite profound in the impact that she had on their lives.

It is this level of service and dedication to service that I would like to speak about today.

                      <p>
                       The Queen was a truly remarkable person. For me, as a young fella growing up in the country, it was really the face on our coins that was my relationship with the Queen, as it was for so many young Australians. You were doing your jobs or your chores, you were getting some coins, and there was her face. I never met her, but you didn't need to meet her to understand that she was a remarkable person, and we have seen her now mourned by hundreds of millions of people, including millions of Australians, since the news of her passing.

                       I want to start by telling a quick story from one of my constituents, Harry Barnett. We were chatting down the pub the other night—the Buff Club in Darwin—and he told me about his encounter with the Queen. He grew up in Melbourne, and it was arranged for him as a nine- or 10-year-old boy—he can't quite remember—to meet
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
                        Her Majesty
                       </a>
                       . So he'd been rehearsing quite a bit, and his role was to say: 'Good morning,
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your" rel="nofollow">
                        Your
                       </a>
                       Majesty. Welcome to Australia. I hope you are enjoying your time here.' But Harry then says: 'I looked at her, and she was so beautiful, and I got it wrong, so I ended up saying: 'G'day, Mrs Queen. How ya going?' And he had this sense as a young man that he had done wrong, but he says the Queen gave him a wry little smile, patted him on the head and said, 'What a delightful young man.' Harry got a medal for meeting the Queen and for doing his duty. Harry's mum, who still lives in Melbourne, is in her 90s now, and she has Harry's medal. With all due respects, Mrs Barnett, Harry wants his medal back!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So, with my duty done to pass on Harry's message, I just want to reflect on her comments, quoted by the Prime Minister and so many others, which ring so true in these days that we live in, and that is, 'Grief is the price we pay for love.' It's such a poignant remark and observation of life.

                       Reflecting back to her coronation in 1953, there were over 7,000 Australians and 250 Australian military personnel who took part in the Queen's coronation. We saw again members of our armed services go over recently to the Queen's funeral. I pay my respects to the Queen for her own military service. She joined the war effort in

                       </a>
                       as a truck driver and as a mechanic when that was not required of her by her station in life as a royal. Thirty years after that coronation, Her Majesty came to Darwin to open the Larrakeyah naval base. Ten years later, 40 years after her coronation, I received my Queen's commission as an Army officer, when I was posted to the 3rd Battalion of the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>
                       . To receive a Queen's commission means that you are granted the authority to lead Australian soldiers. It's an incredibly great honour. So, on behalf of all those in my electorate, the people of Darwin and Palmerston who miss her greatly, and on behalf of all those who were so proud to serve her when they served in the Australian military with her as the Queen, I simply say:

                        The young princess ascended to the throne in 1952 at the age of just 25. Prior to her death, at 96 years of age, she was the oldest monarch in the world and had reigned for more than 70 years—longer than any British monarch in history. A truly remarkable story and a truly remarkable life. Queen Elizabeth was the monarch to 14 countries, in addition to the United Kingdom, and she was also head of the Commonwealth, which consists of 54 nations today. During her speech to mark her 21st birthday in 1947, Queen Elizabeth declared that her whole life, whether it be long or short, would be devoted to the service of her subjects across the Commonwealth—a vow, we've all recognised in this place, that she held through to her passing. During her record-breaking reign, the Queen visited 117 countries and clocked up more than 1.5 million kilometres. That's the equivalent of 42 trips around the world. The Queen was a frequent visitor to Australia from her first visit in 1954, when she also became the first and so far only reigning monarch to set foot on our soil.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        There were two things I found amazing about this tour. The first was the number of places the Queen visited with her husband,
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Royal_Highness" rel="nofollow">
                         His Royal Highness

                        </a>
                        . They visited 57 towns and cities in just 58 days, in a time and age when transport was nowhere near as easy and simple as it is today. They traversed the country by plane, train, ship and car, from Cairns in the north to
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">

                        </a>
                        in the west and Hobart in the south. An estimated three-quarters of the Australian population turned out to see the then 27-year-old monarch. Admittedly, our population in 1954 was just under nine million, but it was an incredible figure nonetheless. But it was the subsequent visits, 16 in all over the years, that brought home to Australians right across this country the importance that the Queen placed in Australia and the joy she had whenever she visited here. During many of those stays, she came to my home state of Queensland. She visited Queensland eight times and visited our national capital some 14 times.

                       <p>
                        Due to the longevity of her reign, the advances in travel—in particular air travel—the breadth of the domain and the frequency of her trips, the Queen probably met more people than any other monarch or person in history. It's interesting to reflect on the number of people that she came across in her reign and, importantly, the number of leaders that she outserved—14

                       </p>
                       <p>
                        As we mourn her passing, there are already plans underway to erect a permanent memorial to the Queen on the Gold Coast, and the mayor has indicated he's going to invite

                         News reports have covered anecdotes about the Queen's sense of fun and ability to laugh at herself, which in recent years have been more properly celebrated, and it was because the Queen was willing to showcase this herself. The opening of the 2012

I provide the deepest condolences to her family, who have lost a special mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, and I also offer condolences from the people of Werriwa to the UK and the Commonwealth. The Queen's service and leadership were constants that did not waver during her life. On behalf of myself and the constituents of Werriwa, may Queen

Not only does her passing mark a significant moment in history; it is also a marker for the passing of a generation to whom we owe a great deal. It is the generation sometimes referred to as the greatest generation—that is, the generation that confronted and defeated evil on a grand scale in Europe and the Pacific. It is the generation that put service before self, that put the greater good ahead of individual gain—which is not to say that consequent generations have not done the same. We see demonstrations of selflessness and service and constancy all around us every day in our communities, but it was the challenge of the global conflict of

                           on the eve of her coronation in June 1953. Hundreds of thousands of people, like my dad, filled London on that summer day in June 1953 to catch a glimpse and be part of a momentous event. That commitment and dedication was replicated last week, nearly 70 years later, as we all watched the queue in all its British magnificence and then the crowds that gathered in their hundreds of thousands to say farewell.

                           In my home state of WA, Her Majesty is regarded with unique affection, and, in particular, in Brand, which enjoys a high proportion of migrants from the United Kingdom and all Commonwealth nations. She was the first reigning monarch to set foot on Australian soil and visited Western Australia on seven occasions, with engagements stretching from Kununurra to Albany. She made her first visit to Perth with

On Cactus Island, in an particular episode known as 'Off with His Head', when the prime minister of Cactus Island particularly annoyed Queen Bessie of Buckinghuge Palace, she was disappointed not to have the same powers as previous monarchs. The character said:

                            Of course, Her Majesty was a visitor to Australia many times. In fact, the 1954 visit to Bundaberg is recalled still by many, including my father, Trevor, who attended as a 10-year-old and was in the stands. He came over in a bus from the Childers school to see the Queen. Some 30,000 people were at the showground, an estimated 10,000 at the airport and another 10,000 on the street. It was quite incredible—absolutely incredible.

We were informed in no uncertain terms that the then Prince Charles would not be speaking at the event and that he would participate in the mixing and blending of rum at the Bundaberg rum distillery, which is still, to the best of my knowledge, one of the biggest events worldwide on the internet and everywhere else. But he got such a rousing reception when his departure came up that he, unprompted, gave a speech, if I recall correctly, of about 20 seconds. He said: 'I know the Australian spirit and character is such that you are unbelievably resilient and somehow you manage, regardless of what happens. That is one of the great characteristics that I've always admired ever since I first came here 52 years ago. Don't change. You are just as wonderful.'

                             that someone gave me. I also have some lovely Charles and Di royal wedding glasses from 1981, although it's best we don't dwell on those! It may seem quite incongruous to those who know me that I have such a collection, but it was handed down from my grandmother to my mother and from my mum to me. It's certainly not unique. I know others who have such ephemera and, like me, are not quite sure what to do with them. It seems a bit wrong to throw them out, although we have no real purpose for them in the modern age. But such was the magic of the monarchy for so many Australians over so many years that people like my mum collected trinkets commemorating royal occasions and milestones. Last week some friends were over, all republicans, but we got the royal glasses out to have a little toast to the Queen and a life well lived.

                             or colonialism, or the Queen or the King's role in the dismissal or whatever else some may try to make it today. It's a motion of condolence to recognise a truly remarkable life well lived and the passing of Australia's head of state. Whatever the different views people may hold on constitutional monarchy, Her Majesty was Australia's head of state for over 70 years. Almost all Australians have never known any other sovereign. She reigned for well over half of the length of our Federation. Indeed, she is the only British monarch and therefore the only Australian head of state ever to have actually visited Australia, and she did so 16 times. Some 70 per cent of Australia's population at the time were said to have seen her in 1954 on her first tour. She reigned always in accordance with the values of the oath that she took to serve the people of Australia and the Commonwealth. We should acknowledge that with respect and gratitude. Hers was a remarkable role model of service and, as was aptly said yesterday, servant leadership. The crown fell upon her head when she was just 25 years old. She fulfilled her duties with dignity, grace, never a hint of personal scandal and always in the public interest.

                             Elizabeth II was a constant figure across so much of the world for the better part of a century. With her passing ends an era, the so-called second Elizabethan age. You won't find speeches from me lauding the coming of the so-called third Carolean era or singing or chanting the British national anthem, but Elizabeth was an icon of an age, of generations, for Britain, our nation and the world.

                             <p>
                              It's a great honour and privilege for me to speak today on behalf of the people of the Parkes electorate, an electorate that covers half of New South Wales and an area that had a great affection for the Queen. Over the last week or so, we've seen a farewell to a monarch that was years in the planning and executed to perfection—something that was rehearsed and practised. What wasn't rehearsed was the outpouring of emotion and feeling from billions of people around the globe.

                             <p>
                              My own response on hearing, early that morning, of the Queen's passing—even though somewhat inevitable, at 96 years of age—was to feel an emotional impact. That emotional impact was felt right across Australia, the Commonwealth and, indeed, the globe.

                              where she spoke to patients via the radio at the Broken Hill base, all those years ago; and her visit to Dubbo, where many people came in from right across western New South Wales to meet with her. There was her visit to the town of Bourke, and people who were students at Bourke's school have that fond memory of actually meeting and seeing the Queen up close for the first time. Even her family has visited:

                             <p>
                              I just want to reflect on a story my mother used to tell. In 1954, as a very young schoolteacher at Warialda, she was in charge of a busload of students going to Casino, over on the coast, to see the Queen. They boarded Louis Kratz's school bus—a very rudimentary form of transport, even by that standard—and, on a gravel road over the
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range" rel="nofollow">

                              , travelled through the night. Most of the kids, on a very hot and humid night, were carsick. They got there, to join thousands at Casino, saw the Queen pass by, piled on the bus and drove through the next night to go home again. And that was the response in 1954, when 70 per cent of Australia's population actually saw the Queen at first hand.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              So there's the personal connection to the Queen. But there's also what she symbolises: stability, decency, a sense of duty, family, commitment to marriage—all of those things that we admire, as Australians, she embodied.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              It is the end of an era. The people of the Parkes electorate certainly have been mourning the loss of their Queen. Probably the most recent connection was when last year's

But it was her passion for racing that stayed the course throughout her life. It was a rare outlet in which she had the opportunity to revel in competition and enjoy the spoils of sport. Her Majesty said:

It was only earlier this month that a horse owned by the Queen, Chalk Stream, ran in her famous colours at Royal Randwick. Sadly, that will be the last time that purple, gold braid, scarlet sleeves, black velvet cap and gold fringe will be carried by a horse in an Australian horse race. But that connection will continue not just in Randwick but in our broader community and beyond.

                                I is mourned throughout the world not only for who she was but for what she represented: a set of values that are as important today as at any time in our history. First, the Queen represented the ideals of monarchy, encompassing values of duty, service, honour, dignity, tradition, continuity and stability, of grandeur yet understatement and leadership beyond politics.

                                Third, the Queen represented the wartime generation, and that is why losing the Queen is like losing a beloved grandmother. In a sense, she was everybody's grandmother. She was a living link to that greatest generation which put country before self—a generation whose values of service, modesty, dignity and thrift helped reshape the postwar world for the better; a generation that prevailed through depression and war to rebuild the world with hope and optimism. We have, in a sense, lost our anchor to that world and those values and find ourselves adrift, bobbing like a cork on the sea.

                                The Queen's generation projected a sense of moral clarity less observed today. It was a generation in which fewer people were formally educated, and yet seemed wiser; a generation, in

                                , Australia and the Commonwealth, that stood alone against the tyranny of Nazism; a generation in which commitment to faith was the norm; and a generation which had more in common with each other because of the shared privations of depression and war. That common experience was shared by the Queen and her family remaining in London during the blitz. As the Queen Mother famously said, 'The children won't go without me, I won't leave without the King, and the King will never leave.' The strength of George VI in those days—not a strongman like the European dictators but a man of character—set an example that inspired people across the globe. The stoicism of the royal family during the war represented a gritty British spirit and never-say-die attitude shared by Australians. Those, then, are the values that we mourn and the generation that we've lost, represented by the Queen.

It's hard for us to imagine what it must be like at age 10 to have a responsibility like the Crown thrust upon you—to have no choice in the matter and to do that job for the rest of your life, right up until the day you die. It makes the Queen's flawless service even more extraordinary. In her 21st-birthday broadcast she said, 'My whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.' It was a promise that she kept till the end.

Along the way to get to the hospital, she drove through local streets, where residents and businesses had spent time and money on beautification, and thousands of schoolchildren were organised to line the route. There was, apparently, some last-minute consternation when it was proposed that, instead of driving this route, the Queen catch the train for this section of this journey. In fact, the

                                 I have to thank the Heidelberg Historical Society for putting all of that information together. Over the past week, I have really enjoyed following the public comments on the historical society's Facebook page about this visit, because there are so many locals who remember that day and who have shared their memories. Many of them were schoolchildren at the time, and there's a repeated theme in the comments of shoes being shined and socks being pulled up before their parents allowed them to come and stand by the roadside to wave at the royal cars passing by. Many of the comments also claimed to have been the recipient of a wave back. Whether or not that actually happened, I think it's about the memory that was created. There's a warmth and respect in these comments from those who were there that demonstrates how all those people felt that sense of occasion that the Queen brought, of being part of a moment in history, just as today there is a sense of history in us marking this solemn occasion, the death of the only monarch most of us have known.

                                 Of course, history isn't just one story and it isn't just one emotion. I do want to acknowledge that these are not universal sentiments and we must find a place in our national conversation for other sentiments as well. Today we are truly marking the end of an era, the close of the second Elizabethan age. We do so with deep respect and warm regard for Her Majesty's life of service. May she rest in eternal peace.

                                  . I acknowledge the many fine contributions of those in this House that have preceded mine and will follow mine. With duty, dignity, dedication, service, strength, courage, compassion, grace, humility and love, Her Majesty was one who served, when so many others might have sought to be served in such a role. She was a rock. She was a constant for the Commonwealth as

                                  . But I think, more than that, she was a rock and a constant in so many people's lives. She was something that didn't change in a world that changed every minute of every day. From that, people found the strength and the fortitude to carry on in the worst of times and to celebrate in the best.

                                  What, do we ask, enables someone, in Her Majesty, to live such a life? What sustained her in this service and sacrifice? This is what I want to reflect on today. Many have told stories, and I welcome those; I could tell them also. But what I want to focus on is what I believe sustained Her Majesty in all of this. She answered the question herself in her many Christmas messages, which I've taken the time to go back over and read. By her own confession, it was her deep and abiding faith in

                                  that she so often referenced in those messages. Most recently, in 2014 she said:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">

                                  In 2002—and the Leader of the Opposition made reference to this—in what was one of her most difficult years, having lost her mother and her sister, she must have felt, apart from having Philip with her, so alone. She said this in her Christmas message:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  I know just how much I rely on my own faith to guide me through the good times and the bad … and put my trust in God.
                                 </p>

                                  It says in 2 Samuel what I think is the best description of Her Majesty's reign:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  … who rules righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is like the light of the morning as the sun rises. A morning without clouds, when the fresh grass springs out of the earth from sunshine after rain.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  That was a testimony to Her Majesty's reign.

                                  So, as a grateful nation, we do give thanks, and so many from all of our constituencies right across the country have done that, as have mine in the electorate of Cook in the Sutherland shire and St George area.

Her first visit to Tasmania was on her first visit to the nation, in 1954. That visit included Hobart, Wynyard, Burnie, Devonport, Latrobe and Cressy. She certainly got around my island home. During this visit, she met with many thousands of Tasmanians who came out to see her. She opened a session of our state parliament. She met with some troops, greeted schoolchildren, planted a tree, and, of course, had many official lunches, dinners, receptions and afternoon teas.

She went to see the apple industry there—the grading, the packing and the shipping of the apples that Tasmania was once famous for; we were known then as the Apple Isle. The visit also included more official events, as always happens. She visited on more occasions, in 1977 and 1981, and in 1988 for the bicentenary. Her last visit to Tasmania was in the year 2000. Her Majesty was always sure of a warm welcome from the Tasmanian people, and she was always accompanied—on every visit—by the Duke of Edinburgh,

                                   With Tasmanians mourning her death and reminiscing about her visits to Tasmania, I've heard many stories about interactions where she was thoughtful, kind and inquisitive about our island home. Some people in the electorate and elsewhere in Tasmania even sent me copies of their personal memorabilia from their times and visits with the Queen. I've been sent a lovely photo of the Queen meeting school students in 1981. But I've also got a lovely story from a veteran broadcaster who, during Her Majesty's 1970 visit, was a 22-year-old cadet who had a little incident. The story from Ric Patterson goes:

Just in the last three years, we've had well over a hundred constituents get that letter that so many people wait for. I know that many Tasmanians have acknowledged her death in many different ways, depending on the circumstances, with some of them reflecting on how our nation has come to where we are today.

                                   Her service to her nation and to the Commonwealth is unparalleled. A 70-year reign is unlikely to be repeated. She has the privilege of being the longest reigning monarch in British history, and of course she truly gave her all right to the very end. As Britons and others across the globe mourn her death, they rejoice in her reign and they acknowledge her leadership. Queen was not a role that she was born into initially, but of course one she took on with a sense of duty to uphold the institution that became her life's work. Stepping into this role at such an early age would have been daunting, but she just got on with it. In the seven decades of her reign, there have been many changes, but she remained steadfast as

                                    A little over a month ago I was speaking to the assembly at Boronia Heights Primary School as we officially opened the ring of trees planted around the oval to mark the Queen's jubilee. I said to the children that the trees and the accompanying new seating were to honour and to recognise one of the most remarkable people of the last century and that, hopefully, in years to come, children will sit on the marked chairs and reflect on who she was and her incredible service. Today, with the Queen's passing, I have no doubt that this will occur, as it will occur at the hundreds of existing monuments to

We were largely monocultural. Television had not even come to our shores. Today the world is so different, with the internet, globalisation, modern multicultural society and alternative powers.

Through all seven decades, she practised and exemplified a constant set of values: of faith, of stoicism, of grace and humility, of duty above self, of love of country and above all of service literally until her dying days. And these values did not deviate over seven decades.

Is it not just because of the loss of an incredible servant leader but because of the potential loss of the values that she represented—the official passing of an age, the official cutting of the last link to our greatest generation. I hope our fears are not realised, and perhaps the reflections occurring today and at monuments of Queen Elizabeth in the future will cause us actually to be more like her. I'm sure her son, King

                                    I, the Queen's father, on 7 February 1952, in this very place Prime Minister Menzies said of the newly crowned 25-year-old:

                                    As she goes through her sorrow to her great responsibilities it would be the wish of all of us to say to her that we have faith in her ; that … we are resolved to do all that we may to make her reign as rich and kind and good and memorable as that of her illustrious father.
                                   </p>

                                    That faith was more than warranted. Her reign was richer than anyone could have possibly imagined. I thank Queen Elizabeth for her service. May she rest in peace.

                                     I. The people of Canberra offer our deepest condolences to the royal family on the loss of a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Her remarkable life of service and unwavering dedication to duty has been truly inspirational, and certainly I and, I think, many of us reflect with some awe on the experience of a young woman at the age of 25, following the death of her own father, taking on such a great responsibility and duty, and then to hold that responsibility and fulfil it with grace, dignity and respect for all people that she encountered every day until her death at the age of 96.

In Australia her long and record-breaking reign spanned 16 separate Australian prime ministers, and 16 governors-general served in her name. For 70 years she remained steadfast, a rare and reassuring constant in a rapidly changing and at times uncertain world. For most Australians, she was the only monarch we have ever known. The Queen visited Australia 16 times between 1954 and 2011, visiting every state and territory. She opened the Sydney

Her appearances were always met with adoring crowds cheering, clapping and taking photographs in a show of affection.

As a result, she holds a special place in the history of my electorate and the national capital. She visited Parliament House, both old and new, on eight occasions and opened the federal parliament three times, including in 1977, the year of her

                                      In the spirit of Queen Elizabeth's humour in that regard, I'm sure the House wouldn't mind me recounting what a constituent of mine told me had happened on the Saturday morning when her family woke up to the front page of the paper with a large photo of the Queen due to her passing. The lady's little boy excitedly pointed to the photo and said: 'Mummy, she's famous. That lady's famous. She's met Paddington Bear!' This is the sort of humour that you can picture Queen Elizabeth herself appreciating. Indeed, she was able to therefore appeal to and move with the times.

                                      For me, that was a reflection of an innate humility that she possessed as a human being—a humility that said, despite being born into a royal family and despite being the sovereign of so many nations, including our own, she recognised the need to change and to adjust. It was a humility that was also reflected in her style of leadership. For her, she did not have a job to execute but a vocation to live—a vocation of service. But, so much as Queen Elizabeth II may have indeed moved with the times, that's not to suggest she ever swayed from her core values—values that included the importance of family and the importance of faith.

                                      On a personal level, as I think of her passing—and over and above the role that she has had in our world and in our country—I think of her own values of family and faith. I celebrate the thought of her being reunited with her love in heaven,

In 1982, she was 19 years old and worked in hospital admissions. She tells me that the Queen's visit was a huge day for the community and made her feel like her work at the hospital mattered. Her Majesty was a figurehead that allowed people to reflect on their own role in the community. Within her years of dedicated service, many people could see a purpose for their own contributions.

The passing of Her Majesty has brought to the fore varied emotion and thought. I think we can acknowledge—we're big enough to acknowledge—that the weight of matters past can be remembered and should be responded to, and we can also know that choices about our future direction can be considered in the future.

                                        It's estimated that, over her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth undertook more than 21,000 official engagements, averaging around 300 a year. Even in the last few years, as age and a global pandemic challenged this heavy workload,

                                        I, in February 1952, Her Majesty visited Australia on 16 occasions, with our island state proudly hosting Queen Elizabeth seven times: in 1954, 1963, 1970, 1977, 1981, 1988 and 2000. At the time of her first visit to Tasmania with

                                        and back again. The visit to northern Tasmania capped off the end of a four-day visit to the state, and I couldn't help but have a laugh when I read the editorial in the local paper after the visit, which somewhat sulkily stated:
                                       </p>
                                       <p class="italic">
                                        … but now that the Queen has gone it can be said emphatically that the basis of allocation of time between Hobart and the rest of the state was most unjust to the majority of the people of Tasmania.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        This snippet of the editorial proves that the north-south parochial wars were alive and well even back then.
                                       </p>

                                        As we've witnessed in the weeks since Her Majesty's passing, there are so many in communities across Australia who have stories to tell of seeing the Queen or, if lucky, having an opportunity to chat with her during an official engagement. Northern Tasmania's Professor Nigel Forteath recently spoke of his role in guiding the Queen during her tour of what was then the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology's aquaculture centre in 1988. He recalls that Her Majesty was very interested in the animals at the centre:
                                       </p>
                                       <p class="italic">
                                        We went to where we had all kinds of fish and aquatic life, and at nearly every tank she had something to ask and enquired the whole time about things. She was interested in everything we were doing, which made it so easy.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        Professor Forteath went on to share an amusing anecdote from the end of the tour:
                                       </p>
                                       <p class="italic">
                                        We went into the area where we kept trout and I remember I told one of the students that when the Queen comes in to feed the trout, so she could see them all splashing around on the surface. Unfortunately the student waited until the Queen was horribly close to the tank and threw in some pellets and the trout went berserk. The Queen nearly jumped out of her skin I think, and moved backwards, so I felt a bit embarrassed … she took it all in her stride. She was just so good at relaxing you, and that's what I remember most.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        Much has been said, and will continue to be said, about Her Majesty's life, and, at the end of the day, there are a range of views and feelings about what the monarchy represents. As I've reflected on these sentiments over the past few weeks, I've also been reflecting on an incredible reign that we'll not see again for generations to come. My thoughts have always come back to her dedication to a life of service. As she famously said in a radio broadcast even before taking the throne: 'I declare before you all that all my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.'
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        It's this declaration that sticks in my mind as I think about that poignant moment that has stuck with me in recent years, and that's the Queen sitting alone in

                                        at the funeral of Prince Philip last year. On that day, despite her immense privilege, Her Majesty was simply somebody's mother or grandmother mourning the loss of the love of her life. Despite being offered otherwise, she'd refused to bend the COVID restrictions that the entire UK was enduring at that moment. In solidarity with so many who were saying goodbye to loved ones, and with just a few family members, the Queen sat alone as she said goodbye to her love of 73 years.

Her lifetime of service is evident of a dedication to upholding the principles of constitutional government across the realm and in this country, in particular. I could continue to go on, but I would like to just close in saying: rest in eternal peace, Queen, and God save the King. Thank you.

                                          I, like many others in Australia, woke to the news that Her Majesty had passed with a significant level of sadness because for me, as for many people across Australia, she had been the only sovereign during my lifetime. And, as I reflected on it even more, I realised that, in my lifetime, I will never, ever see another reigning queen, because the line of succession is all male at the moment. I make no remark on that other than to say that I will never see another reigning queen during my own lifetime.

                                          By recognising that, I was able to put in place what Her Majesty's life had meant to me when I was growing up as a young girl in Townsville in

                                          . I remember that the first time that I saw the Queen was when she was driving along the Strand in Townsville. Many of the schoolchildren had the opportunity to go down to the Strand just to see her drive past. It was the most fleeting of glimpses, but I have never, ever forgotten that. I subsequently made a journey into the heart of Brisbane some years later to see her when she was there. Whilst I certainly didn't get very close to her, I remember seeing her at a distance and the fact that there were so many people who were gathered on the streets in Brisbane at that time to be able to see her.

                                          I also recall some comments that my mother had made to me, and I think she makes these remarks almost annually to me and my sister. She remembers very fondly when the Queen and

                                          were in Brisbane some time before that, and she actually threw a rose to Prince Philip. She claims that it landed in the car. It may well have; I accept my mother's view of what happened then. I remember when I actually did get to meet the Queen and Prince Philip, when they were here at Parliament House in 2011. I spoke to Prince Philip and said, 'My mother threw a rose to you when you visited Brisbane all those years ago.' He looked at me and said, 'Did she really, or are you just saying that?' and I said, 'No, she really did.' Interestingly, I've always had a very high regard for Prince Philip because sometimes, when I look at him, I see my own father. They have quite an uncanny physical resemblance, and, when I read the reports about Prince Philip, I am reminded of my own father.

                                          The day I met the Queen was a tremendous honour for me. I felt very proud to be able to meet her. When I look at the final stages of her life, there are some things that really stand out to me. One is the image of her on her own in the church at Prince Philip's funeral. I think that we all recognised how sad it must be losing a partner of so many years and not being able to sit directly beside your own loved ones and share that so intimately. The other image that comes to mind is the image of her when she met the incoming Prime Minister,

                                           Queen Elizabeth was there in the background through most of our lives. She was there as we moved from black and white into colour, from the white Australia policy to our great multicultural presence. After 70 years with her at the centre of public life, we all caught a glimpse of this passage of time and the long arc of our shared lives together, because the world has changed so much in the 70 years of this reign. Under her watch, the

The Queen understood the enormous changes that were happening all around her, and she didn't struggle against them as a different leader might have. She appreciated the strict line between her duties as a constitutional monarch and the prerogatives of democracy.

When I first became the member for Sydney, I was visiting the high-rise flats there in Waterloo and I met some of the residents who were there when the Queen visited in 1977, including residents who had welcomed her into their home. I can tell you no-one had forgotten that day. That was a day that really lived with them and stayed with them.

                                           The Queen respected our independence as a nation but always cared deeply about the welfare of Australians. Beneath all the protocol and decorum, there was a rich humanity. She enjoyed a great romance with Philip—as many have said, the love of her life—to whom she was married for more than 70 years. She was a proud mother and—I think this is important—a proud working mother and grandmother and great-grandmother. I think one of the reasons that so many Australians followed her life and her progress and her work so closely was because they related to elements of that life, particularly her love and support for her family. I know—we were talking earlier—my own mother grew up in the then Yugoslavia. She was probably the Queen's biggest fan in Australia, and it was about her dignity, her years of service and her loyalty to her family.

                                            , the longest reigning monarch in British history, brought the world to a standstill. As the news of Her Majesty's passing reached the nations, a deep sense of loss and reflection settled across the world. There was comfort in knowing Queen Elizabeth II in her final hours was surrounded by her family, whom she loved so deeply, and was at peace in her favourite home,

                                            Her extraordinary, selfless commitment to duty and service over her 70-year reign was both impeccable and historic. The grace and dignity she displayed in the face of the many public and personal challenges she faced during her reign served as an example and an inspiration to us all. The gracious, generous commitment she gave to the leadership of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the royal family was extraordinary. Has there been such an outpouring of grief at the passing of a monarch? We will remember her for her compassion, kindness, humility, faith and endearing smile. These qualities have touched us all and are testament to the decent human being she was.

Many on the New South Wales North Coast are mourning her loss intensely, a loss of a constant and reassuring presence in all of our lives, one who was a source of comfort and familiarity against the backdrop of an ever-changing world.

These contributions include a deep appreciation for the kindness shown by the Queen whenever Australia fell into crisis, such as floods, bushfires, the pandemic—all of which my electorate has felt acutely. I'd share some of the sentiments shared by some of the community in the condolence book. From a very young child:

It was because of this that the Queen was always a champion of defence forces right across the Commonwealth. She often met with ex-service personnel wherever she visited. In honouring the Queen's dedication to our armed forces, I, of course, pay tribute to all the veterans in my electorate of Richmond.

There is, indeed, comfort to be found in Her Majesty's own words: 'Grief is the price we pay for love.' Now is also the time to send our thoughts to

                                              In the days since Her Majesty's passing, I've met with so many locals, most of whom won't mind the description 'well seasoned', who still remember that day with some fondness and excitement. At the Goombungee Q

I had been at the hall to replace the portrait of the Queen, something that hadn't been done, judging by her youthful appearance in the picture, since at least the 1980s. There would be very few monarchs or leaders who have had their portraits replaced so often. I can assure the House the ladies of the

                                              As the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, Her Majesty was very much a country lady at heart and nowhere more than in a CWA hall, which she genuinely loved and respected. In both the blink of an eye and the long, hard grind of a 70-year reign, Her Majesty went from someone handwaving in a passing car to somebody we all felt an extraordinary attachment to. It wasn't just the length of her reign or the relentless workload she undertook but rather the manner in which she performed her role that let her into our hearts.

                                              My generation saw her deal with the more universal issues that we recognise in our own lives, those of family breakdown and personal loss. I pause to remember the contribution of her late husband, the

But those of Mr Voll's generation I think saw her greater work, that of her early years, the slow welding together of the then still new Commonwealth. It was and is a beautiful concept, a union not of Crown possessions but of nations that share the desire to treat each other with the grace, dignity, compassion and respect with which Her Majesty treated all she met. It is an idea that dwarfs that of empire, making something even better from the last strains of its long coda.

                                              in Toowoomba we saw a great reminder of how just how full a chord that idea of Commonwealth struck. Amongst the packed crowd, representatives of many Commonwealth nations came forward and laid wreaths from their home countries. It was not only a great display of Her Majesty's success in building the Commonwealth but also a demonstration of the Toowoomba region's wholehearted embrace of it. How could the Queen have imagined during her first visit to Toowoomba that at the end of her reign that small country town would be a city filled with people from all corners of the Earth, Her Majesty's vast vision of Commonwealth played out so beautifully in regional Australia.

                                              In praising the Queen's extraordinary vigour, leadership and vision, I wish also to speak to her more ordinary traits. She may well have been the greatest leader of her time. Even in the company of Churchill, Roosevelt and Mandela those words ring true. But it is on her connection to us, the everyman and everywoman, that she is most dearly remembered. It would not take too much imagination to see her cheering on her ponies as they came up the long hill and towards the final straight at Clifford Park or to see her letting her corgis off the leash at

There is some analogy there to the triumph of will and determination over our physical bounds that I think speaks well to the British spirit.

However, for me, I now feel a sense of hope that has followed my time of mourning because the traits Her Majesty has been so celebrated for are not just valued by those of her generation or mine; her traits of dignity, respect, service, grace and humility are very much valued by our younger generations, too.

The Queen's Christmas message was on television at my grandmother's house every year. Through her, I developed a profound respect for Queen

As a Wren, my grandmother took to her duty to act as a driver for the admiralty. This was dangerous work and exposed my grandmother to situations many women were at the time heavily shielded from. When she finished her shift, she would jump on her bike and ride home through the streets of London, through sirens, shelling and air raids. During those tumultuous years of war, she took risks that were a first for many women in dedicating their lives to service and country.

Then a princess, she was the first female British royal to actively serve in the British armed forces, and I believe this resonated with my grandmother and, of course, other wartime women who had chosen to make the same sacrifices. It was the Queen's humanity at the time that endeared her to and inspired those for whom she would become Queen for 70 years.

                                               Queen Elizabeth connected with people across the Commonwealth whenever she could, and it was during her visit to Australia in 2011 that I had my own chance to meet her. On that occasion, I relayed the story of my grandmother's service as a Wren, her life as a war bride and her emigrating to Australia to be with my grandfather, following the war. It was sad that I couldn't reflect sharing that story with the Queen back to my grandmother, as she had already passed, because I know she would have been incredibly proud. But it was the Queen's response to my story—one that she'd obviously heard countless times—that was incredibly endearing and even a little amusing. She told me it was 'a common story'. Now, I'm sure it was the nature of the times she was referring to, as the British colonies were taking on more and more resettling of those fleeing war-ravaged Europe and

                                               , but I did chuckle at the use of the word 'common'. It did also resonate with me, though, that Queen Elizabeth II was from a different world to that of my grandmother, but the Queen radiated a down-to-earth authenticity that connected her to so many people, including commoners like my grandmother.

Photos show young boys and girls lining the streets, waving Australian flags and being greeted with obvious warmth by the Queen, who waved and smiled back. These types of connections were formed for generations of women and men from all over the world, as she continued to meet with them throughout her 70-year reign.

For so much of history monarchs have derived their power and authority from that idea, that idea of divine right, that, anointed by God, their rule is legitimate. But this was always a structure of power with the deep flaw of placing all power in the hands of, and at the whim of, one single human ruler. Indeed, even at a time when all-powerful kings reigned supreme, the Bible goes on to tell us that this could never work very well. Even Solomon, in all of his renowned wisdom, erred, exceeded his power and was punished by God.

History teaches us that it was the British who, from

                                                Constitutional monarchy is rightly the inheritance of every single Australian. And what a success it has been. Like in the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy has given Australia unprecedented freedom, political stability and the means of managing crises that have seen other modern political systems break and their societies dissolve. In just our short time in the history of the world, we have paradoxically become one of the oldest continuous democratic societies in the world today. By limiting the power of our of head of state, our Queen or King, by strictly defining the use and limitations of their power, we've answered well that central question of good political structure that has plagued so many and continues to confront so many societies today.

                                                I we have the exemplar of the success of our model of government, a queen who perfectly understood her role in our Constitution and did her duty every single second of every single hour of every single day of her 70-year reign, the second-longest reign of a monarch in all human history, a sovereign who held absolute power under our Constitution for all of that time but never wielded it or sought to wield it, except under the strictly agreed terms as defined between the ruler and the ruled. For Australia, she so elegantly represented our nation and was loved by us, and in return loved us as a people—the first and only reigning monarch to visit Australia, who went on to visit us 16 times.

                                                It is astonishing to think of the debt that we owe our Queen. This amazing woman served as our sovereign, perfectly, for 70 years. Never once did she express an opinion outside of her role, nor breach her duty, nor give us cause for concern. And, in a modern world, with tabloids, paparazzi, the loss of privacy, this is a truly remarkable thing. Her sacrifice of her individuality her entire life to serve us is a perfect service that will forever dominate our nation's destiny.

Proper political structure matters, and constitutional monarchy remains one of the best-ever devised protections against abuses of power, and we should not change it.

Her Majesty touched the lives of so many people. I think it's also fair to say that we've been getting a history lesson in royal protocol. After all, it's been 70 years since Queen Elizabeth II's own father, King

Most people, myself included, have known no other queen as head of the Commonwealth. For a young queen in a male-dominated world to help steer that change over 70 years as Queen truly was extraordinary. The Queen saw wars, pandemics, the introduction of technology such as the internet, changes in the workplace—the list goes on. Through it all, the Queen was always there, a steadying force.

                                                 On her 21st birthday, the Queen said, 'I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service,' and that's just what Her Majesty did. What we are seeing now is an outpouring of recognition of the dignity with which Her Majesty navigated all of life's ups and downs.

Instead, she gave life and energy to the Commonwealth—to what she called 'an equal partnership of nations and races' that was built on 'friendship, loyalty and the desire for freedom and peace'. Australia is a proud member of that Commonwealth, and we were glad to call her our Queen.

The crown came to her much earlier than she imagined, along with the painful grief as she mourned the early passing of her father, King

A lesser woman might have chafed at the imposition so early in life, but she gave herself to the institution and became the leader that we came to know—that ever-present benevolence that was never far from our thoughts: her visage on our coins and $5 notes; her photo hanging on walls in government buildings and defence barracks across the country; the loyal toasts at countless dinners over the years.

She would often say, 'Imagine if the Queen was here,' and we'd sit up and eat in a more dignified manner. And her presence was generational, too. My children sat transfixed, recently, watching on

                                                  She did touch our lives in many ways—not as a celebrity, but as a woman who lived out her calling with Christian grace, humility and quiet strength. She lived those virtues as our Queen, in her private role as guidance counsellor to prime ministers and in her public leadership of the Commonwealth. In both ways, she touched the great and small alike with her example of service. It is right that we should mourn her—for her life of duty and service, and because we may not see her like for another thousand years. May she rest in eternal peace in the comfort of her lord and God. And may God save the King,

Here, and right around the world, there has been a grief which has been universal and democratic in nature. Citizens who take little interest in politics have stopped to watch the melancholic pageantry of the Queen's funeral. The grief in Australians—the sense of our irrevocable loss, our awareness of permanent change—is not explained simply by the longevity of her reign.

The fact that a person such as myself may be a committed believer in an Australian head of state should not prevent us from recognising the greatness inherent in the person of

                                                   expertly located the Queen's broader cultural relevance in a century where the self was 'privatised' and the public good 'broadly neglected'. He noted:

                                                  <p class="italic">
                                                   Queen Elizabeth understood this and instinctively attached herself to the public good against what she recognised as a tidal wave of private interest and private reward. And she did this for a lifetime. Never deviating.
                                                  </p>

                                                   The quiet Queen never embraced partisanship, which allowed her to be the constitutional monarch for all, regardless of creed, colour or conviction—a head of state for all. This silence should not be mistaken for disinterest but rather is an acute wisdom that the role of head of state is to unite, even as nations change and governments change direction. Such purposeful unity enabled the diverse nations of our Commonwealth the time and space to evolve national identity. History salutes strong leaders who accumulate power, but leaders who disperse power are infinitely rarer. In recent weeks, we've lost two of that rarer kind in former Soviet leader

                                                   and, now, the Queen. Australians should just pause for a moment and reflect that the Queen oversaw the transformation of the British Empire into a multicultural Commonwealth of more than one billion people. In this great room of Australia where we gather, we should all take a moment to reflect on the particular grandeur of this great woman and Queen. May she rest in peace. The Queen was a figure of constancy, not a partisan nor an activist, and that is at the heart of the public's affection for her.
                                                  </p>

                                                   The supreme irony is that the Queen is the exemplar of the type of personality—humble, dutiful, thoughtful and abiding—that Australians would want in an Australian head of state. The Queen never embraced partisanship, which allowed her to be a monarch for all. She never ignored the realities of shifting social norms. She did indeed acknowledge after the 1999 referendum that it had been clear for some time that, in her own words, 'many Australians' wanted to see constitutional change. She stressed, though, that the future of the monarchy in Australia was for the Australian people alone to decide, while reassuring us that, whatever happened, it would not change her family's 'deep affection for Australia and Australians everywhere'. That discussion will happen in other times. That change will happen in other times. But, with Her Majesty's indulgence, we take a breath to reflect on the end of the second Elizabethan era and with it the profound loss of a great woman.

Through the peaks and valleys of war and peace, through the darkest days and in times of triumph, in a rapidly changing world, she was a reassuring presence of continuity and calm. She was a 25-year-old who became the longest-reigning monarch in British history and, for many, was the most loved. As we mourn her passing, country communities have come together across our electorate of Calare to share memories of when the Queen swapped the comforts of

                                                    On the first of the Queen's 16 visits to Australia, in 1954, the royals visited 57 towns and cities in 58 days, including two in the region that I'm lucky enough to call home. On 12 February the royal flight touched down at Raglan Aerodrome, and the Queen said g'day to Bathurst for the very first time. In the 1954 census, Bathurst had just over 16,000 residents, so you can imagine the pandemonium as the city's population swelled five times over, with an estimated 90,000 people gathering in the city's CBD to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty. That's about the same number of motor racing fans that descend on

According to former detective Superintendent Cliff McHardy, a large wooden log was placed over the train tracks at Bowenfels, near Lithgow, in an attempt to derail the train carrying the royals. The advancing train struck the log, but, fortunately, it was travelling slowly enough that it didn't derail. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the public were unaware anything had happened for three decades, before the

Her presence and support in times of tragedy and loss will never be forgotten.

He spent a lot of time researching the monarch's responsibility in constitutional government.

                                                     Harold Wilson had his first meeting with her, he was embarrassed to discover that she understood the current political issues confronting him better than he did because she had always diligently worked through her briefs, in his government and in prior governments across her reign. He vowed never to go unprepared to another meeting with her. Dr Greenwood noted that the Queen championed the Commonwealth's interests across the decades, when British prime ministers seemed obsessed with Europe. While for many she embodied the dignity and grace we might expect of a British monarch, history tells us these traits are not necessarily inherited with or imbued within the Crown.

She provided reassurance in the aftermath of natural disasters and at times of concern for Queenslanders, sending messages of strength and support. On her final visit to Queensland in October 2011, Her Majesty paid tribute to the resilience and courage of Queenslanders in the aftermath of floods and cyclones. Her subsequent public walk along Brisbane's South Bank was greeted by thousands of Queenslanders, emphasising the great affection with which she was held in Queensland.

                                                      enacted a title and then, in 1973, Gough Whitlam thought that it needed to be updated. It needed to be updated because that title needed to divorce state from church. It also needed to give primacy to the Queen's sovereign rule of Australia.

But not only did she agree; she wanted to be the person who signed the act, here in Australia, in 1973, when she visited for the opening of the Sydney

She did it because she understood the primacy of democracy, the importance of democracy, and she also understood that as sovereign she needed to obey the will of the Australian people. It also showed her humour, because at the lunch, after the signing of that act, one Australian rather impolitely said to her, 'Congratulations on becoming naturalised,

                                                      The Queen left a mark that I think no other world leader will ever leave on Australia. When she visited the electorate of Wannon in 1954 she went to Hamilton, then a population of 5,000. Seventy thousand people came to Hamilton that day to see the Queen. The people of Portland were so upset that they weren't included in the visit that they complained bitterly. That old rivalry between towns was alive, well and truly, then. So what did Her Majesty do? In 1970 she visited Portland. It just shows how she knew and understood this nation and wanted to make sure that she represented everyone she possibly could.

                                                      Her sense of dignity, her sense of duty, her sense of service, in many ways, epitomises what is so great about our own nation. Every time you see fire, floods or cyclones, what is it that we are reminded of? It's that sense of service, that sense of giving to others, that sense that self is not as important as giving to those around us. She led us in that, and she epitomised it in every act she undertook over 70 years of service.

There were 16 visits. She opened parliament twice; state parliaments, five times. She officially opened Parliament House, this building, in 1988. During her first royal tour, in 1954, she travelled some 16,000 kilometres by air—33 separate flights—and made 207 separate trips in the car, visiting more than 70 country towns. That included Northam, Kalgoorlie and Perth in

                                                        Queen Elizabeth II was a bastion of strength, calm and pride for many Australians. 'Our Lizzie' was relatable as a wife, a mother and a grandmother who appeared to add Queen to her list of titles with warm affection rather than stuffy superiority. While it was ever clear that she took on her role with the solemnity and gravity it deserved, she did so with an approachable smile and a kindly, considered word. At the time of her ascension, her steady, calm presence gave Australians exactly what was needed as we emerged from the chaotic postwar period. While the process of establishing what is today known as the Commonwealth began in the late 19th century, it fell to Queen Elizabeth II to guide its acceleration. She oversaw a process in which the

Coffs was quite a different place 52 years ago, and many in my electorate recall the thrill they felt upon hearing the Queen would visit what was then a small, modest seaside town. Many felt her visit put us on the map, and they remember how proud they felt to show off our beauty to royalty. The Queen had that effect on Australians. We wanted to show off our country, our culture, our natural beauty and—let's face it—our far superior weather. She possessed a motherly symbolism that we wanted to impress and, in wanting her to experience our country fondly, we found ourselves showcasing and appreciating all the things that make Australia great and of which we should be proud.

On 9 September the Australian people woke to the news that the Queen's historic reign and her long life devoted to duty, family, faith and service had come to an end. From the moment the young princess became Queen in 1952, Her Majesty's dedication to duty and service over self was the hallmark of her reign, and she performed her responsibilities with fidelity, integrity and respect for everyone she met. We saw those qualities each time she visited our shores, which she did on 16 separate occasions, travelling to every state and territory across our vast continent. She visited my electorate of Newcastle on four occasions: in 1954, 1970 and 1977—when she came to open our Newcastle Art Gallery, which I got to witness firsthand—and then again in 1988.

She inherited a monarchy whose political power had been steadily eroding since the 18th century but whose role in public life was, paradoxically, to increase in its importance. She handled her often difficult and delicate constitutional role with grace and, it must be said, remarkable political skill. Perhaps nowhere was that more evident than in the way in which the Queen engaged with Australia, our contested histories of colonisation, the unfinished business of a just and proper relationship with our

                                                         Over the course of seven decades, Her Majesty observed closely the evolution of former colonies, the emergence of independent nation-states and the formation of new alliances and new political power. Yet she remained welcome and a constant presence throughout the Commonwealth. She embodied and exhibited a timeless decency and an enduring calm.

I expect that experience of working within a traditionally male-dominated workplace held Her Majesty and millions of other women in good stead for what was yet to come. Despite those women surrendering their jobs, voluntarily or not, to the men who returned from war, the world of work and the work of women were destined to change for ever. It's just taken a lot longer than we might have expected.

For 70 years she embodied leadership. She showed generations of women and men that women can be leaders; indeed, women are more than capable of leadership.

Throughout her reign, Queen Elizabeth showed a deep affection for our nation, and she was held in high regard by most Australians too. Notwithstanding her lifelong dedicated service to others, the passing of the Queen has reignited questions and conversations about our nationhood and our constitutional arrangements. These are conversations that are a sign of a healthy, mature nation and should not for one moment take away from the very important business of wishing the Queen and her family peace at this difficult time.

Many here have spoken about how they had the opportunity, and indeed the honour, to meet the Queen. I never met the Queen but, I must say, the one thing that stands out to me, upon hearing from people who have met her, was not so much the honour of meeting Her Majesty—for indeed it would have been an honour—but the fact that it was an experience in human connection and that Her Majesty greeted a Prime Minister and a member of parliament with the same deference with which she greeted any man or person or woman in the street.

                                                           In 2022, the vast majority of Australians—around 88 per cent, in fact—have only ever known Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen. Reflecting on my life as a migrant child in Australia, hardly speaking any English, one of the first things that we learned at school was how to sing 'God Save the Queen'. When my family took the oath of allegiance to Australia in taking Australian citizenship in 1974, I watched on as my parents also sang 'God Save the Queen'. Indeed, that theme of constancy has been one that has come out quite profoundly during all the speeches that we've heard here in this chamber today and over the past 14 days of commemoration for the passing of Her Majesty.

                                                           She has been a source of strength and a source of comfort for many in uncertain and changing times. Many speakers before me have said, in much more eloquent words, just how much of a comfort she was in those various times during her reign.

Having a head of state who chooses not to exercise power is something we should cherish, because there will always be a long list of interests wanting the exercise of power. Queen Elizabeth lived and breathed her duty and was rarely tempted to go out on a limb and engage in anything political. She also brought stability to a changing nation and a changing world, and for that the world is a better place.

Like the Queen, she was heavily influenced by the ravages of the Depression and the two world wars and revered the simplest things in life: family, faith, service and simple food. She served the Queen lamb chops, followed by tinned peaches and ice cream for dessert. By all accounts, that simple home-cooked meal—an Australian dinner in a very traditional Australian home on a hill in Cooma, a meal many of us in rural Australia were brought up on—was gratefully received by both the Queen and Prince Philip. My grandmother's reverence for the Queen was bolstered by what she saw of her on that visit. Each Christmas, she would demand we all watch the Queen's Christmas broadcast and stand in the living room to sing 'God Save the Queen'.

Perhaps what we are seeing now is some rediscovery of the virtue and values of that remarkable generation, a generation who saw unprecedented adversity and tumultuous change.

I've heard many in our community, young and old, comment that she has been the Queen for all their lives. She has always been there, and she's been a great comfort to many, the one constant in an ever-changing world. She was the Queen for our parents, our grandparents and even our great-grandparents. Her 70-year reign was without a doubt an amazing achievement. She was the longest-serving monarch in British history.

After providing a daily brief to the palace for three months, the Victorian government thought that we were past the worst of it and could stop sending such frequent updates. Two days later, the Premier received another message, saying that

One lady told us about a certificate she received as a three-year-old, in London, at the time of the coronation. Eileen Buckley of Kilmore and her five-year-old sister from Holberton Gardens,

                                                             , were among the many children in London who received a certificate for participating in local celebrations to mark the coronation. Eileen recalled it was a time of great celebration, with streets holding their own parties, decorated with red, white and blue bunting, and children dressing up as royals for the day.

Eileen and her husband came to Australia in 1972 and later became Australian citizens. There was a portrait of the Queen for their citizenship ceremony. When Eileen became a justice of the peace, the Queen was there too. In fact, images of the Queen were at the most significant events in her life.

                                                             Many people have come in and written of their sincere gratitude to the Queen for her years of service, for being an enduring constant in their life and for the profound sense of loss they feel. In fact, the words 'profound sense of loss' are repeated time and time again in the condolence book. They talk about the sense of connection the Queen gave Australia to a bigger family, the 'incredible and enduring mark' she left on the world and her dedication to lifelong service, and 'an amazing monarch that we will not see again'. There is no doubt that many people have a great deal of regard for her and are grateful for the respect, calm and resilience she embodied.

She took the crown at a time when the

                                                              was in terminal decline and oversaw its transformation into a Commonwealth of, largely, independent states.

                                                              Her coronation was for many people the first television program they would ever watch, while every single moment of her funeral was documented on social media. The world changed and Elizabeth changed. But it felt as if she was entirely unchanging. That is because she remained true to her values. People felt they understood her. They knew who she was and what she was about. I think this is what people want from their leaders. They want someone who knows themselves, who knows what they believe in, and someone who will stand by their principles their entire careers and lives.

                                                              A second thing we can take from the Queen's life is that she took her responsibilities and commitments seriously. She made a pledge on her 21st birthday that her whole life would be devoted to the service of her people, a pledge that she recommitted to on her coronation day and a pledge that she honoured for seven long decades. She honoured that commitment. It seemed that all her days were devoted to meeting people from all walks of life, celebrating their achievements, raising the profile of those who supported others, and offering comfort and support to those in hardship.

                                                              This devotion to service was best demonstrated through her work with the Commonwealth, which has supported democratic values, human rights and the rule of law in member states throughout her reign. She took her responsibilities and her commitments seriously and she honoured them for every day of her life. It is clear to me that this is what people want, what they and what others value in their leaders. That is why there's so much respect for Elizabeth. As the Prime Minister said this morning, 'You could be a republican and still have a deep affection and respect for her.' I think people in all walks of life, certainly in Wentworth, acknowledge the stability that her reign has provided our own democracy, even as many consider how our democracy may change.

                                                              was a remarkable woman, one who was respected and admired by so many Australians for so many reasons. I'm deeply honoured to be representing the people of Wentworth as I say, 'Thank you for a full life of devoted service.' I would like to finish with a brief note from one of the constituents who left a condolence in my office. They're simple words, but I think it is well expressed: 'Sincere condolences. Thank you for your lifetime of service and duty. Always loved and missed.'

The royal tour brought our country to a standstill, with some 70 per cent of the population flocking to witness a young and energetic Queen. Her Majesty touched many hearts on that tour, including people in my community. I've often remarked that

Crowds of Blacktown residents lined the Western rail line to catch a glimpse of their new sovereign. Despite the long trip, Her Majesty remained steadfast, standing at the rear of the final carriage to smile and greet many Australians. This is how many would remember their Queen—steadfast in her duty, unwavering and resolute. Images from this visit pay great tribute to a sovereign who maintained the same energy throughout her whole life and into her final years.

Queen Elizabeth was comfortable with all people. There was a generosity and warmth in all she did, and it is evident in those photos as she graciously walked the crowds gathered to witness the historic event. The people of Western Sydney loved their Queen.

Many, including myself, will miss the familiarity that came with Her Majesty's reign as the only sovereign I and many others had known for our entire lives. We will miss the comfort of Her Majesty's Christmas broadcasts and the wisdom imparted by the Crown. Above all else, we will miss a sovereign who showed a deep admiration and abiding respect for Australia, that unique island nation on the other side of the globe which so many before her had overlooked as just another colony, yet one Her Majesty lovingly embraced as part of the Commonwealth family and celebrated as an independent nation with its own sovereignty.

While we knew that this day would inevitably come, our nation has still felt a tremendous sadness and a sense of great personal loss. I wish to express the condolences and the gratitude of my community to our late sovereign. My office has been inundated with calls from local households keen to receive a portrait of the late Queen for their own commemoration. They have expressed to me their deep sorrow at her passing and their appreciation of her untiring service.

Queen Elizabeth performed a difficult task over a difficult period, always with immense grace, warmth and compassion. She was the epitome of a servant leader. This approach was reflective of her Christian faith, which was such an important part of her life and her character. The photographs that have gone around the world of Her Majesty performing her final duty in the days before her passing will come to symbolise her virtues for years to come. She overcame her declining health to invite her final Prime Minister to form a new government. You get a strong sense from the image that nothing was going to stop her from performing this final official act. Despite her frailty, she was dutiful to the very end.

When the first Queen Elizabeth addressed her troops, assembled to see off the Spanish invasion of 1588, she remarked, 'I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and the stomach of a king, and a king of England, too.' Well, our Queen Elizabeth had a heart for her realms that was more than a match of that of any historic king.

It is right that her subjects in the United Kingdom are referring to this period as a second Elizabethan age, but for her Australian subjects this has been our first Elizabethan age, mirroring the national flourishing experienced in England during the reign of first Elizabeth.

Over the course of her 16 visits to our country, she saw Australia come of age, shifting from postwar austerity to a nation of unrivalled prosperity and promise. She was a constant in the lives of Australians, a symbol of permanency and steadiness despite all the change that our nation has seen over the seven decades since her coronation.

It gives me a great sense of pride that my grandfather was there at the start of Australia's relationship with Her Majesty and that, 70 years on, I had the privilege of swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth and her heirs and successors at the start of this 47th Parliament. While this is just one small personal connection, it is reflective of so many private stories that have been shared with me by my constituents over the last few weeks—small recollections of her amazing reign, memories of Her Majesty's triumphant tour in 1954, well wishes exchanged when she opened Brisbane's World Expo 88, and anecdotes that illustrate her sincere love for our country and her concern for our welfare in times of trial.

Over the last couple of weeks, we have witnessed the most heartfelt outpouring of grief from across the country and across the world. She leaves behind an unmatchable legacy of selfless service and will stand as an inspiration for years to come. As we mourn the passing of Her Majesty, I thank God for blessing our family of nations with a sovereign of such remarkable character, and I send the best wishes of my community to our new king as he takes on this heavy responsibility at a time of such monumental personal grief. May Her late Majesty rest in eternal peace, and may God save the King.

Unusually, the weather that day was not good. However, it was well reported that the Queen ignored concerns about the weather and insisted her visit proceed as planned.

She was so committed to seeing the people that she ended up being 22 minutes late to the Williamtown aerodrome, as it was logged. She was met there by the president of Port Stephens shire, Councillor Shearman, and Mrs Shearman; the commandant of Williamtown aerodrome, Group Captain Davis, and Mrs Davis; and the Minister for Lands, Mr Hawkins, and Mrs Hawkins.

They had been delighted with the welcome that they had received from so many schoolchildren and were sorry that they couldn't have stayed longer. Queen Elizabeth, with Prince Philip, her consort, by her side, was truly a gracious and committed monarch. Many in my electorate based in the magnificent Hunter region of New South Wales share Her Majesty's love of horses and how these majestic creatures enhance our lives. Her early love of riding continued right up until she was 90 years old. This is truly extraordinary, and anyone who rides will tell you that riding side-saddle is another skill altogether.

While it's said that three-quarters of Australia came out to visit the Queen in 1954, many of us alive today have never met her, but I think we all feel that we knew her, whether it was through watching the Christmas messages or staring at portraits in our soldiers memorial halls or seeing her face on our coins and notes.

Mark Seymour Walsh shared his memories of the Queen and Prince Philip in their 1954 tour. He was just a young child, living in Renmark at the time, but he remembers the red, white and blue ribbons; the bunting; the rosettes; the flags, and he remembers the huge crowds. He said:

The February 1986 expo was a world first in that the perpetual trophy was presented for Best of Breed Welsh Corgi Pembroke. This trophy was a personal gesture by Her Majesty in memory of the late Mrs Thelma Gray, an Adelaide Hills resident, corgi breeder and friend of the Queen.

It cannot be imposed and It is only too easily destroyed. It needs the positive dedication of the people as a whole, and of their elected representatives, to make it work.

We've had more than 80 people sign the condolence book, and just today Mount Barker Primary School dropped off their condolence messages. I'd just like to share a couple. Betty wrote of the Queen:

It's clear that we have a nation in grief, and I think the way that's being expressed in the parliament is really doing justice to how our constituents are feeling about this particular time.
                                                                    </p>

Like all of you and all of your constituents, they have experienced an outpouring of grief about the death of the monarch. It's come to me through emails and phone calls. People have stopped me in the street or in the supermarket to talk to me about this matter, and I can see that my community is feeling the need to talk about the Queen. There's a real sense, I think, that we all knew the passing of the monarch was inevitable but it also has been so shocking for it to happen. The Queen has been the monarch for my entire life and for the entire life of, I think, every member of this parliament. When I was born, the Queen had already been on the throne for almost 30 years. So, yes, we knew that she was going to pass, and it was inevitable that it would happen, but the shock has really, I think, struck everyone in my community.
                                                                    </p>

                                                                     Something that I think isn't always well understood is the level of regard and respect that the monarch held amongst many migrant communities in our country. I have one of the most multicultural electorates in Australia. More than half of my constituents were born overseas. A lot of the people that I represent in this parliament come from countries which are violent, repressive and unstable. This is a community of people that could not place more value on a stable democracy, and for a lot of these communities the monarch was the ultimate representation of that. I just want to express, on behalf of the many community groups that have come to me to reflect that, that we're very much standing with them in the difficult time that we're experiencing.
                                                                    </p>

I've been thinking about the way that I was introduced to some of these ideas and remembering that the Queen first came into my orbit with a story that my mother told me continually when I was a child. She talked to me about what the royal family had done during the Blitz when London was being bombed. Many of you will know that the then Queen was told to leave London for her own safety and for the safety of her family, but she wouldn't do that because she didn't want to take herself out of that dangerous situation when her husband's subjects didn't have that same choice.

But what mattered far more to my family than our political system or what side of politics you came from was what it looked like to live a life of service, and that is exactly how we were told to think about the Queen. I was told that story by my mum so many times, because for her that was exactly what leadership looked like. Sometimes it's easy to be a leader, but it is about how you behave when the chips are down, and what she did was really quite extraordinary.
                                                                    </p>

It's hard to imagine becoming the most powerful woman in the world at the age of 25. It is impossible to imagine doing that in 1952. When the first

That is how irrelevant women were to leadership at that time. Yet the Queen, at the ripe age of 25, became literally the most powerful woman in the world. She carried that off with a level of grace and respect that I think is truly outstanding.
                                                                    </p>

She wasn't full of ego and ambition, and she wasn't that outgoing. But that makes me respect her even more, because everything she did—all the leadership she showed—was done simply for one thing, and that is the duty that she felt towards her subjects. So I say on behalf of my constituents: may she rest in peace.

This coincidence of birth, together with the premature death of the King, thrust Her Majesty, at the age of only 25, into a role for which she was barely prepared. However, in her inimitable, gracious and determined way, Her Majesty rose to her role and reigned for 70 years. Queen Elizabeth served her country and her Commonwealth, including Australia, with kindness and selflessness. In her coronation speech, Her Majesty said:
                                                                     </p>

                                                                     </p>

                                                                     </p>

Queen Elizabeth was a daughter, a sister, a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother. As the head of the most famous family in the world, the Queen had to deal publicly with many of the family traumas that are faced by the rest of us in private. She did this with dignity and grace, although she did admit to her 'annus horribilis' in 1992. Her Majesty was also a wife. We occasionally caught glimpses of the private love and devotion that existed between her and the

The picture of Her Majesty, alone in her grief, farewelling her husband in 2021 is one that many of us will never forget. Indeed, it was Her Majesty who said, when comforting victims' families after the September 11 terrorist attacks, 'Grief is the price we pay for love.'

She made 16 visits here during her reign, and her royal tour in 1954 marked the first time a reigning monarch had travelled to Australia. It was during this tour that she and the duke travelled to the Hughes electorate, in February 1954. Local news reports of the occasion paint a picture of 20,000 people lining the route as the royal motorcade passed under an arch reading, 'We welcome our Queen to Sutherland.' In what would have been a momentous occasion for our local area, men, women and children gathered along the highway to each wave as their sovereign passed by.

Following the news of her death two weeks ago, my electorate office was inundated with calls and visits from constituents seeking a copy of her portrait. It seemed like everyone had a story, a small personal connection to the Queen, a reason why she meant so much to them. Nigel recounted how he had boarded at the Corio campus of

Being of a similar age, Kitty had always felt a kinship with Queen Elizabeth, and this was strengthened during

From the moment she awoke each morning—apparently to bagpipes—to resting her head at night, hers was a daily regimen of duty, of service, of being in the public eye and having every utterance and gesture weighed and measured for its significance. Tabloids and magazines often report on the wealth and privilege that come with being royalty, but it is the duty, the never-ending responsibility that could have crushed lesser people, that is the true story of Elizabeth.

I think it's known that the Queen herself had a wicked sense of humour. Wendy writes, 'You were Queen of hearts, ace at your job, jack-of-all-trades, and you even used a spade.' And Wendy was very insistent that her message finish with a kiss at the end.

May she rest in eternal peace.

My nan polished me up for the occasion, and with my mum's help we picked some fresh lilacs from the tree on the nature strip in the street out in front of our house. Mum wrapped the stems in foil from the kitchen drawer. 'The Queen loves lilacs,' Nan said. Together, we found a place along the route that the Queen would take. Times were different then. There were no metal barricades or heavy security that I can recall. The Queen eventually passed by, but I was too shy and she went on her way. When she paused a little further up the route, Nan gave me a nudge, 'Go, go, go now,' she whispered. So I ducked under the flimsy rail or rope, ran to the Queen and, with an awkward curtsy, handed her the flowers. 'Oh, lilacs. They're my favourite,' she smiled. 'Yeah, my nan told me,' I replied. 'Are they from your garden?' she asked. 'Nah, I picked them off the nature strip.' How she laughed! It was a special moment for a little girl and her nan.

To pay my respect to the Queen doesn't erase the possibility that this moment in history provides for reasoned conversations about our future.

We must ensure that we are not sidetracked in the measured steps we take as a nation towards constitutional recognition of the Voice and that it is not allowed to be compromised by conflation with other constitutional concerns. It is overdue. It's a priority, and it demands a clear run to success. If we're to be truly one and free, this is part of that long and patient journey. Just as the young Queen's coronation was a turning point for hope, this is another.

It was the Queen's wish that Pacific members of the Commonwealth would be able to attend her state funeral along with other Commonwealth nations. The Australian government was pleased to offer our support to fulfil this wish, because although our nations each grieve in our own way, in our own tradition, we share the loss as a family.

We've heard words like 'kind', 'generous', 'personable', a 'humble leader', an 'inspiration', a 'mainstay' of most of our lives. The list of words could go on and on, but it would never be enough to truly encapsulate the incredible woman who we honour in this place today. Who she was, what she did and the way she did those things had a way of transcending the everyday. She led the Commonwealth through the worst of wars. She saw world leaders come and go. She was above politics but far from ignorant of it. She was the prime example of everything a sovereign should be. But, despite her high position, she had a way of touching the lives of so many.

Like many members in this place, I set up a condolence book, in my electorate office, for local residents. The response has been incredible. For the past two weeks, barely five minutes has passed without someone coming in to write a message. It only serves to show what an incredible impact the Queen had on the people of Townsville—even though we are almost 15,000 kilometres away.

This wasn't shared by my dad or his side of the family, who came from a generation which was far more antagonistic to the British occupation of Egypt. But, nonetheless, my maternal grandparents, who migrated to Australia in 1971, had, in their modest housing commission home in Preston in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, a portrait of Her Majesty, which hung in the lounge room and looked over us as little kids running around in the seventies, as teenagers in the eighties and as younger adults visiting—perhaps less so—our grandparents in the 1990s and 2000s.

She's the same age as the Queen, and she shed tears last week at Her Majesty's passing. My nana, just like Her Majesty, has been the constant in our lives—constancy which we've heard a lot about today, in service; holding fast to duty; and constant commitment to faith and family: I'm mindful of these remarkable qualities and the example they present to us. On behalf of the people that I represent in my electorate, the people of Wills, I also pay respects and express condolences at the passing of

All of us here, regardless of what side of politics we're on, are sent here by our constituents to serve, and that duty to serve, I think, is also a great privilege within our democracy. Despite the day-to-day rough and tumble of politics, I know we all come to this place with that firmly in mind because it's not just what our community expects but what they demonstrate themselves in their day-to-day lives.
                                                                          </p>

I'm sure all of my colleagues do the same back in their electorates—spend time with local organisations, sporting clubs, Scout groups, schools, mosques, temples, churches and so many other groups. All of them are bound by that common theme of service, the theme that the Deputy Prime Minister talked about earlier today, that binds us as a democracy and that Her Majesty placed such store in as the critical ingredient to the success of a democratic society, the service to others that she so amazingly embodied for seven decades—service to each other, service to worthy causes and service to the community. To represent my community in this place is to represent that very spirit that drives them, the spirit of service. We might say that this is the Australian spirit, one of looking out for others, a fair go and gratitude, in some ways, for all the great privileges and fortunes we have here in Australia.
                                                                          </p>
                                                                          <p>
                                                                           It has been eloquently said by many speakers that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth dedicated all of her own life to the service of others. 'The little girl who was never meant to rule' we have seen her referred to as in recent weeks. Events, of course, would prove otherwise as she would go on to take the throne at just 25 years of age. Yet even well before all of this, her commitment to the service of others was clear. I think that's probably why the Queen's passing and loss have been so profoundly felt. It's because as Australians I think we can understand and really appreciate the selflessness of service and duty. No matter our background, we can all serve our community in some way.
                                                                          </p>

They were given to people who served their communities, who gave something of themselves for others. That is the very best of our community. I wanted to recognise that here today as well in paying respects to Queen Elizabeth because, with her passing, she would expect everyone to remain focused on that commitment to service. May she rest in peace.

Soon after becoming the sovereign in 1954, a young Queen Elizabeth ventured to our shores and embarked on the most extensive tour of regional Australia of any royal before or since. On 4 March 1954, the Queen departed Melbourne on the royal train, stopping at Seymour before sleeping in the carriage of that train at Goorambat. Goorambat is a small town 60 kilometres to the east of Shepparton, nestled amongst the beautiful cropping country of the Dookie and Devenish plains. In 1954 its population was around 300 people. The Queen and

There is much to reflect on, and I don't propose to go over ground that has been well covered—in particular by the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition this morning. But, across a reign that spanned 70 years, it is important that we look to what has happened to our country and its society in that time—as has been noted, the symmetry of 16 prime ministers and 16 visits. Our society has changed almost immeasurably, but Queen

                                                                            </p>

She, of course, did not. It was chosen for her. At a young age, she had extraordinary responsibilities thrust upon her—responsibilities that she could not at any time step away from. The scale of this seems almost unimaginable. What is to me equally unimaginable is that she was such an exemplar of a life in the service of others, and that is the reflection that I want to share with this House as a person who has chosen public service for the moment—to reflect on the manner in which she discharged her obligation to others and always put the community that she served first.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                             I rise here to speak on behalf of the people of the Scullin electorate, many of whom have been deeply affected by Her Majesty's passing. Unlike others, I have no personal story worthy of the telling. I never met Her Majesty, although as a primary school student I sought to wave to her. I'm not sure whether she saw my hand or my flag either. But I've been struck in the past fortnight by how much her passing has affected so many people, again in ways that I think many had not foreseen. I've seen the messages in the condolence book in my electorate office, and it's really touching to read those messages. The requests for Her Majesty's portraits have, I think, caused us all some logistical challenges in our electorate offices, so, if anyone could assist me, that would be much appreciated! Again, her passing has affected so many in so many ways. In recognising this, I'm mindful of those most affected: the royal family. In wishing that she rest in peace, my thoughts are with all of them. Vale.

As has been rightly reflected on, including most recently by the member for Scullin, our nation has changed enormously over that period. Therefore we are reflecting, as we think about her life of service, on the special relationship between Her Majesty and Australia and the way that our own nation has evolved and grown over that extraordinary period of 70 years.

Over the time of Her Majesty's reign, Australia's sense of self and sense of identity has grown and developed. She had a significant part in many steps along the way, including, of course, the opening of this building in which we are all privileged to work, Parliament House, in 1988.

That does not distinguish my electorate from every electorate around the country, as many members have reported to the House. It's interesting to look back at some of the historical evidence of that affection for Her Majesty. There was spirited debate in the Sydney newspapers in advance of Her Majesty's first visit as to the itinerary of the royal tour, and there were complaints that Her Majesty would not be visiting what was described as 'the most attractive part of Sydney', that being the area from Chatswood north. Of course, I agree that that is the most attractive part of Sydney! The depth of feeling on this issue was so great that two members of the

But I think what we can also see is a longstanding interest in Australia, evidenced, among other things, by the fact that she sent her young son to high school in Australia for a period of time.

It's significant, I think, that her last official act as sovereign was to appoint a new prime minister in the United Kingdom. It was a life of service, a life committed to timeless values and a life aligned with the growth in Australia's own sense of self and confidence.

Many of us, including me, grew up singing 'God Save the Queen' at school assembly and seeing her image on our coins, notes and stamps. The Queen's historic reign and lifelong devotion to duty, family and service is unlikely ever to be equalled. On behalf of the people of my electorate of Corangamite, I offer our deep condolences to the royal family, who are grieving for a beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother—yet this grief must be so publicly played out, with the world watching on.
                                                                              </p>

Many are expressing their feelings of grief in condolence books like the one in my electorate office in Corangamite. Their grief and sadness are real and heartfelt. They are remembering how the Queen celebrated with us in good times and stood by us in times of challenge. They are recounting the sympathy and personal kindness Her Majesty extended to Australians during times of tragedy and disaster. She was a monarch who displayed humanity and performed her duty with integrity and humour. While memories will endure, adjusting to a new reality without the Queen will be difficult for many.

The Queen's famous sense of humour was on show. Crowds cheered as the Queen beamed in all directions when Spud the sheepdog temporarily lost his way in the crowd while displaying his sheep-herding talents for the royal couple. A resulting photo of the Queen, head back in laughter, was published in news reports around the world. The natural, good-natured spontaneity and humour that endeared the Queen to Australians was apparent. It was clear why Her Majesty held a special place in her heart for Australia, just as Australians continue to hold a special place in their hearts for her.

It's testament to the Queen's integrity that people from across the political spectrum, regardless of their views on the monarchy, are recognising her selflessness, calm and stoicism. While the passing of the Queen has prompted many to consider our nation's future, there will be time to do so. But today we honour an extraordinary life, a life well lived, a life of service and public duty, and one that transcended politics.

Her diplomacy and embracing of diversity are significant reasons why people in Australia and around the world are mourning her passing. It's appropriate that we as Australians take time to reflect on the profound loss of this great woman and Queen. This time of mourning will pass.

That was back in the 1960s. I reflect on the stability that the Queen has provided to Australia and, indeed, the world over seven decades. As the Leader of the Opposition stated yesterday, if 'grief is the price we pay for love'—quoting the Queen—then the outpouring of global grief in these past two weeks speaks to just how much she was loved.

And she kept her word for 70 years. Queen Elizabeth came to timelessly represent the virtues of service, sacrifice, duty, humility and hard work. She walked the talk. To my way of thinking, there has been no greater role model to women in leadership than Queen Elizabeth II. Following her coronation in 1953, the Queen said:

Queen Elizabeth II was, and will continue to be, held in respect and deep affection by our nation, the people of the Commonwealth and around the world. She leaves a legacy of service, faith, stability, sacrifice and strength, through dark days and times of triumph. Though the world changed constantly, she remained steadfast in her devotion to God, her family, her country and the Commonwealth of Nations.

I know, because one of my grandchildren is named after me. Indeed, royal names have been popular choices for many newborns. When Princess Elizabeth became Queen, baby girls across the world were named Elizabeth for years, and I am one. My husband was named Philip, after her husband,

In preparing to speak today, I was struck, like many in the chamber—many of whom have expressed it—by the longevity of the 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth. In doing so, and in doing the research around the questions we've all been asking in preparation for today, I wondered: did the Queen visit my electorate? And the answer for me was proudly yes. She did in 1954. Young Queen Elizabeth visited just the outskirts of the electorate.

What was important that day was that she was visiting the first RAAF base in Australia—the oldest RAAF base in Australia—but, more importantly, that the women's units from across Melbourne were there. It was noted in the

The best way that I can explain that to my community is the fact that, on her first visit, in 1954, Her Majesty was welcomed by Sir William Slim as Governor-General and

I want to focus on how much the world had changed for women. This whole thing has got me thinking about my mum—who I obviously lost quite recently, and most people know that—who was a great fan of Queen Elizabeth and a contemporary of Queen Elizabeth. It got me thinking about what it would have meant to my 23-year-old mother when Elizabeth ascended to the throne and became Queen, and what it meant to all the women of her generation. We often say of that generation that they're known for their stoicism, for their practicality and for the way they dealt with life. I think Queen Elizabeth led them in the development of those things that we say about that generation of people.
                                                                                </p>

Let's be blunt—other than
                                                                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                 </a>

They became aware, and they asked questions, I assume, that wouldn't have been asked had Elizabeth not been Queen. Queen Elizabeth being Queen caused them to observe and to ask questions of themselves and of their lifestyle. In doing so, she changed not just the way the women in Australia and across the Commonwealth saw their roles but possibly the way their husbands and partners saw women as well. That played a major part in the reason I'm sitting here in the House of Representatives today surrounded by my female colleagues.
                                                                                </p>

Questions would have been asked: 'Could I be the Queen? Could I leave my children for the eight or 10 weeks that this was going to take?' They asked questions and then answered those questions in their own daughters' and sons' lives by changing expectations about their roles and seeing that the Queen was able to be an international leader and be a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother. Rest in peace, Queen Elizabeth—and I hope my mum and you are sharing a cup of tea right now.

In those endless public events, she never flagged. I saw a report that said she'd personally met around three million people in her life. She was constantly on duty but was a devoted wife and mother, with an extreme love for her family.

She was steadfast and uplifting in times of national tragedy or trial, like COVID, and always positive in a message of hope: we're in this together, it will be okay, and we will overcome. With that wonderful sense of duty of her generation, she was a key part of the courage and dedication of the royal family during the German Blitz on London in 1940 and 1941. I think, from memory, she is the last head of state who lived through World War II. She had a very profound effect in her visit to

For those of us who lost our mothers, in a sense it was like losing our own mothers again—that wise, strong, reliable and loving presence in our lives. That enormous sense of sadness and loss was shared by men and women. But what a wonderful example she was of how to come to the end of your life genuinely respected. The outpouring of grief and some of the messages in the floral tributes told her story. One said:

But I really hope that she knew how much she was loved. I hope she knew how much she was respected, and I hope she knew what an inspiration she's been and will be for generations to come. It has been said that all she could do she has now done. And, as has been said: ma'am, your duty is done. May she rest in eternal peace.

There were memories of older Australians who could recall the death of her father and how they felt when they heard that a young woman would be the Queen.

So many days over the last fortnight have been days of reflection and remembrance, and today is one of those days for our parliament. Whilst we've always known about the inevitability of the passing of the Queen—inevitable for all of us, ultimately—this has nevertheless impacted so many Australians and indeed so many people around the world.
                                                                                   </p>

In a rapidly changing world, this has been a reassuring and immovable touchstone, particularly with change seemingly getting more rapid by the year. Her Majesty has also been a thread that has woven generations of Australian families together, including mine. I've got no doubt that her steady presence has not just supported so many Australians as individuals but also supported our confident national psyche. Most importantly for me, Her Majesty embodied servant leadership, something that's been mentioned a lot today. When she said in her speech on her 21st birthday in 1947:
                                                                                   </p>

At that time unmarried women under 30 had to join the armed forces or work on the land or in industry. Princess Elizabeth enthusiastically enlisted and was later promoted to junior commander, which is the equivalent of a captain. And who, of course, could ever forget the sight of Her Majesty sitting silently, alone in her grief, at the funeral of her late husband,
                                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip" rel="nofollow">

This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, whatever one's views of the rules that were imposed at that time, seeing the Queen following the same rules as all others and not seeking any form of preferential treatment was a testament to her leadership by example.
                                                                                   </p>

She seemed unaffected by the fads or trends of the day, and, whilst she always reflected the inevitable evolution of the modern world and the Commonwealth, she never succumbed to the all-too-modern pressure of ditching those values which have stood the test of time. Indeed, her faith, which she famously described as one of the three pillars of her life, along with family and friends, remained strong throughout her life. Her words in the 2014 Queen's Christmas message said it best in my view:
                                                                                   </p>

A role-model of reconciliation and forgiveness, he stretched out his hands in love, acceptance and healing.

It would be another 30 years after that before the High Court overturned the legal fiction of terra nullius and recognised the precolonial land interests of First Nations Australians in the 1992 Mabo decision. We will soon sow further change as our nation pursues the implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, voice, treaty and truth.

We have changed so much for the better. But, while so much changed, Her Majesty remained. As Prime Minister Albanese said, 'Her Majesty was a rare and reassuring constant amidst rapid change.' We've seen, this week, the way that national symbols matter, how powerful they can be. We've seen it in the way so many people in the United Kingdom flocked to pay tribute to the passing of their monarch and the way their country has united in this moment. In Australia, Her Majesty was held in high personal regard by many Australians. She took on the throne at just 25 years of age, thrust into the unenviable role as a constitutional monarch. She was dedicated to duty as she conceived it. She sought to leave the institutions she worked within in better shape than when she'd inherited them. This is an example that all of us in this place can learn from.

It is also a source of wry frustration for republicans like myself. Republicans can only express our opposition to the continuance of the institution of hereditary monarchy in Australia, not to Her Majesty's extraordinary life of service. She was one of a kind, and her passing marks the end of an era. May she rest in peace.

She was not just a beacon of stability for the United Kingdom but an exemplary international leader and a source of unity for the whole Commonwealth and for our nation during her 70 years of faithful service to us. She was wise counsel to many Australian prime ministers—in fact, 16 of them—and 179 prime ministers around the Commonwealth. She went through wars, other conflicts, natural disasters, periods of rapid social change, political upheavals, boom and bust and depression, and she was a source of reassurance to people around the world, but particularly in Australia, during that time. Whether it was floods, droughts, bushfires or other natural disasters, she always kept a kindly and genuine interest in all of us.

Seeing all the other systems of government around the world—the troubles with republics and various other forms of government, with ultimate and supreme power vested in one elected official who has essentially a political role—you can see the benefits of having a constitutional monarchy. Many in this chamber and around the world have a problem with a monarch being a hereditary position, but the fact that it's not political—it's above the fray and the monarch is generally well educated these days—is the essentially good thing about a constitutional monarchy.

We have the benefit of things that the United Kingdom went through in the 1600s. We're the beneficiary of all the turmoil that they went through, and many countries in the Commonwealth are similar beneficiaries.

When you see her personal musings and her published words of condolence, advice, encouragement and analysis on the big things in life in her public speeches, she really was a philosopher queen. It's only when you don't have something that you really notice its loss. So we all mourn her passing and thank her for her service. God save the King.

She had lived a good life—a good innings, as they say: just short of a ton—but it still is a sad time for many, particularly her family. The Queen was a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother. She will be remembered for being a monarch who witnessed and influenced the trajectory of modern history.

The messages will also be archived by the Commonwealth and may be displayed in national institutions to form a lasting record of this moment in our history. In the past fortnight, there have been many who have also shared their reflections of Her Majesty on social media, local media and social gatherings. Many have said things such as, 'She's the only queen I've ever known,' 'It is the end of an era,' 'A life of service and duty,' 'A kind lady with a generous smile,' 'She was like my grandmother,'—and that's a comment that we've heard quite a few times today—'and her passing just reminded me of my own personal loss.'
                                                                                      </p>

At the young age of 25, she became the head of our Commonwealth and many times was the only woman in those early days to stand in a room of leaders. Today, if she stood in that same room, some things will have changed, but there are still lots of men standing. We are still short of that goal of fifty-fifty. The scrutiny that she lived through—there aren't many that would be on the same level of scrutiny that she experienced: every word, every tour, every speech scrutinised. Every time a family member said something or did something wrong, it was quite often reflected on the Queen. Yes, in public life we expect scrutiny, but the scrutiny that the Queen went through was unprecedented.

And I think that's okay. Australia today is a very different country to when the Queen was first crowned our sovereign. Today we are many cultures and histories woven together to make the modern Australian story. At yesterday's national memorial service in the

Many Dawson residents have told their stories of the time they got to meet our Queen. She famously said, following her visit to Mackay, that she left with a deeper understanding of

If Australia is a house, then Queen Elizabeth was the concrete slab that was our foundation. It was not going anywhere. It didn't matter what was thrown at the house, because, no matter what, it was locked into that slab, and there was no way that slab was moving. The slab never cracks, and it never breaks. It does not matter what happens to the house—pieces can fall off and it can sway in the breeze, but that concrete slab holds it together. Whenever the house felt like it was going to fall down or wasn't going to be as strong as it could be, it could always rely on that slab to be just as stable as when it was first poured. Queen Elizabeth was that concrete slab. She was that stable rock that kept us strong through thick and thin. We could always rely on her. She was a kind, caring and compassionate leader, and a daughter, sister, aunty, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother whom everyone respected.

I would also like to thank the many who have come into my office to leave a message of condolence. I will make sure that these messages are passed on. This outpouring of both grief and support demonstrates how highly regarded the late Queen was and how her legacy will stay with us. I'd like to pass on just one of those messages from Dawson.

May her inspirational life of service and sacrifice, fortitude and humility, grace and generosity, and forgiveness and empathy be remembered throughout the history of our nation. Rest in peace, o gracious lady. Long live the King.

Many Australians from my generation had a fondness for Her Majesty like that of a grandmother figure. We heard her voice through the radio, saw her face on coins, stamps and currency, and watched her deliver her Christmas message every year. She was the Queen who was never meant to be but through her circumstance stepped up to lead and to unite. For seven decades her graciousness ruled, modernising monarchy with a steady hand and heart.

Her big sister, June, received a coronation book when she was selected by her school to wave a flag and in turn receive a royal wave, as I did 28 years later. Generations of Australians have cherished memories of Her Majesty, including those who immigrated here, including my mother's family, the Aldersons.

His answer was swift and simple. He turned his full attention to me and without hesitation said, 'To serve and protect the Queen.' I remember the emotion in his eyes. I remember every fibre of my being reacting to the deep-seated, genuine reaction that I had just witnessed. It was spontaneous and it was genuine. It was a reaction that I vividly recalled just a few days ago whilst watching, like many others in this place and around the world, the Queen's state funeral. Her Majesty's royal military procession did her proud. It was a true reflection of the respect, love and loyalty each individual serviceman and servicewoman had for their Queen, and this resonated right around the world.

Her Majesty would not be rushed by officials and often had those to whom she was talking spontaneously burst out laughing at a comment she had made. Without doubt, the Queen most certainly did have a good sense of humour.

Our Queen was a loving wife, mother, aunty, granny, great-granny, great-aunty, friend and ruler and did her country proud. Leaders from all corners of the world attended the state funeral to pay respects. It was respect well and truly earnt and deserved.

The Queen had a deep understanding of and commitment to her responsibilities and duty for her country, her Commonwealth but, most of all, her people. We will miss her steadfast leadership, her gentle guiding hand and her love, because she led not just through words but with her actions.

Like many here, I represent an electorate that she visited. She visited Casey in 1954, during her first royal tour. She was greeted by 20,000 locals in Lilydale who climbed trees and fences just to catch a glimpse of their young Queen. The crowd sang 'God Save the Queen' and waved 5,000 souvenir flags. Even though the Queen only stayed for 15 minutes, the local paper termed the visit 'a truly momentous occasion for Lilydale—one that the thousands of old and young will never forget'.

One of the speakers was Noel, who saw the Queen in 1954, and he'd brought with him the two flags that he waved on the day. It was touching to see and hear the emotion in Noel's voice and face as he described the visit and how much seeing the Queen, even fleetingly, meant to him. It was a poignant reminder of the place the Queen held in so many hearts. Neil Stony from

As he rode, he waved to the Queen, and, to his delight, she came out onto the carriage observation deck and waved back. He often reflects on this experience and hopes she enjoyed his jubilation and horsemanship that day. Betty McGeorge, a Casey local celebrating her 90th birthday this week, saw the coronation of the Queen 70 years ago as the dawn of a new era.

After three months of regular updates to the palace, the Premier decided to cease sending them, as they were entering the recovery phase, and he assumed the Queen would not wish to continue receiving them so frequently. The Queen quickly sent a message: 'Her Majesty would be keen to continue with the daily briefings.' Her interest and empathy meant a lot to our community. Her care and love helped our community to grieve, recover and rebuild.

She put the duty to her people above her own personal needs. She epitomised servant leadership. She truly was worthy of our trust. She gave us her heart and her devotion for her entire life, and we are thankful. Vale Queen Elizabeth II. God save the King.

I shared my primary school memories with the students so that they could understand the significance of Queen Elizabeth to my generation almost six decades ago, because they too, being children of migrants and refugees, are developing a sense of being Australian and developing their own Australian identity but in a different era, one in which as Australians we have grown and matured, understanding ourselves as being a nation of early settlers, migrants and refugees with an Indigenous inheritance of our First People, who we continue to strive to appropriately recognise and reconcile with.

Mary Elizabeth recalls that the Queen had to initiate all conversation and that she was, 'highly intelligent, knowledgeable and friendly, and throughout her reign the Queen adjusted to the changing mores of society that enabled the monarchy to become more identified with the wider community'.

Many Flynn residents have contacted both my Gladstone and Emerald offices with requests for a portrait of the late Queen and have signed the condolence books to pay their respects. In conclusion, Queen Elizabeth lived a life of service to her country and the Commonwealth. Above all, she was a beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.

With absolute perfection and precision at each step of the way, the endless formalities and ceremonies, which included the participation of a wide cross-section of British society, including the royal family, military and police sectors, Scottish bagpipes, religious ceremonies, angelic choirs and everyday British people, were all meticulously planned and superbly executed.

                                                                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                               </a>

The public fascination with protocol and regalia suggests to me that these practices still serve an important function in society and that there is a silent public craving for ceremonial conventions. In a world where there is growing indifference to civic standards of behaviour, protocols do not merely reflect heritage and historical traditions; they express public standards, pride, tradition and appreciation—protocols observed so well by Queen Elizabeth II. Protocols also reflect an orderly society and the values which guide that order. Importantly, protocol brings dignity to the person or the occasion. The protocols and ceremonies in response to the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, including here in Australia and in this parliament, speak so clearly to how highly she was regarded, and how widely.
                                                                                              </p>

Watching Queen Elizabeth's family members on ceremonial parade on the day of her funeral and on the days leading up to it, with media and public eyes scrutinising their every move, brought home the reality that these were real people grieving the loss of a person very dear to their hearts. To all of them, I—and on behalf of the people of Makin—offer my sincere condolences. More than anyone else I know of, Queen Elizabeth II lived under that intense spotlight for 70 years, never able to let her guard down whilst in public. Yet, to my knowledge, not once did she falter. It was her persona and her decency, which others have spoken so extensively about, that brought dignity and honour not just to herself but to the entire British monarchy.

When the Queen travelled to Australia in 1954, it was the first time a reigning monarch had ever visited Australia. However, her association with Australia preceded that with almost 30 kilograms of dried fruit having been provided for her wedding cake in 1947, the '10,000 mile cake,' by

When the Queen first toured Australia in 1954, Australia was still experiencing the burden of the white Australia policy. It was a very different nation from the Australia of 2022. Almost seven decades on from that first visit, we are now one of the world's great multicultural communities. We are simultaneously home to the world's oldest continuous culture and to people who identify from over 270 different ancestries. I represent one of the country's most diverse electorates, nearly half of its over 170,000 citizens were born overseas or have parents born overseas. They come from over 170 countries, with the largest community having its origins in Vietnam. The residents of Fraser speak over 111 languages and practice over 30 religions.
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                 In reflecting on the Queen's life, I also reflected on why and how she mattered for a highly diverse modern community such as my own, many of whose members arrived in Australia only recently. What is the role the Queen played in modern Australia, and how had this evolved as Australia had? In a recent essay about the monarch's nuanced relationship with modern Australia's multiculturalism, a young person from Australia's Vietnamese community noted that the involvement of the Queen in community service over an extended period of time had resonated with her and many in her community. She said:
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p class="italic">
                                                                                                 Look at my family, they're very big on the good works and good deeds … I think that could be a reflection of the wider community. Actions speak louder than words.
                                                                                                </p>

                                                                                                </p>

She lived through an era when Australia and many other nations experienced a range of challenges that created many social tensions and were misused by many to sow division. A good example of her response to this was her 2004 annual Christmas message. When many countries in the world were responding to the threat of terrorism, she highlighted the parable of the good Samaritan, who helped a despised foreigner. She said:
                                                                                                </p>

The Queen and Prince Philip may have been on the ground for just on an hour and a half that day, but both my great-grandmother's dress and the official invitation are still with my mum in Coonabarabran, who fondly recalls her grandparents regaling her with the experience. It seems that it really didn't matter how long you had in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II; somehow, she had a way of making every person she met feel like they were the only one that mattered in that moment and that she, like they, would remember the exchange for a lifetime.

I do believe, in the complex nature of this nation, there is room to both acknowledge and respect the role Her Majesty has played throughout her life and, at the same time, understand its place in our history. That is, after all, how we change: by recognising who we are as a nation—all of our history in its complexity and how it has been experienced differently by different peoples and by respecting those experiences and working together to shape what comes next. It's in that spirit that I wish to acknowledge the rich contribution of Queen

The story of the past 70 years tells an extraordinary story of our nation's progress. From 1954, with the Queen's first visit to our shores, the nation was a very different place, and my home town of Ballarat was very different, too.

If you look at the photos from 1954, it looks like the entire town of Ballarat was there, decked out in their best and crowding the streets for the very best view. The photos of the Queen in the Botanic Gardens at the—then only second—Ballarat Begonia Festival are very much part of our local history. It was reported that she said: 'We grow begonias as big as saucers, but you as big as dinner plates.' By the year 2000, the crowds along Sturt Street hadn't thinned. I was elected the year after her visit. If you talk to anyone who lived in Ballarat at the time, we have very clear memories of the day, whether it be of gathering with family, friends or school groups, or of some of the gorgeous women in our community dressed up in tiaras and pearls as they greeted her. I've never actually been able to confirm this story, but local legend tells us that there was some controversy that helicopters were hired to be flown down the main street the day before her visit to ensure that any lose acorns were blown from the trees, as there was great concern that Her Majesty would slip on one or roll her ankle on her walk down Sturt Street. We showed her our best on those occasions, whether it was through the beautiful Begonia Festival in 1954 or at our famous

In 1954, we were still a small town in a distant corner of the world. By 2000, Ballarat and the world had changed, and we've been changing ever since. Through all of that change, there has been a constant: a woman of extraordinary dedication to service, to duty, to family and to people. The people of Ballarat send our condolences to King

She was part of the 70 per cent of Australians who turned out to see the Queen while she was visiting Australia. She had a fleeting interaction with the Queen, and it became an anecdote to be passed down the generations. I find it hard to imagine the pressure of every moment of small talk turning into a treasured anecdote for someone, let alone for 70 years.

She was part of the generation who grew up in the Depression and spent their formative years in a world war. They were shaped by service to community and country and making the best of it. There was to be no complaining. People had manners, treated each other with compassion and focused more on their own obligations than on their rights. Life was about community, and she spent much of her energy recognising people's contributions to community. These are core virtues that have not been tested in a generation like mine in Australia. Living through relative peace and economic prosperity has shifted our focus inwards. In many ways, we are the poorer for it.

The role of the Crown has shifted and will continue to shift. There must have been times when she didn't know how to fulfil her duty, when the modern world and the millennium-old institution she was upholding came into conflict. She must have felt frustrated by decisions of the leaders who served alongside her, unsure about how to respond to the long-term impacts of colonisation and bemused by the shifting values of those around her. But she never showed it. She knew that her role was to provide stability and dignity, and she delivered that to the end, through 16 Australian prime ministers and 40 corgis. She was the custodian of the British culture of self-restraint.

I learnt yesterday of the passing of another cultural leader, Mr Woolagoodja, a respected Worrorra man and artist from the Mowanjum community in the Kimberley region, whose art of the wandjina, a sacred creation spirit, was the centrepiece at the opening of the

He too, like the Queen, worked hard to preserve his culture following his people's removal off their country to Mowanjum community near Derby, leaving a legacy for emerging community leaders. I pay my respects for his passing too. Mowanjum is a long way from London, but, at this time of mourning across the world, we can learn from

In the course of 70 years of service and duty, we came to learn a lot about her sense of humour and her unwavering grace and commitment to service, including to the Australian people. Her Majesty demonstrated a great interest in the vitality and prosperity of regional Australia, and she spent time in many regional centres and small towns, many of which are in the electorate of Eden-Monaro.

Her presence was felt across the region, visiting Cooma, Jindabyne, Eucumbene, Kiandra, Guthega and Cabramurra, from Talbingo to Khancoban and Adaminaby to Berridale, through to Queanbeyan, where Her Majesty unveiled a plaque to commemorate her visit in 1977 which still stands today in the bicentennial hall. The Queen made visiting our regions a priority, and these townships and their communities are forever etched into royal history.

It is not lost on me, when reflecting on Queen Elizabeth II's journey across Eden-Monaro, across Australia and the entire Commonwealth, that her journeys would have taken in probably millions of kilometres, travelling the realm, visiting communities big and small, to express her service to our communities. I want to express my deep respect and admiration to Her Majesty for that feat alone.

In her leadership and service, she has inspired countless people to advocate for and represent their own communities.

Her commitment to Canberra, visiting the national capital on 14 separate occasions—more than any other Australian city—showed that the most.

She was born in 1926 and, as a young girl, lived in London during the Blitz.

Apart from opening the parliament and signing various instruments et cetera, which she did with great aplomb and consistency, she was an unbelievable leader, patron and contributor to communities throughout the Commonwealth, both before and during her 70-year reign. In this country, of course, we were particularly lucky to have her visit us on 16 separate occasions, and every time she had such a spectacular impact on so many communities throughout the nation.

We are one of the greatest, proudest and oldest continuing democracies, and it is because we have a constitutional monarchy. Her custodianship of the role of sovereign of the Crown and that institution for 70 years is why we continue to be such a vibrant democracy. The monarchy is at the head of so many elements of our society, government and economy—this parliament of course, the executive, the judiciary, the armed forces and many community organisations, from the Scouts and

As so many members have reflected, at all of the offices where we've had condolence books we've had people coming in a steady stream not only to leave a message but often to have conversations with members and staff. Sometimes they've spoken about personal experiences they had with the sovereign, but also they've spoken of their love and admiration for Queen Elizabeth II and what she did in that role for so very, very long.
                                                                                                     </p>

It reminds us of what an exceptionally hardworking lady she was into her 96th year. More than 30 years after the retirement age in the United Kingdom, she was still working harder than any of us—because, of course, she took so seriously that vow of serving the Commonwealth for the entirety of her life. She absolutely kept that vow.

Her Majesty's dedicated service to the people of the United Kingdom and, indeed, all of her subjects within the Commonwealth since 1952 was without equal. For the vast majority of Australians, she was the only monarch we ever knew. Her warmth, presence and voice were a steady source of comfort and reassurance, and their absence will be sorely felt by many.

Our easygoing attitude and our beautiful land leave an impression on most, and this was certainly reflected by our Queen. Her admiration was shown on many occasions. Indeed, on her last visit to Australia, in 2011, she remarked:
                                                                                                      </p>

This country has made dramatic progress economically, in social, scientific and industrial endeavours and, above all, in self-confidence.

No matter the issue or event, Her Majesty approached all matters with the grace and diligence she was well known for. She placed her faith in the people of Australia and in our institutions to solve the challenges facing our nation.

The Queen was truly dedicated to each Commonwealth nation and showed admiration for all cultures and religions.

What unites their views is the feeling that Queen Elizabeth was, to them, both a phenomenon, a symbol of modern history; and a person, a woman who assumed a role of great responsibility at an early age, who carried that responsibility throughout her adult life—a woman for whom most felt great respect and admiration.

The circumstances of her birth were such that that could never be her future, but her love of the countryside remained and was transmitted into decades of advocacy for wildlife and the environment.

Those older Australians grew up with Her Majesty. As they married and had children, so too did their Queen. As they moved through each stage of life experiencing love and loss, so too did their Queen. As they raised their children and their grandchildren, we learnt from them of a Queen that they felt connected to, a constant in their lives and then in our lives, whose steadfast stoicism was always there providing familiar comfort and calm.

The Queen represents a generation that we may never see again, one of unwavering commitment to duty and a lifetime of public service in the greatest of limelight. She embodied grace, care, comfort and kindness. She was a source of strength and stability in an ever-changing world.

She began her training as a mechanic in March 1945 and undertook a driving and vehicle maintenance course. She carried what she learned as a mechanic throughout the whole of her life, often being seen behind the wheel. She was even known to diagnose and repair a faulty engine, just as she had been taught to do during her wartime service. Even as a Queen of 70 years she still had more experience in a trade than many in this place. This just goes to show you that, regardless of your status or position in the world, good life experience and hands-on training in a trade will never go to waste.

After visiting these myself, it was easy to see why she loved these amazing animals so much. Her love of cars and horses, plus her good sense of humour, made her well placed to fit in with many everyday Australians. I reckon she and I would have got along pretty well, too.

As someone who participated in the Commonwealth Games, I would thank Her Majesty for her support of the games and the athletes around the world. Some of my best memories are from representing Australia on the Commonwealth stage. This could not have been made possible without the support of the Queen. For this, I am extremely grateful.

However, I'm sure that many in the Hunter have memories of heading to Newcastle or Maitland to join the thousands who lined the streets just to get a glimpse of the monarch.

We have heard many condolences from members in the House today paying tribute to and farewelling one of the longest-reigning monarchs, who served her people with grace, humility and empathy. Queen Elizabeth's reign was unique and it was selfless. A woman ahead of her time, she reigned with compassion and led by example in acts of service instead of ruling with an iron fist as those before her did. She knew the Crown and the monarchy could exist not by demanding service from its people but, rather, by serving them.

Many are migrants and refugees and got to know the monarchy and its great democratic institutions following their resettlement here in Australia. Many of our culturally diverse groups have held memorial services to mark her passing, holding their own unique interpretations of a memorial service. Our Fowler electorate office has also been inundated with requests for her portrait, and we have a waiting list as we put in more orders.

Twenty-five years old—what a young age to step into public life, and Her Majesty did this day after day for 70 years. We live in a time when people typically change their career three times in their lifetime and retire in their 60s as opposed to their 90s. Queen Elizabeth's commitment to community service was clear.

When she was 19 years old, she trained as a mechanic. I imagine she was part of a small but growing number of women who picked up a trade during wartime efforts. I hope that this little-known fact encourages girls to understand that you can both get on the tools and put on a dress and frock up—but perhaps not at the same time!

Lady Gowrie—another woman ahead of her time—was passionate about the wellbeing of children and early childhood education, particularly for disadvantaged children. She achieved the extraordinary, which was that the Commonwealth government established Lady Gowrie childcare centres in 1939. Child care was critical due to skills shortages from the wartime effort, and, of course, child care allowed women to step up and participate in the paid workforce. Better access to child care was needed in the 1930s, and we still need it in the 2020s.

                                                                                                           In my humble opinion, our Queen had the most genuine smiles and the twinkliest eyes when she interacted with children. Perhaps this was because of children's infectious joy and unfiltered enthusiasm. I love this story from her visit to Geraldton in 1988. Two sisters, Belinda de Corti and Jo Hawkins, had travelled with their parents from Mullewa. As free-spirited country girls do, they ran into the crowd, past the barricades, to present the Queen with some flowers. Quickly, security nabbed Belinda, and she immediately burst into tears.

The girls remember a gentle and kind lady. The Queen was in disbelief when the girls explained that they had a pet kangaroo and an emu back on the farm.

In the Goldfields, a young 26-year-old woman, Kerry Pettit, got the gig of teaching 1,200 students from multiple schools to perform a dance for the Queen. She only had three months to prepare. She had to somehow take a gaggle of students from multiple schools in multiple towns and transform them into a unified dance troupe literally fit for a Queen. Students from Kambalda, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie piled onto the oval draped in green and gold. I was lucky enough to be one of those students, so I got to rock out to Johnny Farnham's 'You're the Voice' and 'Celebration' for the Queen.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           I would not have imagined that a little girl who danced for the Queen on the grass at the Kalgoorlie oval would, 36 years later, swear allegiance to the Queen as our head of state in this very place. Of course, Her Majesty opened this building, which she explained is the embodiment of the democratic principles of freedom, equality and justice, which I feel is the reason why I'm here. Following on from what our Prime Minister said yesterday, I agree that the biggest tribute that we can pay to the Queen is to have a sense of duty to each other and a renewed sense of service to our community.

Many of my colleagues have spoken about the great affection in which the Queen was held, and they're right. No person was more respected across Australian society. That respect was held not simply because of her office but because of how she conducted herself in that office. We saw something in her that we would like to see in ourselves.
                                                                                                           </p>

The Queen was the living embodiment of the power of perseverance. Stoic, steadfast, resolute. Through the trials faced by her nation, her family and the world, she kept going. I think that quiet perseverance is at the heart of why we so admired the Queen. In every life, challenges arise, and it can be hard to stay the course. The Queen never wavered. On some deep level, as human beings, we know that perseverance is everything. The Queen persevered.
                                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                                            Those who have great privilege and responsibility given to them can respond in extremely different ways. There are countless examples in history of people who inherited great power behaving shamefully. Sometimes they were indifferent to the people they were meant to serve. Sometimes their self-absorption consumed them. Sometimes they were deliberately destructive. Their power allowed them to indulge themselves. The Queen took the exact opposite course.
                                                                                                           </p>

Where some would give lip service to the idea of duty, she lived it. She didn't flinch. She didn't falter. She never gave up. Her guiding light was not her ego, but her country. The values of duty, honour and country can seem passe in the modern world, but in the 20th century those values saved the world. They may be called upon again.
                                                                                                           </p>

In our own ways, large and small, we should define our duty and then live it. Like her, we should persevere.

The queen demonstrated an unstinting passion for charities, donating far and wide across multiple countries and communities. Ryde-Eastwood Leagues, in its own right, donates and prides itself in passionately supporting its own community.

She became a symbol of inspiration for many, both within the United Kingdom and here in Australia, as our head of state. In much the same vein, we always look to lead in the same way by example to our communities.

We along with the wider area of Bennelong reflect on the great contribution and dedication the Queen gave in her time and use this as inspiration for who we are and want to be.

I want to associate myself with the comments made today by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and with the reverent contributions that they made. In those contributions, it was said that grief is the price we pay for love. It was a great love we had for our Queen; thus, a great grief.

As a new member, having been sworn in at the dispatch box in this chamber only 12 months beforehand and having given a service of allegiance to Queen and country, to then be in her presence was overwhelming. She was 85, and her husband, Philip, was then 90. She visited Canberra, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, and the year following that she celebrated her 60th year on the throne.

They must have picked up a bit about the making of steel and the importance of steel to the Illawarra economy of the time, because on her 16th and final visit, when the Queen and the Duke were here in attendance at Parliament House, I had a conversation with the Duke, and I was surprised with his forensic knowledge of steelmaking, particularly the blast furnace method of steelmaking, and its contribution to the Illawarra and, indeed, to the country.

This was forced upon it by social change that surrounded it. It's also a mark of the Queen's abilities that this change was accomplished within the monarchy and with her role in British life intact. It has been remarked upon many times in contributions by members before me today that it is unlikely that we'll see the likes of her again—her commitment to service, her commitment to the institution of the monarchy, her commitment to public service—and for that we pay her credit. We thank her for her service. She will, as has been said many times, be remembered fondly for many generations to come.

Nearly the entire population of the town, 8,000 at that time, came out to pledge their loyalty to the Queen en masse.

Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch that I have ever known in my lifetime, and I will always admire her stoic dedication to service as leader of the Commonwealth, of which Australia is a proud member.

After she became Queen, her reign included numerous visits to Australia, and it is clear through these many visits that she had a fond appreciation of Australia—of the land and of its people. Queen Elizabeth II's first visit to Australia as Queen, and as the only reigning monarch to have ever done so, was following her coronation in 1954. The official royal tour covered large swathes of the nation, and it is said that three-quarters of the Australian population came out to witness and meet with

During the journey from Sydney to Newcastle, the royal train would slow down at Gosford station and at Wyong station so that Her Majesty could greet the crowd and the people of the Central Coast could bear witness to their monarch, to their head of state. The Queen and Duke spent six months touring the Commonwealth nations, and this was a huge success, demonstrating the dedication she would continue to example throughout her reign as monarch.

That message was titled 'We will meet again'. For those on the front line providing medical care, those transporting our goods and those stocking our shelves, this was a message of inspiration and a message of motivation and encouragement in what was one of the darkest times outside of conflict in our nation's history. As Her Majesty's recognition of those who were grieving, those who were experiencing incredible financial difficulties and those who had had enormous change in their lives, the message was a testament to the steadfast commitment she had for the people of the Commonwealth.

The Queen kept abreast of developing situations in Australia and shared with us in times of celebration as well as commiserated with us during the more challenging periods. This was highlighted during times of national crisis, like the recent bushfires in 2019 and 2020 and during floods that impacted large areas of our country.

For many citizens in Australia and around the world, the Queen represented a constant presence in a rapidly changing world. Here in Australia it has been a time of mixed emotions for many, and this is understandable. However, the outpouring of emotion shown since her passing demonstrates what an extraordinary leader she was. In my electorate, people have come from all over the region to sign the condolence book, republicans and monarchists alike, sharing their unique story and their memories of Her Majesty.

Asia industrialised, and the empire waned in many corners of continents as countries turned into republics. The Queen was there, recognising and accepting the people's will.

During the early COVID pandemic she again gave words of hope and comfort, as she had at so many other times in her life. She assured us we could and would prevail in those frightening times. Indeed, she reminded us that not only could we survive; we could benefit from the hiatus in normal life. Such was her stoicism.

Just two days before her death, obviously frail and in discomfort, she performed her duty to swear in the new Prime Minister, as always with a smile on her face and a light in her eye. To me, this moment is an undeniable emblem of her stoicism and depth of character. It is a moment of deep inspiration, because it was built on an unfailing lifetime of selflessness and duty.

She stood as an inspiration for women for decades, an example of the strength of female leaders, with her leadership style of gentleness and strength, grace and stoicism, and unwavering commitment to her ideals. The Queen was deeply sentimental about Australia. In her royal tour of Australia in 2000, she expressed, 'Whatever the future may bring, my lasting respect and affection—

As the Duke tried to talk to some of the veterans, he had to lean in close to hear them over the roar of the crowd. Following this visit, a film was produced and shown in local theatres. The film has since been shared by the University of Wollongong Library and recently has been on the Lost Wollongong &amp; Yesterday's Stories Facebook page. It is a brilliant piece of history, providing valuable insight to a historic day for our region.

Many other constituents have shared the sense of excitement that overtook the community as the entire region gathered around these historic visits.

The second source of identity comes from the British institutions that underpin our legal system and market economy and bind us together through colonialism, shared sacrifice in war and a common culture. The third river is multiculturalism: our integration of a higher share of migrants than any other advanced nation.

Some may fairly ask, 'Why would the Crown matter to families who do not come from the United Kingdom?' This is the problem with generalities: they turn a blind eye to the virtue and value of tradition in any culture. Migrants come here with eyes and hearts wide open. They come here recognising the role tradition plays in binding us to those who have come before and those who will come after. There is, perhaps, no better example of this than Her Majesty's historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, the first by a reigning monarch in a century, and in the country of my birth.

Not just polite applause but sustained heartfelt appreciation of the bridge that the Queen herself had built … she had the look of a woman for whom the weight of history had just got a lot lighter.

It may seem to be a paradox that an institution headed by a person there by birth can defend democracy. Maybe it is the mark of a first-rate democracy that these two ideas—a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy—work in tandem as they do. In

At the opening of this building, she said:
                                                                                                                       </p>

This is surely one of the characteristics that has attracted so many people to come to Australia …
                                                                                                                       </p>

That restraint is no easy thing. To be absolutely impartial is, arguably, not human. We see it in our newspapers today, with many advocates claiming that their cause is the exception for interference by a monarch. In her restraint, the Queen deferred to the people through their representatives here. In doing so, the Queen gave Australia room to grow and mature as a nation. For that, and on behalf of the people of Menzies, I say thank you.

I was proud to see our representatives from this place fly to your side in your time of grief. We know you will make a fine King. More than that—we know you will defend democracy and you will make your mother proud. I thank the House.

In the last two weeks, it seems much of the world has stopped to mourn the passing of Her Majesty. The depth of love, respect and admiration for the Queen has been felt not just in the Commonwealth but also across the globe. Her Majesty was an inspiration and guiding light to many.

Today it is my privilege to recount memories shared by some of my Durack constituents. One clear recounted memory was of the Queen's visit to Geraldton in 1988. My constituent and much-loved local Barb Thompson was lined up with her husband and baby son. They had all rushed down from the service station they owned, still in their work clothes, and were very excited at the prospect of seeing the Queen. As the Queen passed by, Barb's husband smiled at the Queen and said, 'G'day

Those photos taken at this encounter were published in newspapers right across the country—a very proud moment for Geraldton. Barb recalls the Queen's warm, friendly and genuine manner, as well as her sparkling blue eyes and the beautiful brooch she wore that sparkled in the Gero sun.

She loved her fabulous yellow outfit and recalls thinking, 'Why blend in when you can stand out?'

This was a very exciting sight for Broome, considering most locals were used to seeing pearling boats at the jetty as opposed to royal yachts. Sporting her signature pearl necklace, the Queen spent her time in Broome chatting with locals and admiring the local pearling harvest. It must have been a very proud moment for the Broome pearlers that day, knowing how much the Queen loved and appreciated pearls, something that the Queen and I have in common.

She was a constant, reliable fixture in our lives—for most of us, all our lives. The passing of the Queen is a loss of familiarity. It is a little like losing your favourite auntie or someone very dear to you, an important person in your life.

Her Majesty set an impeccable example in every way, and her attention to detail with her appearance gave us just a bit of an insight into how she managed her duties as our sovereign.
                                                                                                                        </p>

But I'd long thought that it is a real shame that all the good things that people say about someone upon their passing—it would be good if they could say those things when that individual was alive. I only hope that our majesty, our sovereign, our Queen knows just how much she was—is—loved, admired and respected.

She was Queen to us, but she was 'dear Mummy' to him. I wish our King a long life and to be given a chance to fulfil his duty with grace and devotion, just as his mother did before him.

It was just a year after her coronation, in February 1954, when Queen Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit the beautiful island state of Tasmania. Fittingly, it was the year of Tasmania's sesquicentenary. And regional Tasmania wasn't forgotten either. On Tuesday 24 February 1954, Her Majesty, accompanied by her beloved husband, the

There was a royal procession through the small rural towns of Wynyard, Burnie, Penguin, Ulverstone, Devonport and Latrobe. There were official engagements in Burnie and Devonport, and thousands lined the streets to catch just a glimpse of their Queen. When reflecting on her time in Tasmania, the Queen said: 'My stay in Tasmania has, of necessity, been all too short, but we shall carry away happy memories of the charm of your island state and the steadfast kindness of its people.' True to her word, Her Majesty would return to Tasmania a further six times. On 26 April 1988,

It was to be an historic day for the township of Burnie. At a reception at the Burnie Civic Centre, Her Majesty officially handed Mayor Rex Collins the scroll that proclaimed Burnie a city. Again, the streets were lined with wellwishers, excited to catch a glimpse of their Queen.

As a young—much younger—18-year-old, I, too, am eternally proud to have sworn that same oath. For me, and for many others of the Defence Force, tradition and history are the fundamental pillars on which the defence of our nation is built. To loyally serve the people of Australia, and its Queen, is what members of the ADF literally devote their lives to. And there has been no finer role model—no finer role model—when it comes to service and dedication than that of Queen Elizabeth II during her 70-year reign.

I did not get time to look at Prince Philip. My short glimpse revealed a very pretty young lady wearing a small hat and waving a white-gloved hand.
