        Labor believes that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        should constitute the new framework for global international development assistance. The key objectives of the Australian aid program should be to work with developing countries to realise the Millennium Development Goals. The goals allow developing and developed countries to move beyond the sometimes flawed relationship that has characterised overseas aid in the past and provide a clear vision and framework for halving extreme poverty by 2015 and ending it by 2025. Labor accepts the internationally agreed aid volume target of 0.7 per cent of

         GNP
        </a>
        for overseas development assistance, and recently the Leader of the Opposition formally committed a future Rudd Labor government to ensuring that overseas development aid is 0.5 per cent of

        I was very pleased recently to welcome to my electorate office some local members of the

        We had a very fruitful conversation, and it was so pleasing to see so many people in the local community in my electorate committed to wanting to see Australia act as a good international citizen, committed from a personal point of view to always trying to ensure that someone who is not as well off as you are gets a helping hand up, and as far as Australia being a good international citizen is concerned, ensuring that Australia is committed to overseas development aid, is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and committed in an international sense to making poverty history for so many developing nations around the globe at the moment.
