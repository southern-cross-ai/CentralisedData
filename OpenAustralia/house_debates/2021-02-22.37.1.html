       <p>
        On 18 January, I had the honour of presenting William Herbert John Ives, commonly known as Bill, with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         National Medal
        </a>
        for his services to Volunteer Marine Rescue Gladstone. The National Medal recognises long and diligent service by members of voluntary organisations recognised by the government. These men and women give their time, and sometimes risk their lives, to protect and assist the community in times of emergencies and national disasters. They work 24/7, around the clock.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill has been a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMR" rel="nofollow">
         VMR
        </a>
        for over 20 years. He was a deckhand on charter boats and an underwater welderâ€”a very specialised field, I might add. He would go to the VMR daily, always checking equipment. He had a great eye for detail and, if anything was out of place, he would soon tell his comrades of the fact. Unfortunately, Bill has been diagnosed with cancer, which continues to spread throughout his body. Although his health is rapidly deteriorating, he still manages to put on a brave face every day. He is being taken care of full time by his daughter, Maureen. I would like to thank Bill for his years and years of service, and we will keep him and his family in our thoughts and prayers.
