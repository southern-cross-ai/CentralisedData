        I rise to record my appreciation for the 123rd annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Castle Hill
        </a>
        show, which is commencing this Friday at the Castle Hill showground in my electorate. The show runs from this Friday to this Sunday and is open all day, every day, and is a wonderful event that provides a link with the rural and regional history of my area. Indeed, it provides a contemporary experience for the many thousands of new families who have moved into the suburbs of Kellyville and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouse_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The Castle Hill show is an annual fixture in the Hills Shire calendar. It attracts tens of thousands of locals and visitors to my electorate and the show’s success can be measured on many fronts. Most notably, members would agree that 123 annual shows is a cause for great celebration, particularly when you consider that this is a completely voluntary event without any assistance funding, and has never recorded any government assistance of any description.

        A look at the weekend’s schedule gives a good idea of what goes on there. There is a packed program that includes horse events, dog shows, kids dancing, motorcycle demonstrations, sheep mustering, chainsaw demonstrations, fire dancing performances and many other activities. The show also contains its traditional displays of the Hills Shire’s history and its art and crafts and a link to our rural heritage.

        I want to thank and congratulate the members of the Castle Hill District Show Society and the Castle Hill and Hills District Agricultural Society, led by its president, Peter Gooch. I want to thank and record the names of the vice presidents, Judith Adam, Peter Dimbrosky and

        and Rowena Burrough. These management committee members work tirelessly each year. Many of them have served for many years in providing the absolute foundation—the bedrock—that is the success of the show. They put in thousands of hours of their own time and ensure that each year this is a great success for everyone within our district. I want to also congratulate and thank my friends and fellow patrons, including: Michael Richardson MP, Ray Williams MP, Wayne Merton MP and my predecessor, the Hon.

        As a part of the Castle Hill Hills District Show Society, I have worked very hard to ensure that we all support such a great local institution, because it is such a wonderful testimony to the wonderful spirit of the Hills Shire district. We have one of the highest levels of volunteerism in Australia and indeed all of our Lions and Rotary clubs attend this important event and ensure that it is something very special. Fundraising from this event is used to help many disadvantaged sections of our north-west Sydney community. I want to thank again all of the wonderful volunteers for the work that they do—the board, the committee and the management committee—and everyone who attends this weekend and makes it such a fantastic event.
