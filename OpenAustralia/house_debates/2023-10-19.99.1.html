        . How will this week's new skills agreement help address labour shortages for small businesses and build on the government's agenda to support this vital sector?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for that question. I know she, like many people in this House, is excited about the new skills agreement that will unlock billions of dollars for Australian skills. The agreement was announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Skills and Training earlier this week. It will see the Albanese Labor government invest up to $12.6 billion to expand and transform access to the vocational education and training sector and to support quality training. This investment is, of course, on top of fee-free
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         . We've heard from the Minister for Skills and Training just how successful that has been. It has been very well received by small businesses across the country. This skilling package will be transformative for small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         As small business minister, I spend a lot of my time talking to people in small businesses right across the country. Consistently, one of the top concerns they raise is workforce. As the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          National Australia Bank
         </a>
         reported earlier this year, one in three small and medium-sized businesses identified labour shortages as a very significant issue. We have listened, and we're acting. Our skills agreement will help ensure that our small businesses, as well as our big businesses, have the workers they need with—importantly—the skills and qualifications that small businesses need. Small businesses are crying out for skilled labour across this country. The agreement has been welcomed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
         </a>
         , who said it 'has the potential to tackle Australia's crippling shortage of qualified workers'. This is the No. 1 issue that small businesses raise, and we're acting to deliver a more qualified workforce for small businesses right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it is just one of the ways that our government is supporting small businesses. We're also of course providing targeted support through the $20,000 instant asset write-off; the small business energy incentive, with $310 million; and the additional 20 per cent bonus deductions for energy efficiency improvements for small businesses. Of course, this is on top of our targeted energy bill relief that we know small businesses will be receiving. There'll be $650 for the around one million small businesses that will be receiving this payment. Of course, it's something those opposite voted against—that support for small businesses. We're also investing $23.4 million to help small businesses build their resilience in terms of cybersecurity and attacks, through the new Cyber Wardens Program. This will be delivered by the Council of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
          Small Business
         </a>
         Organisations and will help small businesses prepare for attacks and understand what type of threats they have. Of course, we've already delivered the $8.6 million to help small businesses adapt and build resilience through digital technology. We'll continue to listen to small businesses and continue to deliver practical support in a targeted way.
