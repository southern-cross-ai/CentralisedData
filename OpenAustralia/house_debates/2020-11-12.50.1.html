       <p>
        Today I want to acknowledge the great work that not-for-profit groups on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        are doing for their community. Around three years ago a number of these groups got together and formed an organisation called Helping Agencies Network Development, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAND" rel="nofollow">
         HAND
        </a>
        . HAND is a great example of how different helping agencies can work together to have a greater positive impact on their community. Headed up by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Wilson
        </a>
        , HAND is an initiative of the Bribie Island Neighbourhood Centre. Its membership includes the Sandstone Point Lions Club, Rotary, Global Care and many others. Recently I attended one of their meetings and heard firsthand how this type of networking can benefit the wider community. They share knowledge with each other on what their respective organisations have to offer and can refer clients as needed. It's a great example of the willingness of people in our community to become volunteers and support worthwhile causes. The dedication of these organisations that rely on volunteers to keep them going is, frankly, amazing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've seen this networking approach in other parts of my electorate of Longman, too. An organisation called Intercept based in Caboolture has a team of about 20 people and a wide range of different social service programs working together to get the best outcomes for people who are in need of some help. I recognise that this approach is vital in government, too, and I hope that local, state and federal governments can put aside their differences and find some common ground for the betterment of our communities.
