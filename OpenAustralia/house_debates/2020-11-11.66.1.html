        My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison-

        <p>
         I thank the member for Mallee for her question. As a regional member, she knows how important affordable, reliable energy is for regional areas and the important role gas plays in delivering affordable, reliable energy for regional Australia and for all Australians. Of course, she knows that gas plays many roles. It cooks our food. It delivers hot water. It heats our homes. But its roles go well beyond that, because with record levels of investment in renewables in this country it's providing firming for solar and wind, and it also supports the 850,000 Australians who work in manufacturing by providing a feedstock for fertiliser for our farmers as well as plastics for our health workers. And a gas fired recovery is central to this government's approach to recovery from COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're strengthening the gas market to make sure Australian gas is working for all Australians. That's why we're supporting projects like the Santos project at Narrabri. That's why we're supporting the development of the Beetaloo Basin in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
          Top End
         </a>
         , where we see one of the most prospective gas basins in the world. Unlocking those supplies will help to put downward pressure on longer-term prices. Tomorrow the minister for resources and I will lead a round table of gas suppliers and customers to develop the sector's first industry led code of conduct. The code will ensure fair and effective engagement between suppliers and users during contract negotiations. And the winners will be Australian households and businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, not everyone in this place understands or accepts the important role that gas plays in our economy. But the member for Hunter does. He believes it so strongly that he's been forced to move to the backbench. In fact, he's not even here today; I think they've kept him out. He knows that the Labor Party has been walking away from hardworking Australians. He has had enough of the cheesecloth brigade, as he calls them, in the modern Labor Party, who are prepared to walk away from blue-collar workers. And we hear that he's not alone; there's a substantial number within who are very much emboldened.
        </p>
        <p>
         The divisions on that side are growing deeper by the day. They're paralysed by division and indecision as we get on with the job of delivering affordable and reliable energy to all Australians.
