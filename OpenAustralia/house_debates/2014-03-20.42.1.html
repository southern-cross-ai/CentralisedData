        I want to celebrate and pay tribute to the life of Jane Hodson, who first came to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        in 1992, working as a technician for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imparja_Television" rel="nofollow">
         Imparja Television
        </a>
        and later working for 19 years at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Land_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Land Council
        </a>
        in Alice Springs. She was recognised both within and beyond the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLC" rel="nofollow">
         CLC
        </a>
        for her professionalism, dedication and optimism. She epitomised the values of the Land Council. She was hardworking, resolute, loyal, resilient and inspirational and encouraged and supported her work colleagues. Jane was dedicated to ensuring that the history of the traditional owners of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Australia
        </a>
        —and of the Central Land Council itself—was not forgotten. In her 19 years at the CLC, Jane played a pivotal role in organising and publicising events and activities for the Land Council. She had a great capacity for fun, a wicked sense of humour and a bold and lively wit. Her home, which she shared with her partner, Angie, and their much loved son, Michael, was open to their wide circle of friends. She cherished her family—her late father, Chris; mother, Joyce; and sisters, Sally, Sue, Jill and Sarah, and their families. Jane loved her gadgets. She was a wonderful person—a really, really wonderful person, and she loved the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and the people who lived within it. Most of all, though, Jane loved life, and she loved it joyously. Her resilience and fortitude, her sense of humour and her unwavering generosity of spirit were an inspiration. She is much loved, and a never to be forgotten colleague and dear friend.
