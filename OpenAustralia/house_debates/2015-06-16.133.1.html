        I am pleased to make a contribution today to discuss the upcoming ReclinkCommunity Cup. The Reclink Community Cup began in Melbourne some 21 years ago. Games have also been held in my electorate, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henson_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Henson Park
        </a>
        , Sydney, for the past four years. The matches raise funds for Reclink, a fantastic organisation that promotes sporting and artistic programs for young people experiencing disadvantage. Reclink was established in Victoria, in 1990, and now operates nationally. It provides over 4Â½ thousand activities and 80,000 participation opportunities for disadvantaged young people every year. It targets some of our communities' most vulnerable and isolated people, including people experiencing significant mental health challenges, disability, homelessness, substance abuse, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, correctional services and economic hardship. Reclink bases its operations on the importance of sport and the arts in engaging young people.

        The Melbourne event will be held this Sunday at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsternwick_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Elsternwick Park
        </a>
        . Gates open at noon, with bands playing, and the game gets underway at 2.30 pm. The Sydney match will be held on Sunday, 2 August, at Henson Park, Marrickville, in my electorate. Gates open at 11 am. It will, once again, see the music industry based Western Walers take on the media based Sydney Sailors. I will be playing again, after my debut for the Western Walers last year. The Western Walers are yet to win a game; they are old school. They do not win on the field, but they are pretty good fun off the field and play in the spirit in which a social game should be played. In the lead-up, on the Friday night beforehand, I will be participating in a fundraising event at the Newtown Social Club, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FB" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        i radio, once again, raising funds for Reclink to undertake this important work that they do for disadvantaged young people. I hope people can get along there and enjoy the music played on that evening.
