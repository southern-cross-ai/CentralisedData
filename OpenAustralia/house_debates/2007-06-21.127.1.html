       <p>
        As part of the 2007-08 budget, the Howard government has committed an additional $150 million to solar technology. As a result, more households, schools and community groups in Bonner will now be able to install solar panels to bring their electricity costs down as well as contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I commend my colleague the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull

        , Minister for the Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for recently having announced additional funding for the transformation of the government’s popular Photovoltaic Rebate Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1996, the Howard government has invested $2.8 billion to develop practical responses to climate change. An important part of this has been helping local residents to make a difference at a local level. For example, I note that the additional funding will support a doubling of the rebate for solar panels on homes so that residents can claim up to $8,000 of the cost. The new competitive grants scheme for schools and communities will also encourage the installation of solar panels by offering grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of the solar power system. This represents a great opportunity for the local residents and organisations in Bonner and I will be urging the community to take full advantage of this important initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many Australians are eager to protect their environment and reduce the impact of climate change, and the Photovoltaic Rebate Program will help those who are concerned about climate change to take their own action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program is expected to more than double the number of rooftop solar panel systems installed throughout the country over the next five years. Furthermore, it is expected that around 14,000 households will be able to access rebates through the scheme. To help meet the extra demand for solar power systems, the government will also provide training and accreditation to more installers, which is vital to the success of this expanded program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that low-emission energy technologies such as solar power are an extremely important part of Australia’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I offer my full support to the transformed program, as it will not only encourage more people to use low-emission solar photovoltaic technologies but also stimulate the solar industry and research community in their ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of the technologies and to bring the costs down. The many and varied community organisations and schools in Bonner have shown an active interest in better protecting our environment and I am committed to working with local residents and community representatives to encourage a greater use of renewable energy technologies.

        <p>
         I too rise to speak on climate change and how we can all do our small bit to ensure that we lessen the burning of carbons. I fully agree with the member for Bonner, who is one of the few members to acknowledge that climate change exists and is damaging our world. Climate change continues to be a big issue. It is of great importance and many of us are now finding different ways of conserving energy within our own living spaces. Converting our homes to be environmentally friendly is not always affordable. For many people and families the goal of being environmentally friendly is unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though the member for Bonner acknowledged the Minister for the Environment and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
          Water Resources
         </a>
         and the recent policy of assisting people, it is still a goal that is very unattainable for lower-income families. Small gestures such as recycling and conserving water are relatively inexpensive. However, other measures, such as installing energy efficient light bulbs, solar panels and rainwater tanks, can be expensive. An increasing number of households around Australia are finding it difficult to cope. As the cost of housing is now seven times the average annual income, a decrease in housing affordability has placed pressure on the finances of lower- and middle-income families and as such this means less money is available for these families to invest in green energy practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         With housing affordability at such a low, it seems impossible to ask these struggling households to spend more money to convert their homes to green energy practices. State and federal governments must do more to assist these people to transform their homes where possible. Like most of us in this place, I am privileged to be in a situation where I can afford to transform my house into being 100 per cent green through my energy provider. This is not the case for all South Australians or Australians. Most low-income families cannot afford to spend money making their houses more sustainable through energy efficient practices. Lower-income families are more concerned with making sure they have enough money to pay the household bills and place food on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
         To convert a residence to 100 per cent solar energy would cost anywhere between $20,000 to $100,000. This environmental retrofit would include things such as a solar electricity unit, solar hot water, water recycling and rainwater tanks. It is anticipated that, within a decade, housing that does not use energy and water saving devices will be looked upon as second rate and the prices for non-energy efficient houses may drop. Those who have not invested in energy saving practices, such as lower-income households, could be left with a lower return rate on their properties. I encourage all households to look at ways to be energy efficient and ask that Australians get together to help others become green wherever they can. I ask state and federal governments to do all they can to assist lower-income families that perhaps cannot attain the green energy that the rest of us aspire to.
