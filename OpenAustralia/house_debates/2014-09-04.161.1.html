        Members in this place would have heard me speak before about my work with the forgotten Australians and the need for all victims of child sexual abuse to have their voices heard. On 12 November 2012, I welcomed an announcement by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard that a royal commission inquiry would be held into institutional responses to child sex abuse. Although I welcomed this announcement, I, the victims of abuse, and the organisations who support them have been concerned that the 12-month time frame provided in the terms of reference for the inquiry would not be sufficient to ensure the commission is able to meet its objectives. For the past couple of months, sufferers who are yet to tell their stories have been left in limbo as a result of this restricted time frame.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently wrote to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to express my support for the call by the commission's chair, the Hon. Justice
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McClellan" rel="nofollow">

        , for an inquiry extension. In this letter I stated that I am aware that the Prime Minister was very supportive of the establishment of a royal commission inquiry, which has provided a mechanism for those who did not have a voice to not only share their stories but regain some semblance of control over the abuse that they suffered. I went on to state that an extension to the royal commission's inquiry, and the implementation of an independent national redress scheme, are key steps that this government should take to give sufferers of abuse and neglect the closure they need and to send a message to perpetrators, both past and present, that society and government will not tolerate a repeat of this sorry period.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has answered this call for an extension and has committed up to an additional $125 million to fund the work of the commission for a further two years. This extension will allay the fears of those who have not yet had the opportunity to tell their stories to the commission and will ensure that their voices are heard. The extension will give the commission the capacity to hear more stories from victims, to conduct additional public hearings, and to issue additional interim reportsâ€”with the final report and its recommendations to be delivered to the government by 15 December 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the royal commission's interim report, which was released on 30 June, many people have already shared their experience of abuse by attending a private session or providing a written account to the commission. I encourage all those who have suffered abuse to join with these people and engage with the commission.

        I recently had the pleasure of officially opening knowmore legal service's Perth office, who provide free legal advice and information for any member of the public who is considering telling their story or providing information to the royal commission. This not-for-profit organisation is funded by a grant from the federal government, represented by the Attorney-General's Department. Speaking with knowmore's executive officer, Jenny Hardy, at the launch highlighted the need for this extension, with this one support service alone providing more than 4,000 advices and having conducted more than 300 outreach community engagement events across the country since they opened their Sydney office in July last year. To date, 11 per cent of their services have also been provided to clients in my home state of

        </a>
        , and this was before their permanent office had even been established. It is organisations such as this that we need to ensure a royal commission of this magnitude is met with sensitivity and has appropriate support networks available for those who need them. Implementing a royal commission inquiry into what has historically been a 'too hard' and ignored subject is an achievement in itself, but to gain a further extension is a credit to the current government, all those who have had the courage to tell their stories and the many organisations across Australia who have supported the inquiry on behalf of those who, until now, have had no justice, no protection and no voice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people do not understand the journey of those who have suffered emotional, physical and sexual abuse or the trauma they relive when telling their stories. I am pleased to be part of a government that understands the need for victims to have a voice, when for too long they have suffered in silence, and will provide additional funding to ensure the commission can complete its work. I say to all those people who rallied for the extension: well done. Your voice was heard in Canberra and the Prime Minister and this government have extended the royal commission as you requested. You should pat yourselves on the back for the efforts you made to get that extension.
