        [by video link] On Wednesday 24 November, it was 14 years since I first had the honour of being elected by the people of Blair. After the 2007 federal election, a newly elected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">
         Labor government
        </a>
        introduced many reforms, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        , paid parental leave, the education revolution, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        and aged-care reform. We apologised to the stolen generations, addressed the scourge of institutional abuse against children and removed the draconian industrial measures,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
         Work Choices
        </a>
        . In Blair, locally, we upgraded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich Motorway
        </a>
        and the Blacksoil Interchange. The Fernvale Indoor Sports Centre and the Somerset Civic Centre were both built. We delivered a cancer clinic and invested in community, cultural and educational infrastructure such as the Orion Lagoon and the Robelle Domain parklands, all in Springfield. Those opposite have very little to boast about for their more than eight years in government.
       </p>

        The last two years have been particularly difficult for community groups and businesses across Blair. As we cautiously open our borders and businesses, the community is enjoying coming together. However, not everything goes to plan. Regular Christmas events here were not just victims of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021; they've also been postponed and cancelled in storms. One such victim is the Rosewood Lions Christmas carnival. I was looking forward to attending this last weekend and having a stall on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Street" rel="nofollow">
         John Street
        </a>
        . The cancellation notwithstanding, I offer my sincere appreciation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Rosewood; the event coordinator, Dennis Kenyon; and former local councillor David Pahlke for their hard work and organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was fortunate to attend an event with the Ipswich Prostate Cancer Support Group, run by cancer survivor Dennis Ellis. The group raised $6,000, and I was pleased to support the event by buying a table and sharing the event with some good mates, family and colleagues. My father, Al, had prostate cancer, and it caused his death. I appreciate the work of this group to support men and their families, and to raise awareness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've enjoyed getting out and about across Blair to visit groups that have recently received the Blair stronger communities grants. I recently visited the Ipswich Switches Junior Motorcycle Speedway Club at Willowbank, with Cameron Jeppesen, to see the new lap-timing technology in action. I congratulate the club president, Dwayne Rew, and hardworking volunteer Cam for their great work.
       </p>

        Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the Linville Heritage Festival in the north-western part of the Somerset region. I had the privilege of opening stage 2 of the Linville Community Garden. I congratulate Carolyn Barker and the association for their dedication to the project and their tenacity in organisation. And I congratulate them for the work they do across the northern part of Blair. Thank you very much to all those organisations for dealing not just with the challenges of COVID but the storms recently.
