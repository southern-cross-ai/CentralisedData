       <p>
        I rise today to speak on the future of the Ipswich CBD. Sadly, while the city of Ipswich has thrived, the Ipswich CBD has suffered. With major population and industry growth in the Ipswich corridor, it is important that Ipswich has a CBD that reflects its important future and position in the Queensland economy. I am pleased to announce that all three levels of government—federal, state, and council—are committed to revitalising the CBD and forging a blueprint for Ipswich’s future as a liveable city. A revamped CBD will boost the city’s economy, create jobs and draw residents and visitors into the inner city.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new Rudd Labor government promised at the last election that $10 million would go towards the Ipswich CBD, in particular for seed money for a new football stadium, a Southbank-style lagoon and a performing arts centre. We also committed to establishing a

        superclinic in the heart of Ipswich and a defence families healthcare clinic. These will be enormous investments in the Ipswich CBD and, together with the council’s Ipswich Integrated Strategy and Action Plan, will breathe new life into Ipswich. These plans, announced by the Queensland state Labor government, will inject an enormous amount of potential into Ipswich. A new transport hub will also add value to the Ipswich CBD.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say there is another significant boost to the CBD with the redevelopment of the historic Ipswich

        building and the adjoining land between Brisbane and Limestone streets. The new project will be called Tower Central. It will have cafes, shops and professional offices. The original Post Office building is significant from a cultural heritage perspective as it is one of only three surviving grand post offices built in Queensland at the time of Federation. An extra 200 workers as well as public servants will work in the Ipswich CBD. I am pleased to announce that I have met with Anita Birtcher and Kathryn Meland from

        and the Queensland state Labor government, I am confident we will see a renaissance in the Ipswich CBD.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the re-election of Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale and Deputy Mayor Victor Attwood, both prominent Labor Party figures, on 15 March 2008. I will work with them and the local member for Ipswich, state Labor MP Rachel Nolan, to revitalise the Ipswich CBD. I also congratulate
