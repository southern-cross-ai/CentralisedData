        I rise today to talk about the young people in my electorate of Gorton. Earlier this year I conducted a youth survey, as I wanted to hear directly about issues most important to them. In reading through the results it became evident that there were pressing issues they felt strongly about and challenges that we cannot ignore.
       </p>
       <p>
        First and foremost, education and skills were identified as a key priority. I was pleased to see that the Albanese Labor government's fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        policy was overwhelmingly supported. These young people in my electorate recognise the importance of accessible vocational education as a catalyst for their personal growth and the prosperity of our society. Also apparent was support for Australia's commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions. Young Australians understand the urgent need to address the climate crisis and they're eager to see bold and decisive action taken to secure a sustainable future for generations to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, there was strong support for the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        peoples.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_people" rel="nofollow">
         Young people
        </a>
        in my electorate understand the importance of acknowledging and honouring the rich Indigenous heritage of our nation and striving for genuine reconciliation. Many of them have already signed up to volunteer on the yes campaign and I look forward to working alongside them to achieve this historic milestone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondents also highlighted their concerns for the future. Cameron from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keilor_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        believed that he would have of a lower standard of living, economically, than his parents because of stagnant wage growth this country has faced. This is something the government is focused on addressing. Jess from Sydenham believed that younger people need more support to set up their lives with secure work and more affordable housingâ€”again, two areas of public policy that we are looking to respond to and fix.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was scepticism about the prospect of ever owning a house. Nearly 90 per cent of the young people surveyed did not believe that owning a home was realistic, which, again, underlines a real concern amongst young people about their opportunities in the future. It's something we need to tackle both at a federal and a state level. This deeply rooted concern demands our attention and reinforces the necessity of the Housing Australia Future Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May my office initiated more intensive discussions with individuals and small groups of young people. Through these conversations the passion and dedication of many young people in my electorate shone through. Young people are actively engaged in broader issues that affect our society at large. Our future generations are in good hands. It is our responsibility to encourage them to participate in the big issues that are shaping their future and that of their communities and country.
