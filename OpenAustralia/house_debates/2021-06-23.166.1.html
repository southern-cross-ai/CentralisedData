        The electorate of Perth will soon change. Following a redistribution we are going to welcome some other great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n suburbs and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        residents to the Perth electorate. Not everyone in this place welcomes a redistribution, but I welcome the new residents of the Perth electorate. These are iconic Western Australian suburbs that continue to reside on Boorloo, Whadjuk and Noongar land.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Osborne Park
        </a>
        , a suburb named after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Osborne" rel="nofollow">
         William Osborne
        </a>
        , who was elected to the Perth Road Board in 1875. William Osborne was a butcher who owned land in the Wanneroo area. When it was first settled, Osborne Park had an emerging agricultural tradition and many Italian and Chinese migrants. It has the swamplands of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Monger" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Monger
        </a>
        , which is also known as Galup, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herdsman_Lake" rel="nofollow">
         Herdsman Lake
        </a>
        , which is known as Njookenbooro, meaning that freshwater was abundant. Today while diverse communities still exist, Osborne Park is known for its many commercial outlets and retains its industrial trading hub feel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joondanna, initially named Joondanna Heights, was settled after the Perth Road Board launched a competition to find a suitable name in 1939. The competition was won by Mrs A Curtis of Donnybrook. Today Joondanna is home to many young families. Again it's another great Western Australian suburb.
       </p>
       <p>
        We then have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuart_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Tuart Hill
        </a>
        . It was almost named Grenville. People were concerned that it might be confused with Granville in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        so the name Tuart Hill was settled upon, recognising the majestic tuart trees that grow throughout the area. Tuart Hill is still a blooming, green, leafy suburb. The community is warm and welcoming. I have been pleased to be able to doorknock throughout Tuart Hill in the month of May. We have Yokine, derived from the local Whadjuk Noongar word meaning 'dingo'. Yokine experienced a housing boom after World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , and the area near the golf course was almost entirely developed by the 1950s. By the seventies, Yokine was practically full. Today it continues to be a beautiful and popular suburb in the northern suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        These suburbs are home to great community organisations, some of which I've had the pleasure to meet, others which I look forward to meeting in coming months and years: the Main Street Co-op, the Osborne Park Cricket Club, its twin organisation the Osborne Park Bowling Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        Masters WA, the Western Australian Golf Club, Maccabi Soccer Club, Exceed Triathlon Club, Osborne Autumn Club and the WA Tuart Hill branch of Retirees. This is a beautiful part of the world. I welcome everyone who lives in these suburbs that are about to join the Perth electorate following the next election. Thank you to the

        for giving me these beautiful parts of Western Australia.
