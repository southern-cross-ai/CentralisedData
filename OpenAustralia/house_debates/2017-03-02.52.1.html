       <p>
        Over the past two weeks, we have seen a series of revelations that show that this blundering Attorney-General, inexplicably kept on the front bench by this Prime Minister, has once again misled this parliament. It is less than six months since Senator Brandis's last misleading of the parliament was uncovered, when he claimed to have consulted the former Solicitor-General about his new legal services direction. That was entirely false. Last week, Western Australian Attorney-General Michael Mischin caught the Attorney-General out in his cover-up of the Bell matter. The Attorney-General told the parliament last November, in what he claimed was a full explanation, that the first he became 'personally involved' in a dirty deal with his WA Liberal mates, which could have dudded the Commonwealth taxpayer of $300 million, was on 3 March last year. That turned out to be completely untrue. Mr Mischin says that Senator Brandis spoke to him about the Bell deal in early February—a month earlier. Now the Attorney-General is trying the oldest trick in the book in saying he 'can't recall' having that conversation with Mr Mischin. Some may think this Attorney-General is providing comic relief with his constant stuff-ups, but the truth is he is a danger to good lawmaking, a danger to the workings of this parliament and a danger to the rule of law. Do Australia a favour, Mr Turnbull—do something popular for once: do not pack this failing Attorney-General off to London; make him resign.

         I remind the member for Isaacs to refer to members by their correct titles—handy just before question time. I refer to his last sentence.
