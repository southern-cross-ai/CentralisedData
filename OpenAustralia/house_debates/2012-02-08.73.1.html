        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement that the staffer responsible for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        disturbance at the Lobby restaurant acted alone. Can the Prime Minister explain why staff in her media unit briefed the press gallery on Australia Day that the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for the disturbance when they knew that to be false?

         On the member's question, it is true to form that we see the opposition throwing around allegations for which they can produce no proof. I have dealt with these matters on the public record and I will deal with them again. Mr Hodges made a very grave error in judgment. He has paid a price for that error in judgment.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was not asked about the actions of Mr Hodges; she was asked about the actions of her media unit. That is the question she should be answering.

            I would have thought if the opposition were truly interested then it would wait for the details of the matter—and the details do matter—and making things up does not work. What happened, as I have said publicly, is that Mr Hodges acted alone. He was not authorised in his actions. It was a bad error of judgment and he has paid a price for that. No-one was more angry than me that something to honour people who had done remarkable things in times of natural disaster and other circumstances when Australians needed aid was disrupted. In terms of what Mr Hodges and Ms Sattler said in their telephone conversation, I would refer the opposition to Ms Sattler's statements, which verify that Mr Hodges told Ms Sattler that Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, had said that people should move on from the tent embassy—

              The comments of the Leader of the Opposition from earlier that morning were accurately relayed from Mr Hodges to Ms Sattler. In the aftermath of the incident, what my staff did was first and foremost ascertain the whereabouts of each of my staff members because I was concerned about their safety. I also personally ascertained the whereabouts of Senator Lundy and Minister McClelland because they were at the Lobby restaurant and, as television cameras spectacularly recorded, we left them behind. So I wanted to know that they were okay. In the aftermath of the incident, that was our first and foremost concern. The allegation that I or anybody on my behalf—
