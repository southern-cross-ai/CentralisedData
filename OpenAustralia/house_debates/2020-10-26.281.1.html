        There is no greater privilege than standing in this place and talking about a local person who is an inspiration. Today I want to talk about Janelle Crossett and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Russell Jones
        </a>
        , the recipients of the 2020 Elizabeth Tudor Award from OzChild. Nell and Russ have been foster carers since early 2015, and the two siblings that came into their care then remain with them today. They are such strong advocates for the children in their care and they navigate through challenging times to ensure that the children's voices are heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the face of adversity Nell presents to those around her as a positive and reliable source of direction and comfort. Her resilience and the high value she places on education is a wonderful example to the children in her care. Nell volunteers her time at foster care information sessions and carer training to share her experience with those considering becoming a foster carer. Russ cooks with the children and treasures the time they spent hiking, bike riding and exploring together during their recent trip around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last 12 months, though, their family has experienced major highs and lows. I can attest to the fact that they have continued to provide unwavering love, commitment and support to the children. Thank you, Nell and Russ, for everything you do for the children in your care, and thank you for reaching out in April for help. I am so proud and pleased to see how well you're now doing.
