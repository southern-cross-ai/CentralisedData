        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        proposes to undertake urgent security and refurbishment works, at an estimated cost of $27.7 million, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The works are part of a program of priority security enhancements and chancery relocations currently being carried out by the government across a range of posts, to ensure the safety of staff and visitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The security works on the chancery will be substantial and intrusive. The chancery is 28 years old and there will be operational efficiencies and savings if a mid-life base building refurbishment is integrated with the security works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has carefully considered the nature of the security works proposed and has decided that the project is urgent and should not be delayed by referral to the Public Works Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        A proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much supports the work of the Public Works Committee and has not taken this decision lightly. However, design work has been completed and it is important that the works should go to tender without delay.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, works will commence on site in December this year with completion by April 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the motion to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.

       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Extension and accommodation upgrade to the existing Chancery of the Australian Embassy in Beijing, China.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct an extension to the Australian Chancery in Beijing, China, and to upgrade chancery accommodation and services at an estimated cost of $21.61 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has occupied the existing chancery since 1992. As a result of significantly increased representation by the Australian government in China, the chancery no longer meets present-day requirements including space availability, efficiency, and building and workplace codes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal meets the government’s preference to provide a consolidated and secure facility for all Australian government agencies represented in Beijing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government owns the chancery in Beijing located on property that is leased under a reciprocal arrangement with the Chinese government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The newly upgraded chancery will fully provide for the embassy’s functional and security requirements into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this work should proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts and will implement those recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will begin in September 2008 with practical completion and occupation scheduled for October 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
