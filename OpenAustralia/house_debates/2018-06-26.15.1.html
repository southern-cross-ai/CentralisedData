        My electorate has always been home to some of Sydney's most important contributors to the cultural life of our cityâ€”be it writers, musicians or artists. Inspired by our harbourside location, it's a tradition that dates back thousands of years, as the rock carvings of the Cammeraygal people still remind us in places like Balls Head. It's a tradition that is alive and well today. This was evident at the opening of the new Gallery

        + Creative Studios, which I attended last weekend. I want to congratulate Lane Cove Council for their vision and work to support local artists through the creation of this new centre and the studio committee for their work in bringing it to fruition.

        The studio is located in the heart of Lane Cove in a building that started life as a bicentennial project. It was originally a community centre. It has now been entirely converted to a creative space, which I know will be well used by the local community. The new facility provides space for pottery, printmaking, photography, textiles and other arts activities, supported by teaching rooms and artist-in-residence spaces. Some of the most important local artists have been recognised through the naming of different studios within the building, including Elizabeth Rooney, Joy Warren and

        </a>
        . As Saturday's open day demonstrated, the studios will be well used by residents of all ages, but it will be particularly important in introducing local children to the various art forms it supports. It will be an important addition to the cultural landscape of our area and a wonderful creative hub.
