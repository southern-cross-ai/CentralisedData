        The Forde electorate is home to a great many exceptional and innovative people whom I am privileged to represent in this House. Recently there have been two community members who deserve a special mention. The first, Alice Dobson of Beenleigh, celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and relatives at the Beenleigh Senior Citizens Centre, the largest seniors centre in Australia. I was honoured to speak to Mrs Dobson about her achievements in life and to join in celebrating this momentous occasion and sharing birthday congratulations from the Queen, the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. When asked what the secret to a long and happy life was she stated, 'Stay positive and keep active.'
       </p>

        Another constituent in my electorate, Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Young
        </a>
        , had a successful outcome when he represented Australia at the 2011 Blind Powerlifter World Championships in Turkey last month. It was a pleasure to visit Mr Young for the second time to congratulate him on his bronze medal. Mr Young also succeeded in breaking two world records for the bench press and is going to Orlando for the world championships in 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Young is a legally blind Indigenous athlete who has been competing in blind powerlifting for 25 years. In 11 trips to the world championships, he has won eight world titles and been runner-up twice. I continue to stay in contact with Mr Young and to aid him in finding the extra funding he needs for next year's events.
