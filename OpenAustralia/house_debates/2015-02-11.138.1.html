        I rise to speak about a constituent, Shirley Donaldson. Shirley died on 13 November. She was 86 years old. Shirley Donaldson was a stalwart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . Shirley was an elder of the

        /Rockingham branch and, together with her husband, John, a life member of the Australian Labor Party. Life membership is an honour bestowed on very few people, and very few party members, in recognition of their outstanding service to the Labor movement. Shirley certainly was a worthy recipient.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley was involved in the Labor Party for more than 60 years in Willagee, Yangebup and then Rockingham. Shirley became good friends with numerous state and federal politicians, including

       <p>
        The former Western Australian Premier, Alan Carpenter, accredited Shirley and her husband, John, with introducing him to the Labor Party. It was they who suggested he join and look to a political career. They were incredibly proud when Alan was selected to be the Premier of Western Australia when

        retired from politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley was a very active member of the party. She and John would walk the pavement doorknocking and delivering pamphlets during many election campaigns, including all of mine. She attended the innumerable meetings, events and fundraisers that make up the Labor political calendar. Her vigour and commitment demonstrated her belief in the democratic process, in social justice, in the rights and equality of all people and in Labor values.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley always looked for the best in people and lived by the motto 'If you can't make friends, then don't make enemiesâ€”unless, of course, they are Liberals'. She was a charming and delightful person. She was kind, warm, hospitable, friendly and good humoured.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley and her husband, John, were soul mates for 72 years, from the very first time Shirley caught John's eye was when she was just 14 years old and they both worked at Watson's in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . My thoughts are with her husband, John, her three children, her nine grandchildren and her 16 great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley Donaldson was an extraordinary woman. She led an extraordinary life. She was proud to support her community through her political action and participation and proud to be a Labor member, and we are proud of Shirley.
