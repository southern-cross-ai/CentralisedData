        provider in my electorate, Eurella Community Services. I recently visited their centre in Burwood to learn more about what they do. Eurella has supported people with disabilities in our community for over 65 years, including those with autism and intellectual disabilities. Their programs are available across the lifespan, from childhood through to later stages of life. Eurella offers programs such as lifelong learning and life-skills programs, supported employment, shared living accommodation and other supported independent living options for adults.

        As a psychologist who has worked in the disability space and one with a PhD in autism spectrum disorder, I understand the value that services like Eurella offer the community. I'm particularly pleased that the Morrison government was able to provide just over $15,000 for Eurella for the upgrade of outdoor facilities through the Stronger Communities program. Close by, in

        , Eurella Packaging and Assembly employ those with a disability, providing an opportunity to participate in meaningful work.

        This month, the Morrison government has outlined a plan to address the key concerns of NDIS participants and providers to make sure the NDIS is accessible, collaborative and financially sustainable. Additionally, the Senate has recently announced a parliamentary inquiry into autism. We want to work with providers like Eurella, an organisation with substantial experience, to meet the needs of NDIS participants so they have greater choice and control in their lives.
