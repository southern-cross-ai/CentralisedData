       <p>
        On this beautiful day in Canberra, I want to take the opportunity to add my total support to the recent announcement by the Prime Minister of the federal government’s intention to help fund chaplains in schools. This is a good news story and a very important development in the way in which we offer help for the wellbeing and support of students throughout Australian schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        As honourable members know, the Prime Minister recently announced that we will invest up to $30 million annually for three years to support chaplains in schools by making available a payment of up to $20,000. What is important about this initiative is that we will support schools that do not have a chaplain by allowing them to apply for this program. Schools that have a chaplain can also apply for the $20,000 payment to help fund this important role within schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today in the parliament I particularly want to acknowledge and inform the parliament about a great chaplaincy service that has been going on in my electorate of Aston for a number of years. I refer particularly to the Knox Chaplaincy Committee, which supports the chaplain at a great secondary college in Aston, Scoresby Secondary College. A chaplain was introduced at Scoresby Secondary College in 1989. Until last year, Scoresby was the only school supporting a chaplain in my region. I want the parliament to know that the chaplain is highly valued in the school, for many reasons. A primary focus of the chaplain’s role, of course, is pastoral care. The chaplain affirms and listens to students and seeks to empower them to make life choices—important choices. Where appropriate, the chaplain encourages students to reflect on the spiritual dimension of life and is able to affirm students in their faith and encourage them to build strong relationships with and within their faith communities. Most importantly, the chaplain assists students—and not only students, but also the staff at the school, because quite often they need support—in the areas of grief, loss, family breakdown, anger management, bullying, self-esteem, motivation and all those important dynamics that are needed in this day and age.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have attended Scoresby Secondary College many times and I know the chaplain there. I have seen firsthand the wonderful work that she has done in the Scoresby Secondary College school community. It is for that reason that I know that the recent announcement by the federal government of new funding for school chaplains in Australian schools is a positive, much-needed development that will help people. I am very pleased to see this development.
