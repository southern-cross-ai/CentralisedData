         I just happen to have something that you will be interested in! I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. She has been able to provide me with from Beaconsfield Primary School a commemorative plaque which reads: ‘A souvenir of action between
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Colleoni" rel="nofollow">
           Bartolomeo Colleoni
          </a>
         </i>
         resulting in the sinking of the Italian cruiser.’ As far as I am aware, this is the only such souvenir, though there may be others. In the context of my discussions over the last few months this is the only item that I have seen actually from the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and we understand it to be a part of the funnel damaged in that battle with the
         <i>
          Colleoni
         </i>
         off Cape Spada in Crete on 19 July 1940. I want to thank the member for Fremantle and also the member for Brand for bringing this to my attention. The member for Brand, of course, hosts

         More importantly, on the 11th of the 11th 67 years ago HMAS

         departed Fremantle. She departed Fremantle escorting the troopship
         <i>
          Zealandia
         </i>
         . On 17 November she transferred that responsibility to the British ship
         <i>
          Durban
         </i>
         and she was to have returned to Perth on 20 November, and we know that she never arrived. She was sunk by the German raider
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSK" rel="nofollow">
          HSK
         </a>
         <i>

         </i>
         on 19 November, with the loss of 645 crew.
        </p>
        <p>
         You recall that after searching for this vessel earlier this year there was a national commemorative service at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
          St Andrews
         </a>
         in Sydney on 24 April. On 16 April a small ceremony off the
         <i>
          Anzac
         </i>
         had been held over the site of the sinking of the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . Next week on 19 November there will be a series of national events. One of those will be at the Geraldton War Cemetery, where we will lay to rest a sailor believed to have come from the HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney II
         </i>
         , whose remains were exhumed from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         . After significant efforts at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         testing family members of crew members from the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         , we have yet to identify this person. However, he is to be buried at the war cemetery in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Queens Park
         </a>
         on the 19th at Geraldton. Significantly, on that day we will be holding on board HMAS
         <i>
          Manoora
         </i>
         , over the site of the HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney II
         </i>
         , a service which will be for family members of the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . Two hundred and eighty family members will be on board for this service. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Geraldton" rel="nofollow">
          City of Geraldton
         </a>
         -Greenough will also host their annual sunset memorial service at the Dome of Souls at Geraldton on the 19th.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 27 October I advised all members of a series of national events including ones to be held here in Canberra, in Sydney, in Brisbane, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and in Fremantle. I would encourage members to attend if they possibly can. I would also advise that the member for Brand is very active in this area. He is organising a display at his community stall on the 15th and 16th in addition to the commemorative service and presentation planned for 19November. This is a very important memento of Australian history and I would encourage members when they are contemplating the sinking of the
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         and the loss of those 645 souls to understand the bravery with which those men served and the honour that they have brought to this nation.
