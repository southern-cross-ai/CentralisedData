       <p>
        I would like to praise a small business in my electorate that has taken the initiative to use the Industry Skills Fund growth stream set up by the Assistant Minister for Education and Training,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Birmingham
        </a>
        . Purcell's Engineering were successful in their application to have their training program jointly funded. Our government has granted the business nearly $24,000, or 50 per cent, of the cost they need for their training projects to operate. The business will be able to use this funding to provide improved skills to their employees, which will enable them to continue producing quality work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Industry Skills Fund was set up to help businesses like Purcell's invest in training and support services and to develop innovative training solutions. I met with the business owner, Terry Purcell. He has praised the program and thinks it is very worthwhile continuing such a program. The program has given Purcell's a more skilled and efficient workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am promoting the initiative of Purcell's Engineering because they have taken a proactive attitude and are finding the program very beneficial. I am hopeful that other businesses in my electorate will follow the example of Purcell's Engineering and use this fund to help upskill their employees, which will upskill the business and return good economies to the city of Gladstone.
