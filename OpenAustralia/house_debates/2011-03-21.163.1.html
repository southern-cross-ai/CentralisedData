       <p>
        Tonight I wish to update the House about the unfolding flood situation in the Illawarra and in my electorate of Throsby. Over the past 72 hours the Illawarra has been buffeted by torrential rain, with many areas receiving the equivalent of an entire average monthly rainfall over the past two days.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Albion Park
        </a>
        , one of the suburbs in my electorate, has been hit especially hard. It has recorded over 260 millimetres of rain since 9 am today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we have seen serious levels of flash flooding that has inundated many houses, cut off roads, shut down public transport and left many people, including school students, stranded away from their homes. Many parents spent anxious hours today waiting to negotiate floodwaters to reach their stranded kids. Unfortunately, there will be many kids in my electorate of Throsby who will be sleeping somewhere in their school tonight because their parents have been unable to reach them because transport has been cut off due to the rising floodwaters. There have been reports of cars being swept away from the roads as waters rose too quickly for motorists to escape. Not surprisingly, there have been evacuations in some flood affected areas. Floodwaters that inundated homes in suburbs like Albion Park and Warilla forced residents to seek refuge with families and friends on higher ground in surrounding suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most tragically, I have to inform the House that the floods have already resulted in a loss of life. Late this afternoon police recovered the body of a man who was reportedly swept into a swollen creek in Warilla. I am advised that the man was swept away while attempting to assist people to cross the road in a flood-inundated street. I know I speak on behalf of all members of the local community when I say that our heartfelt condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the man who lost his life and to the entire community in Warilla.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously the situation is of deep concern and very frightening for all of those caught up in it, and it is continuing to develop quite rapidly. Even tonight as I speak, the local authorities are reporting that it is high tideâ€”the most dangerous time in many of the suburbs which surround the lake and the coastal areas as well. At times like this it is vitally important to follow the advice of all of our emergency services, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , and the advice that is being relayed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        , the Roads and Traffic Authority and the Department of Education and avoid taking unnecessary risks in what is still a very volatile and dangerous situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity to commend the role that is being played by the local media.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        have been reporting regularly and providing the community with updates, as have the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illawarra_Mercury" rel="nofollow">
          Illawarra Mercury
         </a>
        </i>
        on their internet site. I commend all local residents to follow the directions that are being provided by the police and other emergency services. I also take this opportunity to commend the work that is being performed by SES volunteers. The crews have responded magnificently. Over the last 42 hours there have been around 1,000 requests for assistance, including 470 requests today alone. I commend each and every one of these volunteers, who continue to do an outstanding job for the local community in terrible weather conditions, providing a much-needed helping hand to those battling the full brunt of nature. We know that they will be working around the clock and through the night to provide emergency assistance to those who are in the greatest need.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are difficult and dangerous times, and I am advised that the circumstances are likely to get worse before they improve. To the people of Throsby, especially those residents in the Illawarra who are being directly affected by the floods, I take the opportunity to wish everybody the very best and ask that they stay safe and wait for the storm to pass, as it inevitably will. I know that all local government representatives will do their best to work together to assist the local community in their time of need.

         I am sure honourable members would wish me to associate the House with the remarks of the member for Throsby. We hope that those in the Illawarra have a safe night and good morrow.
