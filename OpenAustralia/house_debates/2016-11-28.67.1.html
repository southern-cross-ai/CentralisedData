        My question is to the Prime Minister. Did the Attorney-General verbally instruct the Solicitor-General not to run a particular argument in the Bell case in the High Court? Prime Minister, this is not covered by the Attorney-General's statement in the Senate today, and the Attorney-General has said on Sky News today, 'I'm not going into that matter.'

         During the motion that was raised earlier today denouncing the Attorney-General over this matter—which was being moved, of course, before he had even completed his statement to the Senate on it, showing the shadow Attorney-General's high regard for due process and natural justice—I was turning to talk to my colleagues and I heard the words, 'The Attorney-General is a disgrace.' I did not need to turn around to see who had said that; it is always the member for Isaacs.

         MP's jabot has there been such a shameful sort of enmity in the bar common room. It is relentless. You can set your clock on a denunciation of the Attorney-General. The fact of the matter is the Attorney-General has set out a comprehensive statement of events. The shadow Attorney-General is asking me what transpired in a conversation between two distinguished members of the bar at which I was not present. Obviously I do not know what transpired between them, but the Attorney-General has set out his account of the events. It is completely comprehensive and I refer honourable members to it. I really hope that, in the spirit of Christmas and goodwill, the member for Isaacs will find something good about the Attorney-General and perhaps may think kindly of his fellow QC. Surely there must be something that can bring them together at this happy time of year.
