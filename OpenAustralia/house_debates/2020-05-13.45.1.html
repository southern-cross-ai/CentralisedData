       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge and thank the community in my electorate of Curtin for their response to COVID-19. Over the last couple of months we've all had to make some quite extraordinary changes to our lives so that we can slow the growth and beat the virus. As I said in my first speech, Curtin is home to hardworking, strong and resilient people—people who care for each other, are generous and open-hearted. True to form, the Curtin community has stepped up to the challenges. Most importantly, we have looked out for each other.

        Many of our local businesses have adapted their operating models to continue to operate in some way and continue to keep people employed. Our community groups have taken active steps to stay connected with people through technology, videoconferencing and other things.

        , has taken a leading role in promoting local businesses and local initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've also seen local residents assisting those who are vulnerable with various tasks, including grocery shopping, welfare calls, garden maintenance and donating essential items. I am proud and honoured to represent the people of Curtin.
