       <p>
        I would like to inform the House of a very significant award which has been presented to a high school in my electorate. On 19 August 2008
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coates" rel="nofollow">
         John Coates
        </a>
        , the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Olympic Committee
        </a>
        , announced that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfields_Sports_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Westfields Sports High School
        </a>
        had been awarded the prestigious Sport and Youth trophy by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         International Olympic Committee
        </a>
        . The Sport and Youth trophy is aimed at rewarding organisations that have promoted or developed sporting or educational programs linked to the Olympics at a very young age. Westfields of course was the first sports high school in Australia. It has become recognised not only in Australia but in Europe and Asia as the best practice model for sports high schools. It has been classed a project of national significance by the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased to be able to invite John Coates and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Knight" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Knight
        </a>
        , the former New South Wales Minister for the Olympics, to Westfields Sports High School a few years ago to show them the work that is being done by the school in producing future Olympians. It is fair to say that John Coates was extremely impressed. I was delighted that he nominated Westfields Sports High School to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC" rel="nofollow">
         IOC
        </a>
        . I am delighted that they have received this award.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Coates said when he was announcing the award:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Westfields has long been regarded as a great nursery for young sportsmen and women in Australia and the IOC has formally recognized this.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is right. A quick glance at Westfields Sports High School tells you what sort of Australians it has produced: from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kewell" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Kewell
        </a>
        , the international soccer player, to Australian cricket vice-captain
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Clarke
        </a>
        . I would like to inform the House that Westfields Sports High School produced no fewer than six members of the Olympic team in Beijing. I will be very surprised if there is any other high school in Australia that can claim six members of the Olympic team. They were:

        and

         Fabrice Lapierre
        </a>
        in athletics;

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carney" rel="nofollow">
         David Carney
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_McClenahan" rel="nofollow">
         Trent McClenahan
        </a>
        in football; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bates" rel="nofollow">
         Kate Bates
        </a>
        in cycling.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you can tell, I am very proud of Westfields Sports High School, as was Mr Coates when he announced the award. It is important to note that not only does Westfields produce excellence on the sporting field but, as I often say, the culture of excellence rubs off in other achievements. The 2007
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        results are an indication of this, with the dux of Westfields Sports High School receiving an HSC score of 99.6 and two students receiving the Premierâ€™s Distinguished Achievers award. This is a tribute to the students of Westfields Sports High School; to its founding principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Tucker" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Tucker
        </a>
        , who is now retired; to its current principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Roger Davis
        </a>
        ; to Helen Wilson and all the staff at Westfields Sports High School; and, of course, to the dedicated parents who contribute so much through the P&amp;C and other fundraising activities.
