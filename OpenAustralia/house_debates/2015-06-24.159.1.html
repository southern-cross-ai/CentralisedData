        Five years ago this very day a person who described herself as 'an insignificant girl from Guyra' gave her valedictory speech in the House of Representatives. Recently that same person, Kay Elizabeth Hull, was deservedly recognised by being made a

        honours. Far from being insignificant, Kay has devoted herself to public service—a lifetime of helping others. Her fearless and passionate advocacy has continued since she retired as the member for Riverina in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        In her final speech to parliament, Kay used the well-known saying 'it is not the size of the dog in the fight; it is the size of the fight in the dog'. Never were truer words said. Barely five feet tall, Kay is a pocket-sized dynamo. The many highlights of her political career including helping not only to keep Wagga Wagga's Air Force base at

       <p>
        Presently Kay—the first female to do so—is chairing the

       </p>
       <p>
        This evil drug is particularly prevalent in regional areas. Kay was never afraid to speak her mind and to stand up for her beliefs, even if it meant going against the tide. She crossed the floor against the sale of Telstra in 2005. She was just as determined and vocal about the abolition of the single wheat desk in 2008. Her advocacy on behalf of people living with

        has been important. Her personal journey to help and adopt and Ethiopian family torn apart by tragedy is truly heart-warming and inspiring. As her former adviser and long-time friend, Joe Dennis once wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This unbelievable commitment, relentless pursuit of justice, determination and values of the highest community standard have inexplicably changed the life of this extended African family forever, inspiring countless others to what can be achieved when the human spirit determinedly overcomes the unachievable.

        , wetlands and Narrandera shire improvement. And lastly, but certainly by no means least, I would like to mention Rick Firman, mayor of Temora, awarded an OAM for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Temora and the wider Riverina community. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We do what we do because we love it.
       </p>
       <p>
        He is only 40. We still have a lot more to come from Rick Firman. He is a champion and I applaud all three medal winners.
