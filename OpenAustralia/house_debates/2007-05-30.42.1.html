        My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on recent initiatives to address terrorism in South-East Asia? What are the implications for Australia’s national security?

         I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The government continues to take very seriously the threat of terrorism—which is a threat to Australians abroad, in particular, but also a threat to Australia’s interests. This is a global struggle which requires global cooperation with the major countries of the region and beyond. We have no illusions about it being a long-term struggle and a very difficult struggle. In South-East Asia, the Indonesians, the Filipinos, the Malaysians and the Singaporeans have had considerable success and they have been substantially assisted by Australia. I congratulate those countries. They have also been substantially assisted by the United States of America. When I was in America last week and early this week I continued dialogue with the Americans, in particular with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State" rel="nofollow">
          Secretary of State
         </a>
         , but also in Honolulu with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Command" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Command
         </a>
         there, on the issue of counterterrorism and continued to urge active United States involvement in South-East Asia in addressing the issue of terrorism, which they have been doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have always made the point that countering terrorism requires strong international cooperation. It also requires using a variety of different tools. Clearly, in certain circumstances military action is, unfortunately, necessary. Certainly in many circumstances, police and intelligence action is necessary. We also believe it is necessary to engage the hearts and minds of people, especially in countries which are vulnerable to raising terrorists and where communities support terrorist activity.

         Yesterday I hosted the Regional Interfaith Dialogue, which involved 14 countries, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         countries, Australia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand

         , Fiji,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         . At this meeting we brought together the religious leaders—the ‘faith leaders’, as they are nowadays described—of countries right around the region. These people are able to go back to their homes and explain the message of moderation, explain the message of tolerance and explain the great virtue of resolving differences, including religious differences, through discussion and dialogue, not through resorting to militant action. The Regional Interfaith Dialogue has over the years proved to be a very effective tool to counter terrorism in South-East Asia. I should not overclaim here, but it has definitely made a contribution to reducing support in South-East Asia for extremism. The interfaith dialogue was established by the Indonesian Foreign Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Wirajuda" rel="nofollow">
          Hassan Wirajuda
         </a>
         , and me back in 2004. The first meeting was in Yogyakarta.
        </p>
        <p>
         The point I make is this: a government of this country which is effective in pursuing a counterterrorism strategy is able to do a number of things at once through its relations with countries in the region. It is able to build, for example, an interfaith dialogue. It is able to build, if you like, ‘soft power’ to address these issues throughout the region. Secondly, a government with good relations around the region and with the United States is able to harness resources into South-East Asia which otherwise would not be available. That is why I think it is disappointing that the Labor Party wants to downgrade the relationship with the United States—

            when the United States is so important to counter terrorism throughout the region. I can only say that I was delighted to spend a few days last week with Secretary Rice and some time in Honolulu discussing many issues, including the issue of counterterrorism. Opposition members damn themselves by their interjections, which simply prove the point that they do not think those sorts of personal relationships are an important part of diplomacy. Well, they would not be, if you wanted to downgrade your relations with friends like the United States.
