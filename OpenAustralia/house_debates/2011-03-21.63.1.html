        , just down here at Forrest, he worked tirelessly to offer care and friendship to patients of all beliefs and backgrounds, particularly those without family support. He offered a smile, a chat, a story and a bit of happiness and company to countless patients over the years.

        In 2002 Charles was awarded the Order of Australia medal for services to the community, particularly through the provision of pastoral care services at the Canberra Hospital. Charles was a proud Canberra Hospital Auxiliary member. He was also keen to learn more about medical issues and was made an honorary member of the Infectious Diseases Unit and the only life member of the
