        On Sunday I attended the annual Festa di
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Giuseppe" rel="nofollow">
         San Giuseppe
        </a>
        , otherwise referred to as the Feast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph
        </a>
        , in Salisbury. It is one of around 30 Italian religious and cultural festivals held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        each year, all of which honour the patron saint of one of the many different regions from where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Italian Australians
        </a>
        originate. For the past year, because of COVID-19, most of the festivals have been cancelled, so there was an added sense of excitement to the celebration of religion and Italian food, music and culture because it was a resumption. This year was also a special celebration because it marked the 150th anniversary of St Joseph being declared the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_Saint" rel="nofollow">
         Patron Saint
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Universal Church
        </a>
        . The religious service was led by Catholic Archbishop Patrick O'Regan and Father Francis Trinh Van Phat. In his sermon, Archbishop O'Regan spoke of St Joseph being a comforter, a protector and a defender, qualities which are so greatly needed in today's world. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's
        </a>
        feasts began 49 years ago, and, understandably, many of the founders have passed. However, the tradition and celebrations have continued, with younger people taking on the responsibility for organising the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with all the festivals, the St Joseph's feast is organised and run by volunteers, who make an extraordinary commitment to the event. I acknowledge President Rocco Carpentieri; his predecessor for many years and current vice president, Sam Garreffa; the committee members; and the dozens of volunteers, who together, even with the additional COVID compliance conditions, ensured a well-organised festival. I particularly acknowledge the tireless work of committee member Sister Elda Sbarra, who last year clocked up 60 years as a Canossian Sister and who, for years, has been a driving force for the St Joseph's feast. I also thank Adelaide's two Italian-language radio stations,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        Radio Italia Uno and AM Radio Italiana 531, for their live broadcast of the day's proceedings, which allowed elderly people and others confined to home to listen to the church service and the live entertainment. This year I couldn't stay for the afternoon and evening celebrations as I was returning to Canberra, but, after all the COVID restrictions and with Sunday's good weather in Adelaide, I know that people were looking forward to coming out for an enjoyable day of entertainment in the company of friends and acquaintances whom the COVID restrictions had kept them apart from. It was exactly what so many people needed to lift their spirits after so much disruption and hardship over the past year, and I compliment everyone who in any way contributed to the St Joseph's festivities.
