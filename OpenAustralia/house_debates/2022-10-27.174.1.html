        Last Friday I attended a civic event in my electorate where the keys to the city of Ipswich were presented to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich State High School
        </a>
        to acknowledge the school's historic triple title in rugby league. The school's undefeated side took out the Allan Langer Trophy, the Phil Hall Cup and the national
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        Schoolboy Cup this year and is the best school boys rugby league team in the country. Ipswich is very proud of coach, Josh Bretherton; the coaching staff; captain, Josiah Pahulu and their whole school. We are delighted for their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ipswich is a sports-mad city and the demand for sporting infrastructure is very near and dear to my heart. This is why I was pleased to secure tens of millions of dollars in the budget handed down just a couple of days ago. I'm excited to lock in a $20 million federal commitment to upgrade the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ipswich" rel="nofollow">
         North Ipswich
        </a>
        precinct as the first stage in developing a boutique 12,500 seat stadium to allow the venue to host NRL and A-league matches in the future. It sets up the city for a future with big licences in those areas. I call on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        to honour its previous $10 million promise for the upgrade. I also call on the state government to kick in money for that project.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's budget funding for other sporting facilities in Ipswich as well with $2 million to extend the Ipswich basketball stadium, to add an extra court and more parking and administrative facilities; $1 million to upgrade facilities at Ironbark Park to support the Ripley Valley football club, a club that is achieving so much in terms of the participation of girls and women; and $500,000 to finally upgrade the Ipswich hockey fields.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not all about sport. I'm thrilled to seek crucial funds in the budget for local community infrastructure. For example, there's $20,000 for a new toy library for multicultural communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redbank_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Redbank Plains
        </a>
        as well. It's home to a growing Pasifika and African population. There's $3.5 million for a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_House" rel="nofollow">
         India House
        </a>
        cultural centre in the eastern suburbs of Ipswich, a centre for the Indian community and all of South-East Queensland. This will provide a dedicated hub for community events, programs and services, and a meeting place for various local Indian business communities and associations. The booming Ipswich and Springfield region has a large and growing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian" rel="nofollow">

        population and this investment recognises the value and the needs of this vibrant community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm going to take this opportunity to say happy Diwali to everyone who is celebrating the
