        , and I presented a 2008 Australian government community award and plaque—a beautiful plaque—to Mrs Judy Wild, who was nominated by the Melaleuca Home for the Aged in

        </a>
        in my beautiful electorate of Braddon. Judy Wild has been a volunteer with many community based organisations for more than 30 years and has always displayed genuine compassion. Her concern for her fellow citizens is unparalleled, and she gives freely of her time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy’s commitment to Melaleuca Home for the Aged has been immense. Judy is an active member of Melaleuca’s auxiliary and is the current president. She was one of the original steering committee members when it was first formed, more than 25 years ago. The committee works tirelessly to fundraise to provide many items of furniture and equipment for Melaleuca, which has benefited all the residents. The auxiliary fundraising efforts have seen phenomenal results, and without their efforts Melaleuca would struggle to provide the high quality of care that residents deserve. Judy has received life membership of the auxiliary for her dedication and involvement for the past 30 years. She is also the coordinator and major force behind Melaleuca’s biennial art exhibition and formal dinner. The event is the auxiliary’s major fundraiser every second year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with other auxiliary members, Judy gives of her time freely. She has provided weekly bingo sessions to the residents of Melaleuca for the past 10 years. She readily makes herself available for resident activities that require an extra pair of hands and is always open and sincere in giving her time. Over the past 25 years Judy has visited many residents as an act of kindness and, although not related to them, she will spend many hours talking or just being there. Judy was appointed to the Melaleuca board of management in 1995 and has served tirelessly on the board, which meets a minimum of 12 times a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy has also been involved in many other activities. For instance, with Meals on Wheels she has for more than 20 years enjoyed many hours with older persons, delivering meals around the beautiful city of Devonport. Judy has devoted 1½ days per week for many years volunteering at St Vincent de Paul in East Devonport, where she assists with the never-ending tasks of sorting, cleaning and preparing clothes for resale at the thrift shop. She has been a member for many years of the City of Devonport Lions Ladies. She was a founding member of the Devonport Girl Guides Association and was involved in the creation of the hall at Devonport 30 years ago. She has been an active member of the

         AFS
        </a>
        students abroad association for many years as well. I congratulate Judy on her sterling efforts and her wonderful work. She is a great person and a deserving recipient of the 2008 Australian government community award in my electorate.
