        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Minister, when did you first become aware of the problems regarding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        salaries? How was that issue brought to your attention?

         I thank the member for Paterson for his question. One of the great privileges enjoyed by any Minister for Defence is the opportunity to move amongst, to speak with and to mix with the men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         . I can tell the House that I exercise that privilege on a regular basis. One group I regularly move amongst is those who serve in our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
          SAS
         </a>
         —those who regularly put their lives on the line for our country. I see them at their bases; and, by the way, I visited
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Campbell Barracks
         </a>
         just five days after this issue was first revealed last year to check on members of the regiment and to secure feedback from them. I also see them on exercises. I eat with them. I even have a beer with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         No-one knows them better than I and no-one has a higher appreciation of what they do for their country. As minister, I will not allow them to be disadvantaged. When I first learned of the implications of the tribunal’s decision in October last year during Senate estimates I took immediate action. I directed the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army to put an immediate stop on any recovery action—a recovery action which was immediately implemented and has remained in place up until this day. I also instructed them to immediately do whatever it takes to correct this problem. I said earlier in the week that that solution came much more slowly than I would have liked. What we did need, of course, was a solution that was legally robust—one which was permanent and did not, in its rush, simply create more problems for those affected.

          <p>
           This question was thoroughly examined during Senate estimates this morning, and I welcome that examination. I am pleased that senior people in uniform, including the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army, were able to give what I thought were very adequate answers and a fuller explanation—they had more time than I have here to explain the situation. Additionally I am pleased that Senator Johnston—to his credit I should say—has now acknowledged that the situation is being progressed in a positive way. I will quote Senator Johnston from Senate estimates when he said: ‘Now, can I thank you, General’—that is Lieutenant General Gillespie—‘for the way you’ve answered my questions today. I am satisfied that things are moving ahead positively. I have what I need for my satisfaction that these men will be looked after properly.’ I guaranteed those affected that they would not be financially disadvantaged. They will not be. They are not. The problem has been solved.
