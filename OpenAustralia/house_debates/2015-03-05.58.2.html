        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today the parliament meets in the shadow of the possible execution of two young Australian men. This is an unimaginably difficult time for these two men and their families. Can the Prime Minister update the House on Australia's efforts to seek clemency for

         I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his important and serious question. I thank him for the conversations that we have been able to have on this subject and for the substantial unanimity that we have achieved on this subject. I think it is to Australia's credit that government and opposition are able to speak with one voice on a matter such as this, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to add to my own thoughts at the conclusion of this answer. We do stand together on this. We are all, when it comes to this, Australians first and members of different political parties second.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Australians, we abhor drug crime—we stand resolutely against drug crime—but we are against the death penalty as well, particularly for people who have been on death row for more than a decade and who are obviously substantially rehabilitated. This question of these impending executions touches our values. We are a decent and humane people who stand up for good wherever we can, and we certainly stand up for our citizens wherever we can. It also touches our interests. Our interests are involved here. We want the best possible relationship with Indonesia and our relationship with Indonesia must continue regardless of anything that might happen in the next few days. But we want the best possible relationship with the best possible Indonesia. And how can it be in Indonesia's interest to kill these two men, who are now helping Indonesia in the fight against drug crime? How can it possibly be in Indonesia's interest to kill these men, who are a credit to the Indonesian penal system's capacity to rehabilitate; its capacity to uplift and even inspire?
        </p>
        <p>
         I want the best for Indonesia. I regard myself as a friend of Indonesia. I have travelled to Indonesia privately and publicly. Indonesia is a country on the cusp of greatness. But how can it possibly help Indonesia to go ahead with these executions? How can it possibly help Indonesia to go ahead with the executions of the some 60 foreigners now on death row for drug crime in Indonesia? How can it possibly help them? So, as someone who wants nothing but good thing for Indonesia—as a government and as a parliament that want nothing but good for Indonesia—we are speaking as one united voice, publicly and privately, in every way we can. Pull back from this brink. Do not just realise what is in your own best interests but realise what is in your own best values.

          on indulgence—I support what the Prime Minister has said. Labor's thoughts, like all of Australia's, are with these two young men and their families. It is unimaginable what they are experiencing. I do not believe that Australia is seeking forgiveness for these two men or, indeed, to free them, but by all accounts they have changed. They have repented of what they have done, they have understood the mistakes they have made and they are making remarkable contributions in terms of what they do now.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some people have said to me, 'But it's drugs. People know the law of the land they travel into and, really, that's all that you can expect in this matter.' What I would say—and this parliament, I genuinely believe, supports this—is: the death penalty will solve nothing. The execution of these two young men will solve nothing. There are legal processes underway. We would seek that they be allowed to continue and be resolved.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also endorse what the Prime Minister said: the entire parliament is united on this matter. We are united in seeking that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
           President of Indonesia
          </a>
          , presenting the great and strong and generous nature of the Indonesian people, would grant clemency to these two men, just as the Indonesian government seeks clemency for its citizens when facing execution elsewhere.
