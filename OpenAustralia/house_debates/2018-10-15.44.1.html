        It has been a hive of activity in Canning these past three weeks. We've had the Serpentine and Jarrahdale Country Fair and Jarrahdale Log Chop; the Waroona Show and the Perth Hills Live Lighter Festival. Every year the volunteers who organise these events do a wonderful job of showcasing our region and building up our local community. Special congratulations must be made to the Waroona Agricultural Society, which hosted its 88th show, and also to the Hills Orchardist Improvement Group, which had its 35th show just this past Saturday.

        We have also had the health minister visit Canning. He visited the Peel Maternity and

        run by Dr Peter Kell. Dr Kell and his team have created a unique model of maternity care that brings together midwives,

        s, obstetricians and healthcare professionals who care for families through all stages of pregnancy and beyond. It was a pleasure to show the minister how the model works and why it has been so successful in delivering over 10,000 babies since the practice was established in 2006.

        And last Thursday the Peel Employment Facilitator, Maryann Baker, and the Department of Jobs held the Peel Region Jobs Fair in Mandurah. This fair connected jobseekers with recruitment agencies, potential employers and researchers. It was heartening to see more than 750 people attend the event, including people in the middle-age bracket, to participate in workshops and to hear about what they can do to increase their job prospects. We all know that work gives people dignity and purpose, and the Peel jobs fairâ€”
