       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to show parliament a petition from the Save Our Seton action group, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS" rel="nofollow">
         SOS
        </a>
        . Last week I spoke in the House about the impending closure of Seton College, which provides support to students with learning difficulties and special needs. Current student Tayhlia Shaw set up this petition after hearing the devastating news, and it has now gained more than 5,500 signatures, with more community support growing every day. The Save our Seton community is hoping that this petition will put pressure on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Catholic_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Catholic Education
        </a>
        to rethink their decision to close this school, which has provided hope, acceptance and happiness for so many young students who had struggled in mainstream schooling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tayhlia said her time at Seton College is the best she could have imagined, and, through her experience, she believes students are better supported with individualised learning. She said that, as a Seton student, she has learned resilience and understanding of her emotions. She's learned how to make friends and how to treat others with respect. Because of the school's good morals and extra support for students with special needs, she is desperate to see the school stay open so that future students may be given the opportunities that she has had to have the best outcomes from their education.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition is proof that the decision to close Seton College is unwelcomed by the community and unwarranted. I seek leave to present this document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
