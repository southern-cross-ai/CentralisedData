       <p>
        Our roads need to be safe; it's just that simple. The first responsibility of government at any level is to protect the safety of people, but Tivoli Drive in Curlewis in my electorate of Corangamite is not safe. It's an accident waiting to happen, it's an accident the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        says it cannot fix for another five years and it's an accident that could and should have been avoided if only the council had planned this road better.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was only built a few years ago, and, instead of supporting local traffic only, it is now a significant link road for trucks and construction. The road is too narrow. When cars are parked, there's no way two cars can pass at the same time. Speed humps have slowed the traffic, but they have also caused significant noise pollution, with the screeching of truck brakes causing unrest and frustration for nearby residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fixing mistakes isn't easy, but the council needs to take responsibility. It must fully fund the widening of this road in the upcoming budget. As an interim measure, the community would welcome a local-traffic-only restriction. Last year the mayor of Geelong said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The extension of Tivoli Drive improves access and safety for both motorists and pedestrians.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now time to live up to this commitment and widen Tivoli Drive. It is of paramount importance if we are to keep the community of Curlewis safe.
