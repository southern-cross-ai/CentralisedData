        In early August, Australia's Professor Tom Borody did some media. We talked about him having a cure for coronavirus, based around Ivermectin. He gave interviews about it and spoke about it, yet our TGA authorities condoned Professor Borody. They didn't only criticise him; they went out of their way to say he was wrong and asked for doctors to report anyone that was 'inappropriately administering' Ivermectin to their patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only last week we saw a paper which shows how correct Professor Borody was. This was a study done out of Argentina which involved an Australian researcher from Adelaide. They looked at 1,195 healthcare workers from four hospitals in Argentina, where 788 received Ivermectin and Carrageenan and the other 470 didn't take it. Of the 470 that didn't take Ivermectin or Carrageenan, there was a 58.2 per cent infection rate. Of those 470, 237 became infected with coronavirus. Of the 788 that took Professor Borody's recommended treatment, there was not one single infectionâ€”58 per cent versus zero. Professor Tom Borody, an Australian genius, was correct, and medical authorities need to review the evidence and recommend Ivermectin as a treatment for coronavirus.
