       <p>
        I wish to bring the attention of the House to an ongoing issue of critical significance within the electorate of Canning. Denny Avenue and the poorly designed intersections with Streich Avenue and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Albany Highway
        </a>
        , combined with its strategic location in the centre of the Kelmscott Town Centre and recent development in the area, has turned this site into a notorious danger spot for motorists in the north of my electorate. It continues to endanger the lives of motorists and pedestrians alike, to the point where I receive daily feedback from concerned constituents about how dangerous it is to travel through this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I last spoke on this matter on 2 March, the day after a father of three was tragically killed in a three-way collision at the intersection of Denny Avenue and Albany Highway. At the time, I called upon the Western Australian Minister for Transport, the Hon. Dean Nalder
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        , to collaborate with me in finding a solution to, once and for all, put an end to this unacceptable risk that motorists are faced with when travelling along this 200-metre stretch of road.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, two more significant collisions have occurred. On 14 and 28 May they happened, causing injury to those involved, lane closures and traffic building up across the arterial roads and nearby. I have received bipartisan support on this from Tony Buti MLA, the member for Armadale, but it is extremely disappointing that Minister Nalder refuses to meet with us on this issue. I ask Minister Nalder, the Department of Transport and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Roads_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , again: how many people must be injured and killed before this matter is taken seriously?
