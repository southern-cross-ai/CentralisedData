        Small and medium businesses are the lifeblood of the Australian economy, as we all know. That is no different in the magnificent electorate of Braddon. On Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the Central Coast Chamber of Commerce and Industry Awards evening, a great night recognising industry leaders. In congratulating the award winners here today, I would like to make special mention of Henry's Ginger Beer. Members probably had a taste of that last Wednesday night. They were judged as the most successful start-up business in the area. Well done, Henry's Ginger Beer.

        Joining them were the winners of: the outstanding tourism experience award, Pier 01; the excellence in manufacturing award and the innovation award,

        Civil Engineering; and the enhancing regional culture award, Tastrofest. Gena Cantwell from Wings Wildlife Park, which is a regular feature of local, state and national awards, won the outstanding customer service award for an individual. The outstanding customer service award for business went to the IGA railway supermarket. Ulverstone Neighbourhood House took out the community service award. The agribusiness award went to Botanical Resources and, finally, Degree C won the business of the year award. Degree C, along with other winners, all deserve the recognition these awards bring. In my role, I have met with most of these businesses. I congratulate the owners, the management and their dedicated employees for the way in which they operate as small and medium businesses in the electorate.
