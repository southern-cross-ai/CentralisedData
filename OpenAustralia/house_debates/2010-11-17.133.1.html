        I would like to draw the Committee’s attention to the recent boost of $1.3 million in funding for Home and Community Care services in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . The additional funding will bring the federal government’s contribution to the ACT
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HACC" rel="nofollow">
         HACC
        </a>
        program to $15.2 million, which represents an increase of 7.9 per cent on the 2009-10 funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The HACC program provides a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated range of maintenance and support services to help the frail, the aged, and young people with a disability, and their carers, to continue to live independently in the community. The HACC funding will support a range of services including Meals on Wheels, home care, respite and social programs and community transport. Most importantly, it will help 11,000 vulnerable members of the ACT community.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my campaign I visited the Marymead Child and Family Centre in Narrabundah to learn about the services this well-known and well-respected Canberra institution provides to the community. Marymead works with single parent families; the unemployed; families struggling with substance abuse, significant breakdown, conflict and violence; or people whose situation is exacerbated by poor and temporary housing issues. So I was delighted to hear Marymead will receive over $26,000 in HACC funding to help it continue to enhance the wellbeing of children, young people and families in times of need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tandem Respite is a group that promotes independence and quality of life. Tandem Respite will receive over $23,000 in HACC funding to provide home based support with a support worker in the individual’s or family’s home. Tandem Respite also provides recreational based support through a support worker who takes children and young people out in the community to develop important social skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Koomarri, which is based in Phillip in my electorate, assists the disabled and their carers with employment and life skills. Koomarri will receive $144,000 to enhance independent living skills such as cooking, nutrition, health, fitness and computing. Communities@Work, which provides an enormous array of services throughout Canberra and is based in Tuggeranong near my electorate office, will receive $67,000 to buy a new 12-seater bus with wheelchair lifter to transport the frail, aged and disabled to social activities and health services. Other organisations in my electorate that received funding are: Community Options,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        , Community Connections, Community Connections, Just Better Care Community Services and Ngunnawal Aboriginal Corporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend these organisations for their great work in helping those most in need in the Canberra community. I also commend and thank the Gillard government, particularly the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        and Ageing, for the HACC funding.
