        I rise tonight to highlight the government's neglect of mobile communications in regional Australia. As I talk to people in regional Australia about communications problems that matter to them, the most common complaint is poor mobile phone coverage. This anecdotal evidence has been backed up by the 2011-12 regional telecommunications review, which was released by the government last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of mobile communications was raised in about two-thirds of the submissions received by the review and in every public consultation session. Good mobile phone coverage in regional communities is vital to maintain social connections, improve safety, and attract and retain workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June 2011 there were 29.28 million mobile voice or data services in Australia, which is up 13 per cent from the previous year. A significant part of this growth in demand is from people who want access to mobile broadband services. Mobile communications are now the norm. Without a reliable mobile phone service you are in danger of being left behind.
       </p>
       <p>
        The review found that people without reliable mobile coverage are finding it increasingly difficult to fully participate in the digital economy. Unreliable mobile coverage means: 'Businesses are unable to capitalise on advances in technology to improve productivity—for example, agricultural applications that use mobile technology to record and process data in the field.' It is very clear that poor mobile phone coverage is having a significant impact on some regional communities.

        . In a submission to the Regional Telecommunications Review, they said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We recently installed telemetry units at stock watering points to try and be more efficient with our labour costs and fuel usage. These units rely on having mobile service and so unfortunately are unreliable, as is the coverage. We were very disheartened at this as there is such terrific new technology available but we still do not have the basics to be able to advance any further.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not an isolated problem. Nor is it a new problem. Of the 222 submissions received by the Regional Telecommunications Review almost 150 raised concerns about poor mobile phone coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mobile phone coverage and reliability was the predominant issue raised during the Glasson review into regional telecommunications in 2008. Given the importance of this issue, I question why the government is not taking this issue seriously. In fact, despite improved mobile phone coverage being a key recommendation of the Glasson review in 2008, the government has completely neglected this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Page 132 of the Glasson review states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Around $145 million has been spent since 2001 on terrestrial mobile phone infrastructure, resulting in new or improved coverage to 560 towns and districts, 62 lengths along 34 regional highways, and near-continuous coverage along 10,000 kilometres of 16 national highways.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are impressive figures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us look at developments since then. This is a direct quote from page 41 of the 2011-12 Regional Telecommunications Review:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2001, the Australian government has spent around $145 million on improving terrestrial mobile phone infrastructure. This has resulted in new or improved coverage to 560 towns and districts, 62 lengths along 34 regional highways, and coverage along 10,000 kilometres of 16 national highways.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been no change since 2008. The government has done nothing to improve mobile phone coverage in regional Australia. Since the election of the Rudd government in 2007 Labor has not spent one cent on improving mobile phone coverage to regional areas. Meanwhile, we have people like Jim Barwick, who lives near Warialda in New South Wales, crying out for something to be done: He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … for crying out loud, surely we have a right to be able to make … mobile phone call without having to climb a tree or sit on a silo!
       </p>
       <p>
        I am under no illusion about the costs of increasing mobile coverage. It is not cheap. But the benefits of improved mobile phone coverage should not be underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boorowa Shire Council's submission to the Regional Telecommunications Review is particularly clear about the economic benefits of improved mobile coverage:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Business in general has become more cost efficient through the use of technology, there is a definite productivity contrast between those farmers who enjoy mobile coverage and those that don't. This impacts not only on profitability and competition but will also have a negative impact on land values.
       </p>
       <p>
        Poor mobile phone coverage is also a hindrance for rural businesses trying to attract and retain qualified staff. Victorian grazier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Croft" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst some may find the idea of travelling into the outback and being able to get away from the phone quite romantic, for us trying to run a business and trying to attract young, energetic and technology savvy staff, this problem is a source of much frustration and concern and needs to be addressed as a matter of some priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without improved mobile phone networks, it will become very difficult to find young people willing to work in industries like shearing, earthmoving and transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, poor mobile coverage is also an additional safety risk for people living and working in regional and remote Australia. A submission from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         West Australian
        </a>
        farmer Jason Syred provides a perfect example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My wife called me to say that she had hit a kangaroo before the phone service dropped out which left me wondering whether to go looking for her or not and where to head. Directing people to a fire we had burning out of control on our property was a nightmare with everyone's mobile phones being unreliable.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will never have mobile phone coverage over 100 per cent of Australia. But this issue is too important for the government's 'head in the sand' approach to continue. There are clear examples around Australia where improvements should be made.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeton_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Copeton Dam
        </a>
        , near Inverell in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        , is a perfect example of where the government could make a significant difference with a relatively modest investment. Copeton Dam is very popular with waterskiers, fishermen and campers. About 100,000 people visit the dam every year. Unfortunately, there is no mobile phone coverage in the area. Introducing mobile coverage around Copeton Dam would make the dam a safer place for families to enjoy and would make it possible for more people to visit. Many tourists cannot holiday in areas without mobile phone coverage because they need to remain in touch with their business or workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another specific problem raised with me recently is the challenge of providing mobile coverage in areas with a large seasonal workforce. As I speak, the cotton harvest is in full swing in south-western Queensland. Hundreds of workers come into the area for the harvest, bringing with them hundreds of mobile phones. The local network simply cannot cope with the increase in load. Many workers also find that they have no reception on the farms where they are temporarily working and living.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a role for the government in improving the mobile phone network. As I mentioned earlier, the coalition has a strong track record in this area. We implemented the $15.65 million extended mobile phone coverage in regional Australia program, which improved
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA" rel="nofollow">
         CDMA
        </a>
        coverage in 62 locations. The coalition also funded the Towns Over 500 program, which improved mobile coverage for 131 towns in regional Australia with populations of more than 500 people. The coalition funded the $25 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Phones" rel="nofollow">
         Mobile Phones
        </a>
        on Highways program to improve coverage along major Australian highways. We also funded the $19 million Mobile Phones on Regional Highways initiative. We implemented a significant number of small projects worth more than $10 million through the Networking the Nation initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor government failed to make any improvements to mobile phone coverage in Australia after the Glasson review. This must not happen again. The government has six months to respond to the Regional Telecommunications Review. This time, regional Australia needs action from this government. The government is spending billions on the

         HFC

        cable. We do not need billions to improve the mobile phone network. What is needed is targeted, modest investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have already outlined the reasons why this investment is necessary. In fact, many of the arguments in favour of government investment in the mobile phone network are the same arguments the government uses to support the NBN. If more motivation is needed, the Regional Telecommunications Review makes a clear recommendation to the government to invest in the mobile phone network. This is basic stuff for any government that understands the needs of regional Australia. Five years of inaction is not good enough. I am calling on the government to accept the recommendations of the regional telecommunications review and start investing in Australia's mobile phone network.
