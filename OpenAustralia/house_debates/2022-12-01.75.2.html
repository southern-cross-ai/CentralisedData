        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. I refer to the government report, based on October data, titled 'Estimated impacts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFP" rel="nofollow">
         CFP
        </a>
        s'—which are coal-fired power stations—'and associated coalmine closures'. Do you acknowledge that the report has been compiled, and will you release it?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all ministers would expect a question on something that was on the front page of a newspaper—so no surprises there. Congratulations for getting to it when it was on the front page of yesterday's newspaper! Congratulations for that!
        </p>
        <p>
         That's actually the least of the problems with the question. The document the honourable member refers to does refer to the closure of Liddell power station and Bayswater power station. Liddell's closure was announced in 2015, and Bayswater's closure was announced in February this year. A common fact about those closures is that we weren't in office at the time. A common fact about that is that those opposite were in charge at the time those were announced.

               To be fair to the honourable member who asked the question, he had a plan for Liddell. He planned to nationalise the Liddell power station, if only he was in a job where he could have done something about that—if only he had a role in the government where he could have made a decision! The former Minister for Energy had a plan for Bayswater when the closure was announced. He issued a press release saying the Morrison government expects the market to step up. That was his big plan: the market to step up to deal with the closure of Bayswater. That's all he had. I guess that was better than the closure of the Eraring power station, where the minister didn't even know it was being closed until he read it in the newspaper. That was the level of trust between the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               energy minister and the federal energy minister. The New South Wales energy minister—a Liberal minister—was involved in the planning of the closure. He didn't trust the federal minister enough to tell him.
              </p>
              <p>
               We know that the regions are going through economic change, none more so than the Hunter. That's why we have plans. Those opposite don't get it. We saw the coalminer-cosplay senator, Senator Canavan, in the Hunter the other week. He tweeted:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Just passing by the Liddell coal fired power station and want to say THANKS to all the workers who make modern life possible!
              </p>
              <p>
               It was Bayswater power station! That's how much they understand.
              </p>
              <p>
               I tell you who does know the Hunter: the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson, the member for Shortland and the member for Newcastle, because they're delivering upgrades for the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Airport" rel="nofollow">
                Newcastle Airport

               , they're delivering the Muswellbrook Bypass, and they're delivering the Muswellbrook town centre upgrade. The member for Paterson and I are delivering for
