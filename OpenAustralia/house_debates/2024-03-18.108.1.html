         I thank the member for the question. He is very familiar with the issues of jobs, economic development and housing in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, I visited
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         , Darwin, Katherine and the small community of Binjari. People are so excited about the new Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program and the possibilities it brings. It will create 3,000 real jobs in remote communities with proper wages and proper conditions. It will build the remote workforce and boost regional economies.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the Kalano Community Association just outside Katherine I saw for myself innovation in action. I met two young men who had joined the remote jobs trial that makes swags, a Territory essential apparently. The long-term plan is to develop a local swag-making business. It is an idea that's come from the community and is being led by the community. I also spoke to women from nearby rockhole who are working in the Deadly Cooking, making healthy, nutritious meals using an electric fry pan, a very sensible idea in remote Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         At Binjari I joined the Prime Minister to announce a historic investment to improve housing in remote Northern Territory. The joint funding with the Northern Territory government will see up to 270 new homes built each year for 10 years. Importantly, it will also fund repairs and maintenance. Reducing overcrowding means better health, keeping children and families safe and allowing children to focus properly on school. In Binjari, we met Stevie, Stuart and Stephanie, who had just moved into their new home, which has good design, environmental sustainability and disability access. They are so happy.

         Decent housing and more opportunities to work are fundamental to closing the gap. They bring pride and they also bring local employment. As Skye Thompson, the
