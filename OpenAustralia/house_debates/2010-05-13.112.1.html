        This week being National Volunteer Week, I think it is important to acknowledge the efforts of more than five million Australians who volunteer and who are an essential part of our society—five million selfless Australians who help others in need across every sector of the community and every corner of the nation. I would also like to mention a particular group in my electorate that makes a significant contribution to the social fabric of the community through their volunteering. Last week I had the honour of the visiting the Narre Warren
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , led by Tim Howell, to meet four of the dedicated volunteers there. The unit has only been in existence for five years but has already made a massive contribution to the local community. The volunteers are not that different from many Australians—they come from all walks of life; they are retirees, nurses, graphic designers, tradesmen, mothers and fathers—but their contributions and personal sacrifices are extraordinary and for that they are extraordinary people and understated heroes, a very quintessential Australian trait.

        As an example, in late August last year Melbourne was hit with one of its most savage storms in recent memory. Some areas of the city reported winds of up to 128 kilometres per hour. Blackouts and hail were widespread and falling trees caused significant damage. When events like this occur across the country, when trees fall across roads and on people’s homes, when storms damage roofs, when floodwaters overwhelm suburbs and streets, in the heartbreak of attempting to locate a missing loved one—someone’s mother or father, daughter or son—there is a special group of people to whom the community turns for help. This is the work that the dedicated volunteers that I just mentioned do. Volunteer services like the SES comprise thousands of Australian’s across every state who volunteer their time to help. They do not do this to be recognised in this place and they do not do it for money. Giving the

        </a>
        and its many volunteers some public recognition for their selfless efforts is in my view a small but important gesture we can make as members of parliament. It is particularly pertinent given that this week is National Volunteer Week.

        During the storm I mentioned, the Narre Warren SES received over 260 calls in a 12-hour period, making them one of the busiest units in Victoria. That was only one incident. The unit’s commander, Tim Howell, and his 27 members work tirelessly to ensure this support can be provided 24 hours a day every single day of the year. It is worth remembering that, in order to perform this support, dedicated members are required to take time away from families, friends and jobs. It is also important to remember and pay tribute to the partners, children and other family members who tolerate and respect their lives being interrupted by the sound of SES issued pagers breaking the silence to notify members of someone in need. At this point in time I would also like to pay tribute to the many small businesses that give their staff the time to volunteer to undertake this great work. In this week acknowledging volunteers, I would like to make special mention of the Narre Warren SES and pay tribute on behalf of this place to the work that they do to keep our community safe.
