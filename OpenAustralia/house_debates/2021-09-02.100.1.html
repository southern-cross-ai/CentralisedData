        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said, 'Ultimately, everything is a state matter.' Was it the states or was it the Prime Minister who falsely claimed that Australia was at the forefront of the vaccine queue?

         Again the Labor Party in their questions misrepresent things. They simply misrepresent things. This is something I've become very familiar with over the course of the last 18 months. The government have focused strongly on delivering our national plan, and that includes the fact that 20 million doses of that vaccine have been administered in this country. Even just this week 500,000 additional doses have been secured from Singapore. That's on top of the more than a million doses that we were able to secure in an arrangement with Poland. And I can assure you there are more irons in the fire here, Mr Speaker, which means we will be able to continue to support the vaccination rates that we're seeing, which support the national planâ€”the national plan that enables our country to live with this virus, not live in fear of it, to live without lockdowns and not in fear of lockdowns, so businesses can plan with confidence, so Australians can come together again and connect with the rest of the world, so Australians can travel again, so there are the workers we need to reap the harvest and work in the mines and wherever they are across this country. That's what the national plan delivers. That's what our government has been focused on. By contrast, we get the negativity and the undermining of an opposition that only knows that way and provides no hope and no plan. By contrast, the Australian people can have confidence that our national plan will see them go forward, our economy move forward, to defy the negativity and the undermining of those who would seek for Australia to fail. Under our government, our country will succeed. We're inspired by those Paralympians as well who show us the way. They show us the way of optimism and hope. The hope-stealers of those opposite will be dismissed, and the Australian people will continue to support the optimistic and positive plan that our government has put in place.
