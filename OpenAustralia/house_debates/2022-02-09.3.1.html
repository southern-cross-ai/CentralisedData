       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        (c) the inequity in education, skills and training opportunities has been exacerbated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Government's decisions to, amongst other things, increase the cost of higher education, refuse to fund free access to public TAFE and neglect of the needs of the school system;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) in contrast, Labor has a range of commitments to make education and training more accessible, including to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) make child care cheaper for 97 per cent of Australian parents;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) support 10,000 New Energy Apprenticeships;

       <p class="italic">
        (iii) introduce an Australian Skills Guarantee;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) provide 465,000 free TAFE places and up to 20,000 new university places; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) invest $440 million to improve ventilation in classrooms and provide more counselling and psychological support; and

       <p class="italic">
        (e) more needs to be done to assist students who are disengaged in learning, or who do not respond to traditional school programs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that one of the standout success stories in achieving this is, Hands on Learning, a program first piloted at Frankston High School in 1999 by Russell Kerr, OAM, that builds wellbeing, engagement, and attendance by creating opportunities for students to discover their talents and experience success through significant and authentic hands-on projects, that results in 95 per cent of Hands on Learning students finishing school, getting an apprenticeship or getting a job.
