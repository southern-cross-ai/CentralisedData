        <p>
         I thank the member for Bean for this question and also for his leadership as a local member here in our national capital. We've come to office at a really, really important time for our country's national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has been clear with our citizens. Australia faces the most difficult geopolitical circumstances that we have confronted since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . About a year before our election, our national security agencies informed the Australian people that, for the first time, the biggest national security challenges that we face as a country are espionage and foreign interference. Grappling with these issues is difficult, it is complex and it is a core priority of our government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the parliament worked together to bring to a close a long-running national security concern facing our country. Russia has an embassy, in Canberra, located in Griffith. In 2008, they obtained a lease to build a second embassy here in the national capital. Our government has been advised that the construction of the embassy on that land would represent a threat to Australia's national security. The concern is one of proximity. The land is a stone's throw from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . Our government received specific national security advice that allowing this proposal to proceed on that land would not be in the national interest and, indeed, that the scope for espionage and foreign interference from the site would have been a substantial risk for the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why, today, our parliament passed a law which brings to an end the lease agreement that existed between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          National Capital Authority
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          Russian Federation
         </a>
         . The action is direct and decisive. We do not have any interest in sugar-coating this message. We will not stand for espionage and foreign interference in our country. We will act in the face of danger to our democracy and our citizens, and we will do so without any apology to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to note something for Australians about the way in which this was dealt with by the parliament. The reason we have been able to move so swiftly on this matter is the support for this decisive action from right across the parliament. There is necessarily a lot of focus on the conflict that goes on in this building; there is not as much reporting and discussion about the moments of goodwill and national unity. I want to thank the opposition, the Greens and the crossbench for the way in which they have worked with the government and the concern they have shown for the national security information that we have been providing them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We face a lot of difficulties that will come to us in the decades ahead. I think Australians know that. I hope that incidents like today give them some confidence that in moments like this, when it comes to the national security of our country, we in this parliament are all on the same side. We face challenges, but we bring to them the most important of assets, and that is the national unity you saw in dealing with this issue today in the parliament.

         <p>
          on indulgenceâ€”I want to commend the minister and the Prime Minister of the government for moving swiftly in relation to this matter. I think the point the minister makes is incredibly important to underscore. It is incredibly important for the Australian public to hear and, as I said yesterday in response to a different matter, for our friends and adversaries to hear that there is an absolutely unified position from the Australian parliament, representing the Australian people, that we won't tolerate foreign espionage conducted in a way that is against our national interest. We won't tolerate people seeking to interfere with electoral processes in our country.
         </p>
         <p>
          The work of the government was briefed to me, the Leader of the Nationals and Senator Birmingham last night. We received that advice and pledged to the Prime Minister during the course of that meeting that it was our view shared that it was in our national interest that this matter be dealt with expeditiously by the parliament. We were able to do that. Again, I think it sends a very clear message to those that would seek to act against our national interests that they find no friend in this parliament in relation to their activities. We will do whatever it takes to make sure that we ensure our sovereignty, and that will always be the case.

          <p>
           on indulgenceâ€”May I very briefly acknowledge as Prime Minister the confidence that I have that this parliament will always act. We provided confidential briefings on the national security issues to the coalition yesterday evening. They pledged immediately their support. It is that confidence that's very important for our nation and for the crossbenchers as well in both chambers. All were briefed or offered briefings, and I thank them for their support as well.
