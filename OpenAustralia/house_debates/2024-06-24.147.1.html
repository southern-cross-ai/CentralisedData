        I rise to pay tribute to Keith Barry Michael Ryder, who passed away on 4 April aged 85. Keith was born in Brisbane in February 1939 to his parents, Beryl and Keith Ryder Sr. He had a modest upbringing, sharing his childhood with his younger brother, Paul. While at high school, Keith developed skills in shorthand that laid the foundation for a future career. In 1965, Keith married Noelene, a country girl from Gympie. They settle in Brisbane, where Keith began his Queensland court reporting bureau career, honing his shorthand and reporting skills. In 1967, Keith and Noelene shifted to Canberra and he commenced work at

        </a>
        as a reporter with Commonwealth Hansard. He climbed the ladder to a managerial position, and during this time he would also work as a reporter in the Queensland,

        parliaments. He also worked in all parliamentary buildings in Australia,

        </a>
        . Upon his retirement in 1994, Keith worked at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Legislative Assembly, during which time he introduced several reforms to modernise the production of the assembly Hansard. Keith worked casually, full time and then casually again before finally retiring at age 83.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keith and Noelene were blessed with two children, Samantha and Joshua. He was never shy about expressing his love and pride for his family. Keith was a doting grandfather to Zac, Kade, Maeve and Amber. Keith and Noelene were married for 59 years at the time of his passing, and that's a testament to their enduring love and commitment to their family. Keith was a spritely 85-year-old. However, he had a few health issues. Twenty years ago, he had a triple bypass and then bowel, liver and, more recently, prostate cancerâ€”all of which he overcame. While there were many things that tried to take him out slowly, it was ultimately a stroke that sent him on his way while watching the Raiders lead the Sharks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Keith in 1989 as a newly in love, very nervous 17-year-old meeting the extended family of my now wife. Keith was a wise, very gentle man with a big heart. Keith was at my maiden speech when I made it in 2016, and that was a very special moment for me as he saw the development of my life from being that 17-year-old kid to where I am today. My condolences go to Noelene and the family. Rest in peace, Keith Barry Michael Ryder.
