        Today, 25 November, marks White Ribbon Day, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        international day for the elimination of violence against women. White Ribbon Day focuses on the positive roles that men can play to create a culture whereby violence and attitudes that support the use of violence are increasingly found unacceptable in society.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         The White Ribbon
        </a>
        campaign is calling on all Australian men to sign up and swear to end violence against women as the first step in creating a culture of change on this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The White Ribbon campaign is unique because it is aimed at prevention and focuses on encouraging men to take the lead role in their immediate communities and within their networks to eliminate violence against women. White Ribbon encourages all members of the community, particularly men, to speak out against violence and discourage all attitudes that allow violence in our society, particularly those directed against women and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is with great concern that I note the statistic that one in three women will experience physical violence and one in five will experience sexual violence over their lifetime. To put that in a personal context—and I invite all members of the House to do that—let me speak about the women that I love and care about in my family: my mother, my wife, my daughter and my two grandchildren. Over a lifetime, one of these would be subject to this form of extreme violence. As a son, a husband, a father and as a grandfather, I would find that completely reprehensible, and something that would have to be stamped out, because this is my family. When we pursue this issue it behoves all of us to think the same way. This is not just somebody else’s problem; this is actually our problem, and a scourge on our society.
       </p>

        I am happy to note that in my electorate this morning, my staff, particularly Alicia Bowie, together with representatives from the

        </a>
        , Macquarie Fields Police, the Fields Neighbourhood Centre, and Campbelltown Police were at Ingleburn Railway Station and Campbelltown Railway Station at six o’clock this morning selling white ribbons. I am advised that most of the merchandise was sold out within the first two hours. They are also going to various shopping centres, particularly the Glenquarie Shopping Centre, the Campbelltown Mall and

        later on today.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to ensure that this is not just another day that we note on the calendar, but that it is a day in which people make a change in their attitude—a change for good. Later today I will be joining the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many of my parliamentary colleagues in the Senate courtyard to swear the oath against violence against women. I encourage all members to become ambassadors for this great cause.
