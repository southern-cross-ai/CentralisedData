       </small>
       <p>
        In this consideration in detail, one of the things that the opposition and the parliament are interested in is the current nature of Australia’s deployment in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        and the circumstances which gave rise to that deployment. Obviously, having visited East Timor myself, I know the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        are doing well on the ground and are dealing with a difficult and dangerous situation which presents itself. The task for which they were sent was to ensure that civil war did not erupt between the disintegrating elements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
         East Timorese
        </a>
        defence force and the East Timorese police force. On that score, their job so far has been well executed. Of course, when it comes to the law and order function within Dili itself and beyond, that more properly is a function which should be given to the police. One of the problems that the Australian Brigadier Mick Slater has encountered on the ground is not having those police resources at his disposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The debate, though, which legitimately arises from the nature of Australia’s continuing commitment—in budgetary terms as well—to East Timor is how we have ended up in a situation where this deployment has become necessary. There are a couple of questions I would therefore appreciate the minister providing us with some enlightenment on. When it comes to the question of the wind-back of Australia’s participation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        peacekeeping force in Timor from 2003 onwards, on what basis did the government in 2003, with the consideration of UN
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Security Council
        </a>
        resolution 1473, begin a process of winding down Australia’s military commitment? Did the UN Secretary-General, in the consideration of that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         UN Security Council
        </a>
        resolution, have a different view? Was a different view put by the government of East Timor at the time when that resolution was passed by the council?

           <p>
            When it comes to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
             East Timor
            </a>
            question, I am happy for the minister to respond as these things unfold. There are a number of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN
            </a>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Security Council
            </a>
            resolutions which then followed between 2003 and 2005. When you look at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
             UN Security Council
            </a>
            resolution 1543 of May 2004 you will see that again the question is: why did the government make a decision to further reduce Australia’s military commitment to that peacekeeping force? What particular representations—and these are questions to the minister—did he or the government make through our mission in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
             New York
            </a>
            to the United
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation" rel="nofollow">
             Nation
            </a>
            s on the composition of that force, any reduction to it or any change in the scope of its operations? Did the government of East Timor at the time of Security Council resolution 1543 in May 2004 express any contrary view about the need to retain the force as it was prior to that date?
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, on the question of East Timor, we come to the most recent resolution—UN Security Council resolution 1599 of April 2005. This is of course where we see the radical wind-back of the remaining elements of the military commitment to East Timor and a number of statements were made at that time about whether or not that was a wise course of action. One thing which has struck us, and which I would appreciate the minister’s response on, is: given that those forces were finally withdrawn in about May 2005 and given that we began to see the outbreak of significant instability in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
             East Timorese
            </a>
            defence force by the end of that year or early the following year, does the minister regard that as having been a wise course of action given the role played by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKF" rel="nofollow">
             PKF
            </a>
            over a long period of time in stabilising arrangements on the ground in Dili—a stabilising force both in the perception of various sides of East Timorese politics and in the capacity of the East Timorese defence force to continue to resolve their own internal difficulties in the absence of the stabilising presence of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations
            </a>
            peacekeeping force which had been there from 2002 onwards?
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, in the consideration of each of the Security Council resolutions of 2003, 2004 and 2005, the question arises: why did the government on each of those occasions decide to roll down Australia’s military commitment? Did the government of East Timor, in the consideration of any of those individual resolutions in New York, express a contrary view about that roll down? Did the foreign minister of East Timor express a contrary view, and why did Australia decide ultimately to pull its troops out, given that instability erupted so soon after?

             If that is the end of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
              East Timor
             </a>
             issues, I am happy to deal with a few of those issues without going into all of the details of consultations and discussions that there have been over those few years, including with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
              Security Council
             </a>
             members—in particular, the five permanent members—and with the East Timor government. Let me just make a broad point about this. I think we quite rightly took the view—and I feel very strongly about this—that a country like East Timor has got to learn to stand on its own two feet. It has got to learn to take responsibility for its own actions and behaviour. Political leaders in East Timor cannot expect the international community to be investing very heavily in their country, as well as in other countries which have difficult security or political situations, and to hold their hand indefinitely. I think one of the problems we have today in East Timor is that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
              East Timorese
             </a>
             leadership are looking too much to the international community to solve their problems and not enough to themselves and are not taking responsibility themselves for what has happened in their country.
            </p>
            <p>
             The purpose of the peacekeeping force was to deal with the problem of the Indonesian backed militias which were in East Timor—transgressions across the Indonesian border and the continuing activity of Indonesian backed militias—not to deal with political malfeasance amongst political players in East Timor. That was not the purpose of the peacekeeping force. The changes that took place in Indonesia, the work that the peacekeeping force and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
              UN
             </a>
             more generally, the United
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation" rel="nofollow">
              Nation
             </a>
             s police, have done in East Timor had, for all sorts of reasons, absolutely solved the problem of Indonesian backed militias in East Timor. In the context of the current crisis, I have no evidence that those Indonesian backed elements have been involved, that Indonesia has any part to play at all in the activities that are occurring in East Timor.
            </p>
            <p>
             With respect to the decisions that were made, the East Timorese have always wanted more support from the outside world than the international community has been willing to provide, but the fact is that the support in the context of Indonesia and the militias was decreasingly needed, and the decisions which were made at that time were the right decisions to make. What has happened recently is an entirely home-grown disaster. It is a disaster of the East Timorese’s own making. This is where I would quite strongly disagree with the opposition: the opposition’s proposition here, which I think is muddle headed, is that the international community should, in effect, take responsibility for East Timor and the East Timorese. I think, now that the country is independent and it is free of negative interference from the outside world—in particular from Indonesia—that the East Timorese should take responsibility for their own affairs. The current catastrophic situation in East Timor is brought about by poor management by the East Timorese of their own affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I said to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Ramos_Horta" rel="nofollow">
              Jose Ramos Horta
             </a>
             only last night on the telephone, we have been prepared to help out, given that the alternative, which was to do nothing, would have been catastrophic for the people of East Timor, but they must sort out their political problems themselves. They must learn to do that. We look forward to the East Timorese sorting out their political problems, because we have had troops there for a little while. We are, as the honourable member for Griffith is suggesting, going to send police. We have nearly 200 police there already. More police will be sent; there will be around 500 international police when they reach their full strength. But, at the end of the day, the East Timorese need to come to a political accommodation. They need to find political solutions and they need to deal with the problems of what are called the petitioners—the 595 people whom they sacked from the army and those other elements known as rebels who have left the army and who support the petitioners. They have to sort those problems out themselves. This notion that somehow we should have had hundreds upon hundreds of troops permanently in East Timor—

                I am pleased to speak today in my capacity as the federal member for Ryan, representing the western suburbs of Brisbane. Many of my constituents have a very deep and abiding interest in the foreign policy of this country. At the outset, let me commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his stewardship of the foreign affairs portfolio. I suspect history will judge him as this country’s finest foreign minister.

               <p>
                With my own interest in foreign policy and international affairs, I want to make some comments and ask the foreign minister about the Howard government’s relationships with our Pacific neighbours, how we are promoting our interests—

                  I am getting to that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am going to the topic of the amount of financial support which the Australian government is providing to our Pacific friends. Our bilateral relationships with countries such as the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
                   Solomon Islands
                  </a>
                  and

                   Papua New Guinea
                  </a>
                  are very extensive and diverse. On behalf of the electorate of Ryan, I am very keen to hear from the foreign minister about the nature of our support for those countries. Also, from the budget delivered by the Treasurer last month, what sorts of aid measures are we putting in place to assist the countries of the Pacific, particularly the Solomon Islands and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
                   PNG
                  </a>
                  , where I grew up and in which I have a very strong interest? How are we playing a role? How are the taxpayers of Australia strengthening the corporate governance of countries like PNG and the Solomon Islands? How are we helping their young people through mechanisms such as scholarships? How are we helping disadvantaged people in those countries through aid in health and education? We all know that

                  is a tremendous issue for Papua New Guinea. Our own nation has an obligation, I feel, to help as much as we can. I am keen to hear from the foreign minister about the measures that the government is putting in place to promote some of the issues I outlined. The people of Ryan are very keen to hear how Australian taxpayers’ dollars are spent in strengthening the countries of the Pacific.

                  <p>
                   I thank the member for Ryan for his excellent contribution. Firstly, I can give him some numbers. We will be spending an estimated $332 million on assistance to
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                    Papua New Guinea
                   </a>
                   during the course of this year. This money is increasingly focused in areas such as governance. As the honourable member will know, we have established the Enhanced Cooperation Program with Papua New Guinea. That involves sending not as many police as we had originally hoped; we were hoping to have police on the beat. That was impossible to do as a result of a challenge in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
                    Supreme Court
                   </a>
                   of Papua New Guinea. It is simply too complicated to change the constitution to provide for the legal protections that our police would need. Nevertheless, we have a considerable police presence there and that is being enhanced. In fact, only yesterday I met with Ministers Willie and Kimisopa from Papua New Guinea. We are taking a number of different initiatives to enhance our police cooperation and contribution. In the area of law and order, under the auspices of the Enhanced Cooperation Program, we are providing very significant additional assistance to Papua New Guinea.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Law and order is a big issue around the Pacific. In the rest of the Pacific we are spending around $434 million and are providing a lot of support, particularly to local police forces, to improve their capacity. In Fiji, for example, the police commissioner is an Australian,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
                    Andrew Hughes
                   </a>
                   , whom some members here—I think the member for Maribyrnong—may have met. Andrew Hughes is doing a simply outstanding job. We have the police commissioner in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
                    Solomon Islands
                   </a>
                   , who is doing what could only be described as a courageous job, and a number of Australian police are helping in countries around the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
                    South Pacific

                   .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have also been focusing very much on governance. One of the arguments that we put in our white paper on aid, and one of the arguments I have made for a very long time, is that the reason many countries are struggling is that they are badly run. It is as simple as that. It needs to be said and it needs to be understood. How can we help? We can help to improve the quality of governance. We have a series of programs around the Pacific in which Australians are assisting in improving the operation of government departments and the operation of service delivery mechanisms, particularly in areas like health, education and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The last point I want to make is that it is probably worth reminding the Committee that we are in the process of establishing an Australian technical college for the Pacific, and we will have more to say about that soon. I know members opposite favour the labour mobility proposal. The Labor Party’s position—and I think I have this right—is to allow unskilled workers from the Pacific to come to Australia. I think we should have more of a debate about that because it does not sit very comfortably with the new position of the Leader of the Opposition to keep migrants out of Australia. In relation to the Pacific very specifically, this is a position where we bring people in. I do not think the public know enough about that, but I am sure I will find the opportunity during the next week to draw their attention to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We think the challenge is not to bring unskilled labour into Australia; we think the challenge is to improve the skills of the people in the Pacific and to set up a technical college there. We have not announced yet where the college will be located or the detail of how it will work, but we have done a lot of work ourselves on that and will have more to say about it soon. I think that will make a very solid contribution to improving the capacity of the people in the Pacific to build their economies and build their welfare.

                     I would certainly welcome a debate with the minister on a broad range of matters. On questions of expenditure in relation to aid to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands" rel="nofollow">
                      Pacific Islands
                     </a>
                     , could the minister confirm that total funding for
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                      Papua New Guinea
                     </a>
                     and Pacific programs has fallen by 12 per cent in this budget, and specifically in relation to
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
                      PNG
                     </a>
                     by 34.1 per cent? I note that the failure to pick up implementing the Enhanced Cooperation Program mark 1 and the withdrawal of most Australian police would clearly explain a significant proportion of such a drop. Nonetheless, a drop of some 34 per cent is massive, particularly for a country which in the Pacific context is our most important neighbour and geographically our closest neighbour. Given the enthusiasm of the member for Ryan and the minister on the importance of programs, it seems somewhat anomalous that there is such a substantial drop when there are so many pressing needs in relation to development assistance in PNG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The minister might also confirm that funding for the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
                      Solomon Islands
                     </a>
                     is down by 11.8 per cent in this budget. Once again, given events in April, in particular in the Solomon Islands, that drop would also seem to be somewhat anomalous. I ask the minister to give us some further information as to how he sees the ongoing development of
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
                      RAMSI
                     </a>
                     and related programs in the Solomon Islands. I have had the opportunity on three occasions over the last 18 months to have discussions in the Solomon Islands with RAMSI staff, and I have to say that in general terms it is an outstanding program and one which clearly continues to have the support of the majority of Solomon Islanders. Having said that, the Solomon Islands is facing within the next decade potentially catastrophic economic circumstances. Therefore, whilst law, justice and governance programs are fundamental, against a backdrop where the Solomon Islands economy is facing a cliff because of the fact that the place is almost logged out—and logging is its principal source of foreign revenue—it would be useful to know how the minister sees the socioeconomic future of the Solomon Islands and the RAMSI context to that. Would the minister agree with me that there are deep-seated and serious long-term problems for the Solomon Islands economy and how does that sit with the government’s cut in aid funding to the Solomon Islands by almost 12 per cent?

                      I am happy to take up the points that the honourable member has raised and take the opportunity, too, of acknowledging the real interest he has in the Pacific. He has travelled there a lot and I think he has done a very good job in focusing on a lot of those issues. The parliament is grateful to him for the contribution he has made.

                             because of the anticipation that we were going to deploy police, including into community policing positions, so that was built into last year’s budget. Of course, we were not able to do that, so that expenditure is not going to take place. We would not just spend money willy-nilly on anything; we had the money set aside for that and the program has been much reduced, and that is the explanation. If you take the overall expenditure on the

                             , of course, I think you will find that, regardless of what the budget numbers say, there has been a rather substantial surge in expenditure in the Solomon Islands as we have deployed quite a number of

                             members and, from recollection, we have had to deploy an additional 70 or so police, mainly but not exclusively from the

                             In the context of providing aid, I am not of the view—as are, in particular, people on the political left around the world—that the measure of success is the amount of dough you spend. The measure of success is the efficacy of the programs you run, not how much they cost. You have to provide money to run the programs, but the benchmark for good aid should be good and successful outcomes and a tightly focused program, not just unloading bucket loads of money into the

In the last year, though, the Solomon Islands’ GDP grew by around four per cent. On the face of it, the honourable member might think that that is not such a bad figure and he might be pleased to hear that, and he should be. But it is not a great figure, because, to put that into some context, the Solomon Islands became independent in 1978. So, if you take 1980 as the benchmark for the Solomon Islands economy and work on the basis of a four per cent rate of growth—and, of course, there will be some disruption to economic growth caused by the events of a couple of months ago—the Solomon Islands’ per capita GDP will not return to what it was in 1980 until 2025. That is quite an alarming figure, so the honourable member is quite right to point to some of these issues and ask from where it will generate its economic growth.

                             Obviously, industries such as the timber industry, sustainably developed, and tourism have good potential—tourism has great potential in the Solomon Islands. If they could reopen the Goldridge mine, that, of course, would have a very substantial impact. That is potentially a good mine, but the political issues surrounding the mine need to be resolved. Solomon Islanders have to play a key part in resolving that, but those issues are being worked through and there is some prospect of that mine reopening. The mine made a major contribution to Solomon Islands’ GDP. I think it contributed a quarter or a third of its GDP; it was something in that vicinity. I think it has very good prospects. I can see my time is running short, so I will leave it there.

                                It is unfortunate that the minister has not been present until now and that he has brought with him his own professional filibusterer, the member for Ryan, to consume opposition time.

                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                                 East Timor

                                , Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, the matter we were discussing before you came into the chamber to assume the chair was the appropriate function being performed by a peacekeeping force under the United
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation" rel="nofollow">

                                s flag and whether in fact that had any broader function than policing the border. I think it is fair to say that the minister characterised as ‘muddle-headed’ a view which suggested that this sort of peacekeeping force had any function in the broader security of East Timor itself other than policing the border. I think that is a fair characterisation of the minister’s position.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                That being the case, it would make entirely muddle-headed the government’s current deployment because that is exactly what the government is now doing. The current force, in being on the ground in East Timor, is precisely dealing with how to resolve tensions arising from a failure in the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">

                                political process—tensions which have a capacity to spill over into the fragmented nature of the East Timorese defence force on the one hand and the East Timorese police force on the other. So if it was muddle-headed—this is a question for the minister to reflect upon and I would appreciate his answer to it—to ever have a view that the peacekeeping force prior to 2005 had such a function then presumably it is muddle-headed, in the minister’s argument, for them to be performing any function like that now. Of course, the reality is that, when we are dealing with complex matters on the ground in East Timor, there are a range of impacts which security presences on the ground perform, one of which is to provide broader stabilisation and the other to provide a confident environment in which the political process can operate.

                                The first question I would appreciate the minister considering in response to this intervention on East Timor is: again in that period 2002 to 2005, did the minister, in making decisions about the draw-down of Australia’s military presence under successive

                                security council resolutions, receive any advice from his department, or did the government receive advice more broadly, as to any consequences which would flow in terms of East Timor’s internal security? The second question it would be useful for the minister to reflect upon is: did the government receive any advice, given its responsibility for the training, primarily, of the East Timorese defence force, as to whether that defence force could effectively operate and manage any tensions within its own ranks once Australia withdrew from the field altogether? These are live considerations. The third question I would like the minister to address is this: in considering this draw-down of Australia’s military commitment to Timor between 2002 and 2005 and, furthermore, the consequences, effective or otherwise, of our training of the East Timorese defence force over that period of time, did the minister also receive advice in terms of Australia’s other military needs?

                                It needs to be registered—and I would ask the minister to reflect on this in his response—whether Australia’s military requirements in

                                and in Afghanistan at this time had a direct bearing on the government’s decision to cut and run from East Timor at this time. It is quite plain that the intense commitments arising from the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 were of significant moment within the ADF and the resources available for deployment. Furthermore, when Australia had initially cut and run from Afghanistan at the end of 2002 and then recommitted, after pressure from all sorts of quarters, a year or so later back to Afghanistan, was that also a material factor in the government’s consideration of how to sustain a military commitment to East Timor during that period of time? We all know that there are constraints on the defence budget. Therefore, I would appreciate the minister answering whether, over that critical three-year period which saw the successive drawn-down of Australia’s military commitment, he was in receipt of any advice or recommendation from the government as to where Australia’s military resources were better deployed vis-a-vis Iraq and Afghanistan.

                                 In relation to the East Timor defence force, which the honourable member raises, I suppose it is fair to say that this is a point of some disagreement between us. I am not sure about advice from other people, but as the minister I am entitled to my own view—funnily enough. All sorts of people give me advice. You should see some of the advice you get from the opposition. My view has been that it was a mistake for East Timor to have a defence force at all. The reason I think it was a mistake for East Timor to have a defence force is that a defence force in an emerging, developing country can have implications for internal security. I rest my case: my advice and my view were right—it has had implications for internal domestic stability. The East Timor government sacked 595 members of the East Timor defence force. That is two-fifths of the East Timor defence force. The implication by the opposition that somehow Australia, of all great countries—or, for that matter, the

                                 wanted a defence force because they wanted to ensure that the Falantil people, the people who were on the military wing of Fretelin and had been fighting in the hills against the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, had a role. Those people wanted to be in a defence force, so that is why they did what they did. But it was the wrong call and now they are stuck with a defence force, or what I could only describe now as the remnants of a defence force, and with those remnants they are going to have to work out what they will do. The East Timorese must take responsibility for their own decisions and their own actions. The East Timorese are responsible for the fact that they have a defence force. They are responsible for the sacking of 595 members of that defence force, not the United Nations and not Kofi Annan. Not even

                                 . We actually had 2,000 troops in Iraq during the initial invasion, not 20,000. Of course there was no advice that we should downsize in East Timor because of our commitment to Iraq. We progressively downsized—I think the largest number of troops we had there was around 5,700 at one stage. The opposition may think we should have kept 5,700 troops in East Timor. If they do not think that then they must have been in favour of downsizing. They were in favour of downsizing but not of downsizing so much—not that they ever said so or ever criticised the downsizing or the decision of the Security Council at the time. No, not at all. In fact, when it comes to Afghanistan, the opposition leader put out a press release congratulating the government on its decision to withdraw the special forces we had in Afghanistan at that time. Governments make decisions on the basis of the information they have at the time and judgments they make at the time. If we were all able to foretell the future—all of us—we probably would not be here; we would probably be at the races. This kind of constant strategy of the opposition saying, ‘We, the opposition, were able to foretell the future; the government wasn’t,’ is summed up in one word: childish.

                                  I have a few questions for the foreign minister in relation to our commitment to the Pacific region and territories. When I visited Vanuatu and Kiribati some years ago, I noticed that the Australian government provided a substantial patrol boat program. In fact, the economic zone around Kiribati is, I am told, as large as that of Australia. As a result, the patrol boat program to patrol their territorial waters had been seen to be somewhat welcome, but one of the criticisms was that, rather than actually using these patrol boats for the function for which they were intended, they had become interisland ferries. As a result, the actual patrol work was not being done and the local business people raised the issue that poaching was happening on a large scale, which had an effect on their fishing stocks
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Minister, could you provide me with any information, if you have it readily available, as to the current status of our commitment to the patrol boat programs to the Pacific island nations that I have referred to? Are we upgrading these fleets, and do we have an ongoing commitment? I noticed when I visited Honiara, for example, that there were two patrol boats in the harbour and apparently they had not left for some time. So I am interested in whether it is a good program that we should continue, given its lack of activity.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  The other issue I would like to raise is the activity of the Chinese and the Taiwanese governments in these island nations, which has also been under some scrutiny, for all the reasons that we are aware of. Also, there appears to be a large amount of Japanese investment in places like Kiribati and Tuvalu. Given the fact that we are endeavouring to seek their support on whaling, the Japanese seem to be providing similar support. The cynic in me tells me that Japan has probably very little interest in whaling around Tuvalu, for example, but is endeavouring to provide some economic enticement for their vote. Do you have any details which might support that view of mine? If so, could you outline what the extent of the dollar value of projects may be and what Australia is doing in response in economic aid to counteract that?

                                   The first point in relation to the patrol boat program is that this is part of the Defence Cooperation Program in the Pacific.

                                   years ago—I think it was during the life of the Hawke government; either the Fraser or the Hawke governments—the Australian government donated patrol boats to just about all of the Pacific island countries, including the countries mentioned by the honourable member. That program is now going through a process of reinvigoration and renewal in that these patrol boats are being refurbished and rehabilitated.

                                   Some of them have been quite well looked after and some of them less so. Under the Defence Cooperation Program we have people from the

                                   in a number of countries in the Pacific solely to assist with the maintenance of the patrol boats. I note the honourable member referred to the fact that in Honiara the two patrol boats sometimes sit in the harbour. I would have to say I am pleased to see that because I recall a couple of years ago that one of those patrol boats went down the Weather Coast and a little bit of machine gunning of the shore and people on the shore was done from the patrol boat. So the fact that it is tied up at the moment is not necessarily all bad news.

                                   In the case of Kiribati, the honourable member is right: the area for patrolling is simply massive, but the fact that they have some patrol boat capability is, at least, a minor deterrent to people conducting illegal fishing activities. These countries in the Pacific do not just depend on patrol boats; they also get assistance from the Royal Australian

I would not put it in the same league as in some other parts of the world. The honourable member is from Perth, and off the north-west coast of

                                   n and across the north coast of Australia the illegal fishing problem is a very significant one. What happens out in Kiribati, I suspect, is a relatively small problem on that scale.

                                   As far as whaling is concerned, we obviously provide aid programs to these countries and not in order to win their votes in international fora. To be fair, I suspect the Japanese are not motivated, at least solely, by trying to win their votes in the

                                   or other fora in the provision of their aid programs. Japan is a big aid donor in the Pacific and we are grateful for the work that the Japanese do. A lot of it is done in cooperation with us. There are allegations about some Japanese activities in some countries, not just in the Pacific but in the Caribbean and in other parts of the developing world and Africa. Obviously, in rounding up the votes in the International Whaling Commission, it is a fierce contest. We depend heavily on the votes of countries such as Luxembourg,

                                   and Andorra—and their fishing fleets are not big, I think you probably realise, if you think about those countries. The Japanese obviously work very hard to get votes as well in their own way.

                                   One final point I would make about this is that the argument that the Japanese have been putting to countries like Kiribati, whatever else may be behind the way they vote in the International Whaling Commission, is that whaling is important in the conservation of fisheries. They have been led to believe that the whales come and eat fish. It might not be an argument that appeals to us or to environmentalists, but it is an argument that has been sold, for example, to the Kiribati government, so you hear that from time to time. I thank the honourable member for his contribution.

                                       Thank you for the remonstration, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is always appreciated. The Australia-Indonesia relationship contains within the allocation to the aid program $165.9 million in 2006-07. The question to the minister in the short time remaining is: have you obtained from the Indonesians an assurance and a guarantee that

The second question I would pose to the minister in the remaining time is with regard to the allocation of $1.64 billion on the

                                             I think is outrageous. Let me try to get my point across through the fusillade of gabbling coming from the member for Griffith. In relation to

                                             in resolution 1267 and the decision of the 1267 committee to register Abu Bakar Bashir as a terrorist. Having done that, it means that it falls upon the Indonesian government to fulfil its obligations under that resolution. Those obligations include freezing the financial assets of Abu Bakar Bashir, which is obviously welcome, to ensure that he has no access to military equipment of any kind. The Indonesians have been working very hard in the area of counter-terrorism, including endeavouring to ensure that the messages taught in and sent out from the pesantren, the Islamic schools in Indonesia, are moderate and are broadly based messages.

                                             The suggestion that the Indonesians are soft on terrorism is quite wrong. The Indonesian government has done an excellent job in fighting terrorism. In relation to Abu Bakar Bashir, it can only be repeated that the government is deeply disappointed by the shortness of the sentence. The sentence was much shorter than we and the international community would have liked to have seen, and I think the Indonesian government shares that view. Contrary to the implication of what the honourable member has said, the Indonesian government is very concerned about Abu Bakar Bashir and his activities. The honourable member may have overlooked this, but the Indonesians themselves have suffered grievously from acts of terror by
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">

                                              I start by noting that once again the Minister for Health and Ageing has refused to attend for consideration in detail on the appropriations for the Health and Ageing portfolio. He is clearly in the parliament. Indeed, both he and I were just in the House dealing with a piece of health legislation. There is no reason why he could not have taken the same walk up the stairs that I did. The consistent refusal of the minister for health to defend the appropriations for Health and Ageing, I think, reflects poorly on his competence and on his understanding of the importance of parliament and is obviously meant to shroud from the opposition’s inquiry the appropriations in Health and Ageing. If he is too incompetent to defend his appropriations, one wonders why he is drawing a ministerial salary.

                                                Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. We will ask some questions of the parliamentary secretary for health, but of course much of what we would have wanted to question him on he will say he is not responsible for. This is just a mechanism to avoid accountability. Having said that, I will direct some questions on mental health to the parliamentary secretary, and I would appreciate very detailed answers to them.

                                                Madam Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, the Howard government has announced additional expenditure in mental health—$1.05 billion appears in the forward estimates of this budget—but none of the measures in the government’s mental health package have an implementation date. Will the parliamentary secretary, who is responsible for mental health, detail when each measure that the government has in its mental health package and which is the subject of appropriations in this budget will commence? Very little detail has ever been given about the measures that are the subject of the package. Given that detail must still be in the stage of development because it has not been publicly released, will the parliamentary secretary indicate whether it is the

I also ask: will the parliamentary secretary indicate what mechanisms are in place to ensure coordination with the states and territories on mental health issues?

                                                One of the measures is to allow Medicare rebating for mental health services. A fact sheet released by the government says that in the fifth year of operation it is expected that 35,000 people will see a psychiatrist under this Medicare rebating program and 400,000 Medicare services will be delivered by psychologists. I note that this compares with 100 million

Will the parliamentary secretary at the table confirm whether or not psychologists will have direct access to Medicare—that is, will a GP referral be required? Can he indicate whether psychologists will have direct access to Medicare for all services that they provide? Will every psychologist in the country have direct access to Medicare or will there be some credentialing process in order to get access, which means some psychiatrists may not qualify?

                                                   All right. I thank the shadow minister for her questions. I am delighted to be asked questions about mental health because, as she would know, mental health is my primary area of responsibility as the parliamentary secretary. I think the government has a very good story to tell about the mental health package in this budget. I am happy to answer her questions. I do not think any of them go to secrets that cannot be revealed. If it will assist her in promoting and supporting the government’s mental health package, then I am very happy to oblige.

                                                   As to the lead agency responsible for implementing the mental health package, there are a number of government departments that are responsible for different aspects. So, when the shadow minister says the funding is about $1 billion, it is just over $1 billion for Health and Ageing. But of course the whole package is worth about $1.9 billion and it is spread across a number of departments. FaCSIA’s role is one of the largest in the mental health package but

                                                   have put some new money on the table, but it is a long way short of what one would expect if one were providing $1.9 billion pro rata across the states. The New South Wales government has attempted to pretend that it has matched the funding at the Commonwealth level, but a large part of the expenditure that New South Wales has announced is a restatement of previous announcements, and Victoria is the same. One would have to say that at least they are trying, whereas in the Queensland budget last week there was not one extra dollar for mental health. They have made no attempt at all to match the Commonwealth’s very generous package.

                                                   In terms of the coordination of the states, I think I have answered that question: it has been coordinated through the COAG process. In July the national mental health action plan that was discussed in January will hopefully be signed off by the Commonwealth with all states and territories. We would expect all of those states and territories to make real commitments of dollars on the table for the mentally ill. I do not think the commencement dates of the various programs are a secret, and I am happy to tell the shadow minister. New early intervention services for parents, children and young people, at $28.1 million over five years, are expected to commence on 1 July 2006. The new funding for mental health nurses, the nursing care and support services, commences from July 2007, with a funding commitment of $191.6 million over five years. Improving the capacity of health workers in Indigenous communities, which is $20.8 million over five years, begins on 1 July 2006. Support for day-to-day living in the community, which is $46 million over five years, begins on 1 July 2006.

                                                                In fact, I praise the member for Holt again for his support for autism in the Committee the other day. In terms of my interest in autism, I support a local group called the Unique Mothers, for mothers of children with autism in the Canning electorate. One problem is that people with autism suffer greatly because, as I understand it—and the parliamentary secretary can confirm this or otherwise—autism receives less funding than other areas of health because it is not considered a syndrome. Because it is not considered as a specific syndrome, it does not receive funding as such.
                                                               </p>

                                                                I know that this is an area that comes under the responsibility of the parliamentary secretary. I receive many representations from parents of children with autism. For example, in Canberra there is a group called A4, which is very active in contacting us in relation to further funding and resourcing for parents of children with autism. My question to the parliamentary secretary is: what programs and funding does the federal government continue to assign to autism? One of the areas that parents of children with autism are continually seeking support on is early identification and early programs. The earlier you take on the role of identifying and then working with children with autism, the better the results are.
                                                               </p>

                                                                One other area of great need for parents of children with autism is respite. It is not just about respite; it is about flexible respite. By way of an aside, in an adopt-a-politician program in

                                                                , which is largely unique to Western Australia, I have adopted a boy with autism. I went through a formal adoption process in the state parliament to do so—along with other members on both sides of parliament, state and federal—to help people with disabilities. I would recommend to the parliamentary secretary that this program be funded so that it can become an Australia-wide program. It not only helps awareness but also helps the parents involved in many different ways, which I will not go into now because of time constraints.
                                                               </p>

                                                                Flexible respite is needed for when a parent is absolutely at their wit’s end. We know that in the past some parents have actually harmed their autistic child because they cannot take it any longer. Flexible respite is something they crave. There is no point in saying, for example, ‘You have a respite time next Sunday between the hours of two and six,’ because you might not need it then. You need respite when the child is absolutely out of control or the parent has had enough. This stops harm. In fact, I understand there have been cases where parents have caused the death of their child. That is how serious the matter is. I ask the parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the parents of children with autism: what programs and funding have we allocated in this budget and what can we do into the future for this very needy program?

One of my goals in the next 12 months is to work on an autism package.

Many children with autism spectrum disorder were falling through the cracks in the various definitions in the criteria and we enabled the carer of any child with autism spectrum disorder to have access to carers allowance and carers payment, so that was an improvement for them last year. We are making gradual steps forward in each budget, but I would like to be able to do more for them in next year’s budget.
                                                                 </p>

The member for Canning would remember that we had a conference here last year, which I initiated with the member for Casey, who is also a passionate advocate for services and support for families with children who have autism. That conference came up with a number of recommendations, one of which was a research project to drill down into what sorts of services would be useful for people with autism spectrum disorder. That has been funded and is nearing completion, and we will soon have the response from the research that arose from that conference we held last year.
                                                                 </p>

One problem with respite, of course, is that the services are largely provided by the states under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Unfortunately, because of that, the Commonwealth have little control over how that money is spent. We would like to have a lot more control. I think there is a chink of light for us in that area, because the mental health package also contains support for 650 new respite places for people with mentally ill children. Therefore, I guess we have broken the dam wall a bit through this mental health package, and we might look to see how we could do that further in areas that affect families with children affected by autism.

My question once again is: under this measure, will all psychologists have access to Medicare for every service they provide? If it is not for every service, what services is it for? If it is not for every psychologist, how will psychologists have such access determined? Will psychologists have direct access to Medicare or will there need to be a

Does the government have an average figure for out-of-pocket costs paid by patients who currently access psychiatrists who are entitled to Medicare rebating? If so, what out-of-pocket cost does the government project that people will be required to pay for accessing psychologists with the benefit of Medicare rebating? To pick up the point of the member for Canning: it is one thing to say that people will get access to psychological services and have a Medicare rebate to support them, but if the remaining out-of-pocket cost is still prohibitive then that obviously creates an access issue. We would like an answer to that question from the parliamentary secretary.
                                                                  </p>

The parliamentary secretary would be aware that funds are provided under the budget to increase access to treatment services provided by workers such as psychologists, social workers and mental health nurses in rural and remote areas, but the delivery mechanism for this funding is not at all defined. How will these services be delivered? Will it involve Better Outcomes for Mental Health—once again, that relates to whether or not that program is going to still be in existence—or will the delivery mechanism be the More Allied Health Services Program? Will accessing the services of a psychologist, social worker or mental health nurse require a GP referral? How many services are expected to be delivered each year under this program? What types of services are going to be funded and provided by these health professionals?

I think we are up to the better access to psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, to which many of her questions related, so I will return to that. The start-up date is 1 November 2006 and the amount of money is $538 million over the next five years. Funding for telephone counselling, self-help and web based support programs is expected to begin on 1 July 2006. There is $56.9 million over five years for that. Assistance for the national telephony system is one payment this financial year—that is $2.4 million to Lifeline.

I think she has played a significant role in ensuring that money has been put aside for this issue. That begins on 1 July 2006 and it involves $21.6 million over four years.

It has certainly been very well received by the psychology organisations that I have had discussions with and by psychologists generally who have talked to me. It is the substantial item in the package—it is $538 million—and I think it will make a substantial difference in access to psychiatrists,

The answer to that question is yes. Psychologists will only be able to access the Medicare Benefits Schedule on referral from a GP or a psychiatrist. Psychologists who will be able to be referred to will be a certain category of psychologists. Not every psychologist in Australia will be able to receive a referral from a GP or a psychiatrist; they will have to meet certain criteria. We are working through those criteria at the moment with the stakeholders, obviously, to ensure that those people who see psychologists under this Medicare Benefits Schedule item are ones who have practical clinical experience rather than every psychologist who currently has qualifications, of which there are many, many thousands, not all of whom—in fact, less than half of whom—would have clinical experience in recent history. So we want to make sure that those—

Perhaps in the next five minutes he can conclude his previous answer and ensure that these questions are answered too. The parliamentary secretary made reference to the web linked services and the call centre services in the mental health budget appropriations.

Why is there no inclusion of a continuation of this initiative, given the desire for web based support programs for people with mental illness and that this has been a successful one? Will there be any initiatives that would link depressioNet, a current and successful initiative, to the new system?

There is also a reference to full-time and part-time postgraduate scholarships for nurses and psychologists. Can he give us the breakdown of what funding will be directed to scholarships for nurses as opposed to the funding that will be directed to scholarships for psychologists? As he would be aware, the scholarship initiative is just bundled together. Given the significant educational costs faced by those who do not access scholarships—the parliamentary secretary is aware that the cost for someone who seeks to be a mental health nurse, given mental health nursing is a postgraduate course, is in the order of $50,000 a year and in the order of $20,000 a year for a person who seeks to be a psychologist—how many scholarships are going to be provided in each category and how many places, therefore, will be left without the benefit of a scholarship, leaving people to face those sorts of costs in order to access the course?

The member for Lalor also asked whether psychologists should be able to access the MBS item for all the services they provide and the answer to that is no. They will be able to access only the MBS item for services referred to them by a GP or psychiatrist. How that will be done in detail I cannot tell the shadow minister at this point, but I can certainly go into the detail that answers her question, which is that they will be able to access the MBS item for a service that has been referred to them by a GP or a psychiatrist but they will not be able to unilaterally apply the MBS to all of the services they provide.

That program continues and I am not aware of why the member would think we are scrapping it. It is possible that she has information which has not been provided to me and I would be more than happy to receive that information if she wants to write to me or to ring my office. I am sure we can facilitate a discussion over that matter. She may want to provide me with that information because I have no instructions that that is the case. The government is a very enthusiastic supporter of the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care package. We think it is making a substantial difference. Certainly the number of GPs who are being trained in mental health and all the stakeholders are happy to see it expand rather than not so. In the Youth Mental Health Foundation measure which was announced before the budget $15 million of the $69 million was put aside for GPs to work through the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care package in order to help young people, particularly with early intervention. There is no enthusiasm on the part of the government for the scrapping of Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care. I look forward to that continuing as a vibrant and active part of our arsenal of activities with which we seek to help people with mental illness.

I think that is what she was getting at in terms of psychologists being able to access the MBS, therefore how much out-of-pocket expenses clients would be expected to provide. I can tell her that we are currently working closely with stakeholders on what the rebate should be. There is obviously a divergence of view, as the member for Lalor would expect, between what  psychologists would like to receive and what GPs and psyhiatrists and others think psychologists should receive. I am not in a position to tell her today what the rebate will be but we are close to finalising those figures and that will be announced well in advance of the 1 November start-up date on which we expect this new MBS item to come on board.

What has happened to the more than 100 others that are missing? I ask that the parliamentary secretary, in the time remaining, address those questions and the remaining mental health questions.

I think I was up to the distribution of psychologists. The answer is that this $51.7 million is designed to assist in the roll-out of psychologists and mental health nurses to rural and remote areas. We expect that that will assist. We understand that the ‘spatial distribution’, as the member for Lalor has coined it, is not as perfect as we would like it to be. That is why the Minister for Health and Ageing has a number of programs in place to try and address that issue.
                                                                            </p>

In some areas Aboriginal health services will be used and in other areas regional health services will be used. Obviously, whatever service that is available and appropriate in the area will be the one that the Commonwealth puts to use for this program, but our leading area of rolling this out will be through the Australian Divisions of General Practice, in which we have great confidence.

I am pleased to say that we are putting substantial funds into internet, telephone and counselling services. The member for Lalor would know, as would most members of the House, that the first source of treatment or advice for teenagers and young people is not going to be their parents or even their peers. If they have concerns about their mental health, they will happily go to the internet for advice—and, to some extent, self-treatment—because it is anonymous and they can find out a great deal of information. So the Commonwealth is putting substantial funds aside for the internet to try to reach young people.

That is a question that is best put to Lifeline and the Kids Help Line. It is not something that I would necessarily know. Therefore, the member for Lalor might wish to approach Lifeline and the Kids Help Line. I am sure in their annual reports she would be able to find the answers to those questions, but I am not going to answer them because it is not part of my particular responsibility.

DepressioNet was given extra funding last year by the minister for health. DepressioNet is perfectly able to apply for funding under this mental health package. DepressioNet has not been singled out for mention in the budget; neither was MoodGYM or any of the other web based services that are available. Like them, depressioNet is more than welcome to apply for funding under the package and if it is successful in achieving it then good luck to it.

I am happy to take it on notice and ask the department to see whether they can come up with a breakdown. I imagine that, because these are not commencing until 2007 and many of the other parts of the program are commencing in July 2006, the specific breakdown of scholarships between nursing and psychology has probably not yet been decided. It is a matter that will obviously be decided before the end of this year and the member for Lalor will be one of the first to find out, I am sure, as will the institutions that are providing this training to the 420 new nurses and 200 new clinical psych places that the Commonwealth has put aside as part of this mental health package. As the member for Lalor and other members of the House would know, there is a chronic shortage of the labour that is required in the workforce in this area.

I would point out to her that the minister for health has primary responsibility for those areas and, as a consequence, I am happy for him to answer those questions if he chooses to do so.

Is it correct that this will not include major parts of the country? If so, which parts of Australia will miss out and when will there be a national program? Is the limitation on the roll-out because there is currently no way of ensuring that people who get a positive first instance test result will be able to get access to a colonoscopy? What procedures are in place to ensure that everybody who gets a positive first instance test result will get a colonoscopy in a reasonable time frame?

I have, for almost an hour now, been happy to answer questions generally in the department of health, but I thank her for asking questions specifically in my areas of responsibility so that we could have a useful exchange in this part of the parliamentary process. But, for those areas which are the particular responsibility of the minister for health, such as nutrition, obesity and the like and the cancer-screening program to which she has referred, I am happy to refer those matters to the minister for health. How he chooses to respond to the member for Lalor is best placed in his hands.

However, there are other areas where I would really appreciate some direct answers in relation to a couple of issues.

The member for Cowan rightly outlined the initial announcement at that time. For completeness, I should emphasise that quite a deal of consternation followed the announcement of the initial eligibility criteria, to the point where the government engaged in quite an extensive range of consultations with ex-service organisations, and I can provide a list of those. That occurred largely before my appointment on 27 January, which I am sure the member for Cowan is aware of. There was also consultation and discussion within the government.
                                                                                 </p>

There were issues around particularly women. Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, you may have had representations, as I had, that the actual period of initial enlistment for women was in some cases under the minimum eligibility criteria for the medal. There were also other issues we characterised as employment related policies within Defence. For example, if a female member serving in the defence forces fell in love, she was invited to leave. If she was married, she was invited to leave. If she became pregnant, she was invited to leave, and some other relationships that she may have been involved in also could have meant there was an invitation to leave.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  In that light, the review was carried out. The defence chiefs were involved; the government revisited that eligibility criteria. The member for Cowan is quite right: the emphasis on ‘volunteer’ was removed because the focus of the ADM, and the announcement that I made on behalf of the government, went to the question of service and all of the things that the member for Cowan mentioned about a preparedness to serve, to be called upon, to defend the country and to be involved in other defence related activities in the national interest.
                                                                                 </p>

The view was also taken that people might have had other career plans for their lives. They might have wished to do other things with their lives, but they were called upon through national service to also serve and, if they fulfilled that obligation appropriately and satisfied the enlistment period, they were equally deserving of having their service recognised.
                                                                                 </p>

This is true; it is a cause of consternation and it has been raised with me. What I have emphasised is that the ADM is to recognise service, and service has been provided and deserves recognition, regardless of the pathway that brought people to serve our country, and to serve well.

It is a ceremonial medal, not an honour or an award, yet many are saying it is still a medal, and some of the volunteers feel quite strongly that they have not been given the level of recognition for their voluntary service. I have met with a number of veterans organisations recently, and I am sure the member for Cowan would know they have put their views quite vigorously to me, and some points of view I have taken on board. The eligibility criteria for the ADM are sound, principled and, I think, entirely defensible. They will not be changed. The question of whether someone who was a national serviceman is receiving both the ADM and can claim the commemorative

Firstly, I encourage the minister to look at the reason why there are such long delays in the provision of this medal, and why there are anomalies arising where people with the same sorts of service eligibility are being, on the one hand, rejected, while others in exactly the same situation, on the other hand, are being approved.

I know the minister is aware of this issue, and I want to ask him whether he feels that the officers who actually fought in the battle have been treated fairly. I want to know whether he feels that the downgrading of their bravery awards was a fair thing to have happened at the time and, particularly in this year—the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan—what action he intends to take to review those bravery awards, which were given to the officers who actually took part in the battle—the trigger pullers, the men who fought the fight? I want to know what steps he is going to take to rectify what is now becoming a longstanding embarrassment to our honours and medals system.

I think there have been about 7½ thousand Australian defence medals issued within about eight weeks—but I will check the exact number. My sense is that, with all the medals that have been issued in recent times, the
                                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                    experience would be at the high-water mark. But, if the member for Cowan is aware of some eligibility issues or some anomalies in the implementation of what I think is a sound and principled eligibility framework, I would welcome receiving that information. I am encouraged by the turnaround time in applications, and the way defence honours and awards are processing those medals is a credit to them. We are still working through a considerable backlog with other awards, and I am encouraged by the whole team’s effort to get those awards out to people who so richly deserve them.
                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                    On the second point, the member for Cowan knows that I have some incredible sympathy for those people involved in the battle and the circumstances surrounding the recognition of their service, their gallantry and their honour. He knows how I feel about that. Dave Sabben is a man whom I greatly admire and count as a friend. I receive much wise counsel from him and, via him, some advice and thoughts from the individuals involved in the battle. One of the things that I have turned my mind to is what I can do about the feelings and residual sentiments of those individuals about how they were treated some 40 years ago. One of the issues that I confront is that I am not able to change the history of the time. There were some decisions made at that time by people in the command structure who were not immediately part of the action but who were close to it. I am not sure how safe it is for me to second-guess judgments made by serving members of the ADF who, in all the circumstances of that battle and our engagement in Vietnam at that time, arrived at some conclusions that differed from the immediate hierarchy of those very brave men involved in that incredible fight.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    Member for Cowan, my issue is that, having recognised my sense that there has been an injustice here, my second step is trying to find a positive way of responding to it without inadvertently bringing into question the judgments about the medals, honours and recognitions not just from that battle but from the Battle of Coral and all the other conflicts that were part of our Vietnam engagement. So I have sought some advice on that. I have spoken widely about it. I am seeking wise counsel from people about what I am able to do, given the current law. I am keen to see what I can do. Precisely what that is, I do not know just yet. I am not sure.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    There are issues about imperial medal systems that we do not have with us any longer. There are issues about reopening some assessments made at the time, on the ground, by people directly involved in full recognition of all the circumstances. As someone who was barely a pup when that battle happened, how wise is it for me to revisit some of those judgments? If they were to be revisited, what is a fair and equitable way of honouring the services of the people involved while not in some indirect way dishonouring the services of others who were involved? These are the things that I am grappling with. Frankly, I would welcome a chat with the member for Cowan if he has some views on that, because I share his sentiment. The road forward to remedy it, though, is less clear.

Firstly, can he provide any detail to the House regarding what commitments have been made with respect to funding for the children of Vietnam veterans health study? That is an issue on which I can assure him there is cross-party support. Secondly, the minister would also be aware there has been quite a furore in elements of the veterans community regarding comments attributed to him in the Cynthia Banham article in the

I welcome the opportunity to again make that point, as I did to the national congress of the Vietnam veterans in Nerang.

He would be aware that the feasibility study has now been completed. There was some considerable discussion, debate, disagreement—argy-bargying, if I could put it that way—in the preparation of that feasibility study, involving a scientific advisory committee and a consultative committee. The report that has come to me points to some risks, some concerns, some hazards about undertaking certain kinds of research and proposes that we undertake a pilot study, which of itself would take a number of years to complete, just to see if the methodology that people think might work will actually reveal some new insights.
                                                                                     </p>

To sit back and procrastinate for a number of years in the hope of a full study that may lead to some new insights I think is to do a disservice to the Vietnam veteran community and their sons and daughters. What I have targeted is a more staged approach that can get earlier insights sooner, that enables us to respond to those insights as they arise, adapt and change our services to meet those new insights, and then go further on with the research. This is a stepping forward process. That will get us meaningful results sooner and we can better target our health and support programs for the sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans and we can extend that study as far as it needs to go to find the insights that we are looking for to make sure that we get services delivered and parallel research as well.

I am not going to agree to a study that risks treating serving personnel differently on the basis of the service that they undertook. I am also not going to conduct a study which may not be helpful to the veterans community because it has not taken account of the healthy soldier effect. The shadow minister would know that we only recruit healthy people. If we cannot find a comparative group that takes account of the fact that we start with a healthier cohort in the community of the serving personnel than the broader community then some of those analytical comparisons might mask the very insights we are looking for.

One final comment, though, is that there is a body of non-veteran related research too which I think might be instructive. How do we make sure that insights gained in the broader community can be brought to bear on what is very much a veterans related body of work helping the sons and daughters of people who served in Vietnam? That is where that is heading and I am happy to keep you informed of the progress.

The minister announced in a media release on 31 May the commencement of new training roles for our troops in Iraq. The first one is at a basic training centre and another will be at a counterinsurgency academy. The first issue I wanted to ask is: roughly, how many of our troops will be involved in those training tasks?

Is the minister able to explain a little more as to what will be involved in that security overwatch? In particular, where will our troops primarily be allocated, how many roughly will be involved, who will we be with and what backup resources, importantly, will be provided to our troops in that role? In particular, there was a controversy regarding the provision of helicopter support in the

Will that similar sort of support be available and will it be in the context of the British retaining an involvement, presumably in an area in southern Iraq, or will it be in the context of the British actually scaling down their contribution?

In Singapore on the weekend before last, in a meeting with Minister Nukaga, the Japanese minister, I again made it very clear to him that, whilst we are very supportive of supporting the Japanese engineers, who have done a tremendous job in Al Muthanna, clarity on their future would be greatly appreciated by us in terms of future planning. The Japanese minister has made it clear to me that one of the things that is important to Japan, apart from supporting basically what we are all trying to achieve in Iraq, is that the move to the Iraqi national government and the appointment of key ministers, and then the transfer to provincial Iraqi control in Al Muthanna, will be key milestones in their own decision making.
                                                                                       </p>

We are disposed to redeploying the approximately 460 Australian troops who are currently protecting the Japanese engineers in Al Muthanna to other tasks in the southern part of Iraq. We are not at this stage prepared to specifically nominate where they will be predominantly based, because we are negotiating that with the Iraqis, the British and our other allies, including the Italians. We are, however, certainly not disposed to being based in Basra, which seems to be occupying the minds of certain people in the media—if not the opposition.

We have already provided training to the Iraqi 2nd Brigade of the 10th Division and the Iraqis in Al Muthanna province are themselves already providing security forces and protection. Apart from training, mentoring and working cooperatively with the provincial Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces, we envisage that, along with our coalition partners, we will be in a position to provide direct assistance to the Iraqi security forces should it be absolutely necessary to do so—in the same way that our own defence forces in Australia might occasionally, but very rarely, be required to provide aid to the civilian community. We are at the moment having detailed negotiations with the Iraqis and our coalition partners as to the terms and conditions under which we would do that. It is absolutely essential to the Australian government that we have that clearly defined before we move to that phase of our support in the southern part of Iraq. This will be one of the issues I will be discussing with the

In that context, has the Australian government voiced its concerns regarding reports that militia connected in particular with the minister for the interior may have been involved in—and it would be naive to assume that they do not continue to be involved in—sectarian violence? To what extent is that a concern of the Australian government? It is at least perceived that militia connected with the government have been involved in sectarian violence. Insofar as it seems that this new role would be a security overwatch role more closely connected with the Iraqi security forces, to what extent should we question at least in part the connection of the Iraqi security forces with elements involved in sectarian violence? To what extent would that make Australian troops subject to retaliation? What precautions will be taken to protect our troops in the event that they are the focus of attacks by elements within the Iraqi population—namely, those more aligned to the Sunni elements?

The next phase is going to be very dangerous for some of the reasons which the member for Barton raises and, indeed, for a lot of others, but it is the next very important phase in the campaign in the sense that provinces in southern Iraq, in

I can only say by way of reassurance that that is one of the priority issues which we are actively discussing at the moment and, whilst we are in principle disposed to redeploying to this particular role known as Operation Overwatch, we will not do so until we are satisfied that the risks have been managed to our satisfaction.

The total number of troops is in the order of 1,400 on the ground. I have questions with respect to East Timor. To what extent has there been an analysis of the adequacy of the skill sets of our troops—that is not to demean their professionalism or dedication—in terms of controlling civil unrest and the capacity to quell riotous behaviour? Has there been an assessment of whether there was a need to, or whether there may be a need to in the future in similar situations, provide troops with riot gear, such as shields, riot helmets and so forth? To what extent will there be an evaluation as to whether we need to focus on that broader crowd and riot control skill set in the ADF? It has recently been pointed out to me that we have a military police battalion in the Victorian police that is trained to a riot control standard. To what extent, if any, has consideration been given to either expanding the capacity of that battalion or creating a similar skill set? That is not simply for a response in East Timor but, presumably over the next decade, may be required should a riot erupt in the Solomons or, regrettably, in some other country.

In particular, there was a reference to an allegedly secret memorandum—which the minister may not want to comment on—suggesting that as early as 2001 there were reports of the risks of the then embryonic East Timor defence force being susceptible to infiltration by criminal elements and also the potential for the former guerrilla fighters to fracture on the basis of ethnic and geographic lines. To what extent will the Australian government review the adequacy of training that we provided to the East Timorese defence force with a view to identifying whether it could have been done better and, indeed, with a view to looking at how we may wish to do it in the future in East Timor or other countries in the region?

With respect to the skill sets of MPs, obviously the member for Barton has taken a much more active interest in what has happened in East Timor than perhaps the average everyday Australian whom we all represent. But if you look at the circumstances which led to our predeployment and then the deployment of our Defence Force, it was obvious that we needed a military presence and we needed it there quite quickly once the events rapidly unfolded. What happened, as is our experience, by virtue of the presence in considerable numbers of Australians, Malaysians,

Whilst we have discussed this, we have no specific plans to develop it. As an Australian, apart from being the Minister for Defence, I do not particularly want to see Australian soldiers doing police work. Both of those roles are important, but they are quite different.

The Australian government, I am advised, gave advice through our ADF to the East Timorese sovereign government about the nature, size and composition of its security forces, both policing and military. The East Timorese government, as it is perfectly at liberty to do, chose a particular path and we provided training.

Minister, I am appalled by the decision that the government took not to make this warlike service, and I say this very strongly in the context of the message which was delivered to the soldiers and to the families by you, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by the Prime Minister, when in the parliament the Prime Minister gave rise to the dangerous nature of the deployment and told the House and the people of Australia and the soldiers who were going there that we could expect casualties. Minister, I ask you one simple question: why did the government not immediately declare the deployment to be warlike and then review that warlike designation perhaps four or six weeks into the deployment? Why did the government not give the benefit of the doubt to the troops? They went there expecting dangerous situations and casualties and they went there expecting to operate in a warlike environment. Why didn’t the government recognise that up front and then take the opportunity to review that decision once things had settled down?

I cannot express enough my admiration to Bruce and his family for their significant contribution to our country. It is extraordinary. In terms of warlike or non-warlike, the definition of what is warlike or non-warlike occupied the mind of the then Keating government in 1992. It then spent a long time working with the

There were essentially six categories that were defined and approved in 1993 by the then Keating government, three of them falling into warlike and three of them falling into non-warlike.

The way the definition or the recommendation works is that there is a Strategic Operations Division in the Australian Defence Force. It comprises a variety of people from the ADF, who themselves have significant deployment experience. Two principal things are taken into account. One is the military risk and the other is the environmental risk. The military risk involves the threat to life that is presented by the military task that lies ahead, and there is also environmental risk. For example, the maintainers of our C130s in the

They have to work for 20 minutes and have a 40-minute break, and that is a significant environmental risk, as you could imagine.

In fact, before the deployment, the Prime Minister said, and I think I may also have said, that it had the potential to be riskier than it was in 1999. As you know, we had then, and we still have, renegade rebel groups of armed soldiers, and possibly civilians, up in the hills. As you know, on the day prior to the deployment we had—and it will be the subject of an investigation—what would appear to be the murder of unarmed people on the streets of Dili.
                                                                                              </p>

That was accepted by me and it was a whole-of-government decision that it be non-warlike. Were we to take the advice of the member for Cowan, as distinct from the Australian Defence Force itself, and declare it to be warlike prior to the deployment, I cannot begin to imagine the environment that would have been created by the government establishing something as warlike and then having to present to the Australian Defence Force why the definition and terms of deployment and conditions of service would suddenly change. Further to that, the conditions of service are paid from the day of deployment. So in any real sense, whatever the ultimate decision made is, the conditions of service and the money that is paid to the Defence Force personnel remain as whatever the determination of the ADF, supported by the government, is.

It said, ‘What is the difference?’ The difference is that in Baghdad the car has been the subject of an attack, probably using an improvised explosive device, possibly a suicide bomber, and anywhere from a small number to 30 people will have been killed. The target of that attack is coalition forces, of which the Australians are but one. In Dili, the burnt-out car is the result of an arson attack by a group of vandals and youths who are in organised gang related attacks. It is a different environment.

I also add that the field allowance in Dili is $42.80 a day. In Iraq, it is $25 a day. The field allowance is higher in Dili because environmentally, as distinct from militarily, it is a more difficult place for our soldiers to be living.

In fact, he wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to that effect. He has made a very clear distinction between risk in Iraq and risk in East Timor. The allowance for our soldiers in East Timor is $128 a day for a soldier with dependants and $121 a day for those without dependants. In addition to that, from day 91 every dollar is tax free. The deployment allowance is $78.60, which is tax free from the day that they arrive. The tax free arrangements from day 91 apply from the first day of deployment.
