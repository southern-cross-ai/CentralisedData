       <p>
        I rise today to highlight the work of two outstanding and talented authors in my local community of Ryan who are ensuring that our local history is preserved. Firstly, there's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Garrett" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Garrett
        </a>
        , the former president of the Mandalay Progress Association, who recently released a book titled
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roads" rel="nofollow">
          The Roads
         </a>
         to
        </i>
        <i>
         Mandalay
        </i>
        . The book provides a historical road map of the development of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_Tree_Pocket" rel="nofollow">
         Fig Tree Pocket
        </a>
        and the estate of Mandalay. I was delighted to attend the launch and receive the finished product of the book, after months of thorough research by Malcolm and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPA" rel="nofollow">
         MPA
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mandalay Progress Association was established after the 1974 floods that hit Brisbane, to support residents and to develop community spirit in the area, and it follows that mission faithfully today. The current MPA President, Joseph Tam, has gone above and beyond to support Malcolm in producing the book. So I give my thanks to Joseph as well. I encourage all local residents from Fig Tree Pocket and the surrounding area to get a copy of Malcolm's book. It's a fantastic read.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday I also attended the launch of Ruth Bonetti's new book,
        <i>
         The Art Deco Mansion in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Lucia" rel="nofollow">
          St Lucia
         </a>
        </i>
        , which is about the heritage listed site on Hawken Driveâ€”a local landmark for St Lucia. It is also about Ruth's grandfather, who was the mastermind behind the design of the home. She wrote the book to honour his life, his story and the contribution he made to the local community. The house was constructed in 1950. It was an architectural design well ahead of its time and still stands today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both of these books are the love, sweat and tears of their authors. I commend both the talented authors and their wonderful books to our local community.
