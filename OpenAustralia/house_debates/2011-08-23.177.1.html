        I congratulate Ipswich Rugby League and all its many sponsors and proud partners on its presentation night. The event was held at the federally funded
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ipswich" rel="nofollow">
         North Ipswich
        </a>
        reserve conference centre. The centre is a wonderful facility. The federal Labor government's $3.3 million under the Better Regions program was money well spent by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        as owner of the reserve. I was pleased to have secured this funding for Ipswich. The centre has a fantastic view of the oval and it has a modern industrial kitchen which can cater for hundreds. This facility, located in the Ipswich CBD and opposite

        , is once again a demonstration of Labor's commitment to Ipswich.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rugby league is Ipswich's most beloved sport. It is the most popular sport in Ipswich and its rural surrounds. Thousands of junior players and many clubs in the sports pages of local newspapers such as the
        <i>
         Queensland Times
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Ipswich
        </i>
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        testify to rugby league's popularity in Ipswich. The trains to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp_Stadium" rel="nofollow">

        in Brisbane on the Ipswich line are full regardless of the standard of opposition played by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Broncos
        </a>
        . Rugby league in Ipswich was established in 1910. Ipswich has a long, proud history in rugby league. From the days of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimba_Cup" rel="nofollow">
         Bulimba Cup

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Kelly" rel="nofollow">

        With the proposed expansion of the

        </a>
        in 2013 and the granting of a new licence, I urge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        to look with favour upon Ipswich. I welcome and endorse the western corridor bid, with Ipswich at its heart. The bid includes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        and the country areas in between. The population of this district makes Penrith look tiny in comparison. The western corridor is rugby league heartland, and it is the fastest growing area in Queensland. If granted the licence, the western corridor team would play initially at Suncorp stadium in Brisbane, giving South-East Queensland rugby league fans another home game to watch. I applaud the efforts of those involved in the bid, including the western corridor bid chairman Steve 'Johno' Johnson, bid consultant

        Brad Wolens and many others. The Ipswich City Council and the community—business and sporting—are right behind this bid, which has support at every level of government.

         David Gallop
        </a>
        and the NRL hierarchy: just look at the success of the Brisbane Broncos, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland_Cowboys" rel="nofollow">

        . Look at the many successive years of victory by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_State_of_Origin" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland State of Origin
        </a>
        team. The evidence is in. It is conclusive and persuasive. The centre of gravity in rugby league is now north of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed River
        </a>
        . The western corridor is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        equivalent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , only projected to grow much faster. In the next 20 years, Ipswich alone, with a population of 175,000, will grow to more than 400,000. It is time to grant the licence to South-East Queensland and to the Western Corridor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate all those involved in Ipswich rugby league clubs affected by the 2011 floods: Lowood, Norths,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End" rel="nofollow">
         West End
        </a>
        and Goodna, and junior clubs such as Karalee Tornadoes. These clubs have been rebuilt or are rebuilding their facilities. They have fielded teams under the most adverse circumstances. Well done to their club secretaries, treasurers and committees. Well done also to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRL" rel="nofollow">
         IRL
        </a>
        chairman Jack Rhea and operations manager Brendan Rose, and all their team. Brendan, you did a good job as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        for the event. This federal Labor government and the Queensland state Labor government have worked well to rebuild rugby league in Queensland, including with a $1.4 million commitment to assist clubs affected by the flood. Ipswich Rugby League received $185,000 of this money to help local clubs. It was fitting that A-grade player of the year was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_West" rel="nofollow">
         Steve West
        </a>
        , from flood affected Norths, a club which had to play away all season. I congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blair" rel="nofollow">
         David Blair
        </a>
        , who received an award for decades of officialdom and service on the judiciary panel of the IRL. I further congratulate Daniel Roos of the Fassifern club for his award as coach of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ipswich Rugby League continues to flourish despite the challenges. It is time for an NRL team in Ipswich. It is time for the Western Corridor. It is time the NRL listened. It is time for Ipswich.
