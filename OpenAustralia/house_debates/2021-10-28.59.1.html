       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to Liz Rogers, a beloved and treasured member of the Kempsey community, who passed away on Tuesday surrounded by a large, loving family. Liz leaves her devoted husband of more than 60 years, Bevan; seven children: Michelle, Tony, Mark, John, Cathy, Bob and Natalie and their respective partners; 16 grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liz was 85 years old. Just two weeks ago she competed in an 18-hole tournament at Frederickton Golf Club. Liz was still the ladies captain at Fredo and had been for many, many years. Prior to her round, she had lamented that she was feeling a little tired and disappointed she would need to use an electric cart for the very first time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liz was known to be tenacious and also a quiet achiever. She had a passion for and a lifelong commitment to hockey, playing as a schoolgirl in Taree and then dedicating more than 40 years as a player and coach in Kempsey. Liz had the pleasure of playing hockey with her daughters and played competitively until she was 70, when she was forced into retirement by a broken thumb. This, however, allowed more time for golf, which she addressed with the same passion and commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        We honour the passing of a wonderful wife, mother, matriarch, friend and dedicated community member and volunteer. Vale, Liz Rogers. You will be fondly remembered and dearly missed.
       </p>
