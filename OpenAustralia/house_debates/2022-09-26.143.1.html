       <p>
        Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. We have some of the best health professionals, the best health researchers and some of the best facilities. But all that counts for nothing if Australians can't access the healthcare system, and this begins with seeing a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        . If you can't see a GP, you can't have minor concerns resolved, you can't get a prescription and you can't get referred to a specialist. If you can't see a GP, the health system is basically Google and a pharmacy. Access to GPs is absolutely critical for the health and wellbeing of Australians. But for the residents of Wentworth access to a GP is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive.
       </p>
       <p>
        This affects everyone, but particularly lower-income residents. Those members of the community depend on bulk-billed services. They often cannot afford out-of-pocket costs, especially if they need regular consultations. So many residents raised these concerns that I asked my team to survey clinics in the community. The results were deeply concerning. Of the 49 GP clinics in Wentworth, just four offer exclusive bulk-billing services. Another 20 offer mixed bulk-billing and full-fee services, but five of those told us that bulk-billing was offered only at the doctor's discretion. A number of others have restricted eligibility, such as limiting access to children or pensioners. This really worries me. But I'm worried that this number is also shrinking rapidly. So far this year, at least seven clinics have shifted from being bulk-billed to mixed-fee practices. I know others are considering this. But most worrying is that some of the GPs who offer bulk-billed care at the moment are nearing retirement. When they go, there may not be another GP to replace them, certainly not one who bulk-bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those who have to go to full-fee clinics, the out-of-pocket costs can be significant. Half the clinics charge patients between $50 and $80 for a standard consultation. Many charge more. At least six clinics have already raised their fees this year. Many will follow. I have spoken to local GPs about this. They understand it makes it difficult to access care, but they say it's not viable to operate bulk-billed clinics anymore in Wentworth. What they receive from Medicare is not enough to cover their costs. At the same time, we are facing an acute shortage of GPs around the country and an acute shortage of GP training. This is fast becoming a crisis for Wentworth, as it is for communities all around the country. I have shared my concerns directly with the minister. I urge him and government to act on these concerns urgently and ensure that Medicare remains the effective, respected and accessible system it was intended to be, and that we are training and developing and retaining the GPs we need to meet community needs.
