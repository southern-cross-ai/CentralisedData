       <p>
        I rise to bring to the attention of the House the sad passing of Mr Graham Borgges, affectionately known as Mr B, who sadly passed away last night. Mr B was a true Oxley legend. He had been treasurer of the Oxley Otters Swimming Club since the 1980s and made an incredible contribution beside his late wife, Sadie, over many decades, helping and supporting kids in swimming. The Otters swim club summed it up earlier today, stating: 'It is with deepest sadness that we regret to inform our club members of the passing of Mr B last night. He was a pillar of our club and an icon of the Oxley community and will be greatly missed.'
       </p>
       <p>
        You can see just how much Mr B meant to the Otters swim club and how much he was loved in our community by looking at the comments on the club's Facebook page in just a few hours today. In 2010, the swimming club grandstand was named in his honour. When the club suffered under the 2011 floods, he was there day and night, even though his own street and suburb were inundated. He had also been a continuing member of the Oxley State School P&amp;C for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr B was very generous with his advice and time for me in my roles as a councillor and as a federal member of parliament. Mr B, you're a hero to our community. We value everything you did for our kids. I know my thoughts and the thoughts of many Oxley community members are with his family, his children and his grandchildren. Rest in peace, Mr B.
