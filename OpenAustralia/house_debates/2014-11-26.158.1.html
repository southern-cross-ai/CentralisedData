        Throughout the month of November, the Shop Small campaign is being held across Australia. This is an incredibly important movement that promotes the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who establish, own or work in the small business sector and it also recognises the positive role small businesses play in our communities. I am pleased to have joined my parliamentary colleagues in the launch in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and both sides of the House are working together to encourage people in their local communities to shop at their local small businesses, especially in this crucial period leading up to Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The small business sector is vitally important to the Australian economy; small business employs more than 5 million Australians and contributes around 47 per cent of private sector employment. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , I was pleased to read that 90 per cent of consumers visit a local small business at least once a week. This campaign is trying to encourage this to occur more regularly. If we do shop locally, then we are ensuring that our communities continue to thrive in turn creating jobs and stimulating the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not always easy to own and run a small business and we know there is a lot of effort put in by many people—hours of unpaid work—to ensure their business gets up and running and thrives. Therefore we should do everything we can to support our local businesses—whether it is the local grocer, baker or butcher and a range of other businesses in your local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I visited several small businesses in the seat of Kingston. First I caught up with Norm, who owns
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Morphett Vale
        </a>
        Fresh Bakery with his wife, Liz. Norm said one of the biggest challenges they face as a small business is competing with the larger supermarket chains. Norm proudly told me that he sells two loaves of fresh bread for $5. The price and quality are more than competitive with the supermarkets, but Norm said customers go into their bakery for their award winning pies but then go off to the supermarket to purchase bread without realising it is often cheaper to buy it at his bakery. Norm said one of the challenges he faces is changing consumers' attitudes and habits so that they do buy local—and that is what Shop Small month is all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        I then visited Model Mania in Morphett Vale—owned by Don and Merilyn for an impressive 29 years. They sell a range of different models. It is a very exciting shop which people should visit for gifts for loved ones at Christmas—there were planes, spaceships and a whole range of things to put together. In speaking to Don and Merilyn, they face different challenges to Norm and Liz, but, like so many small businesses, they are under increasing pressure from cheap, online overseas products. But Don and Merilyn have not given up; they value add in their service, knowledge and ability to meet their customers' needs. While they have to compete with online shopping they are finding ways to ensure their customers get what they want. I must say it is excellent service and, with 29 years' experience, it is certainly worth a visit around Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        These examples are just two of the 2500 small businesses in my electorate, providing locals with jobs and boosting the economy. A lot of small businesses not only employ people but also give back to the community. On the weekend it was the Christies Beach Christmas Pageant, where we saw many local businesses participate, giving back to the local community and bringing joy to many young people. In this Shop Small Month I would encourage people all around Australia in the lead up to Christmas to shop local and shop small. I know some members of parliament have demonstrated local fashion and I hope that people continue to support their local businesses.
