        This year, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Lawrence Hall
        </a>
        is turning 125, and there are big plans afoot for this weekend. The hall has a wonderful history of which the executive—president Peter Kelsall, vice-president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wright" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Wright
        </a>
        , treasurer Ellen Maloney and secretary Lorna Reeves—are very proud. I would also like to thank the trustees and the organising committee for this weekend's celebrations—Robert Reeves, Roz Jones, Nev and Patricia Taber, Kevin and Joyce Gordon, Daniel Spears, Roger and Dulcie Reeves and especially Jennifer Sumskis—for their tireless commitment to the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hall is a central point of any community. We have dances in our local hall. We have wedding celebrations in our local halls. We have christenings and indeed wakes. They literally witness all the major events in a community and people's lives, and, as people say, if walls could talk, what a story the walls of not just the Lawrence Hall but many halls could tell. They host many other events as well at the Lawrence Hall. They host fundraisers and events for kids. Most recently they have hosted Australia's Biggest Morning Tea, a movie night, lamington drives,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        events and stage plays. This weekend 3 June is going to be a big day. There is a vintage car display, a mobile library and a history presentation of the hall and the local area. The local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>
        will also be cooking a barbecue for the community. There will of course be a birthday cake. Festivities start at the hall at 11 am on Saturday, and I cannot wait to join in the celebrations.

        I had the pleasure last weekend of attending the award celebration of the

        Surf Life Saving Club. They are a small club but very committed. I would like to congratulate the award winners: the Club Person of the Year, Paul Ellem; the Junior Club Person of the Year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Mason" rel="nofollow">

        This club has also had many challenges. We have obviously had many shark sightings. Indeed I was there one day this year when there was a shark sighting. The surf lifesaving club called everyone off the beach and had many extra duties because of the extra pressures. I would also like to thank the executive—Ben Redman, David Sly, Jodie Irwin, Avan Christie, Michael Pontesract,
