        Members would be aware that, under the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, the Presiding Officers have the responsibility to appoint the

         Parliamentary Budget Officer
        </a>
        , subject to the approval of the proposed appointment by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit. Following the resignation late last year of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Ms Jenny Wilkinson, the President of the Senate and I commenced a competitive recruitment process to fill the position. I'm pleased to inform the House that following this process the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has approved the appointment of Dr Stein Helgeby as the new Parliamentary Budget Officer. His term will commence on 18 November. On behalf of members I congratulate him on his appointment, and the President and I look forward to working with him. I'm sure members will join me in wishing him every success in this new and very important role.

         The committee responsible for the oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office—the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Committee
         </a>
         of Public Accounts and Audit—is required by legislation to consider the appointment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Budget_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Parliamentary Budget Officer
         </a>
         as proposed by the Presiding Officers and to approve or reject this proposal. The committee is then required to report to both houses of the parliament on its decision. In accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, I am pleased to inform the parliament that the committee has approved the proposal that Dr Stein Helgeby be appointed as the Parliamentary Budget Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Officer is to support the parliament by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. Dr Helgeby has extensive experience in these areas and has held a range of positions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         , including as deputy secretary in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Finance
         </a>
         for the last 10 years. Dr Helgeby has also held senior executive roles in the Victorian Department of Treasury and Finance. As Deputy Secretary, Budget and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">
          Financial Management
         </a>
         , he was responsible for budget reporting and financial management frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee considers that Dr Helgeby's background, together with his public policy experience and familiarity with budget frameworks and fiscal policy issues, will enable him to ensure that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
          PBO
         </a>
         continues their important work whilst maintaining the independent and non-partisan nature of the office. The committee looks forward to working with Dr Helgeby on his commencement in the PBO.
