        ) on the motion of Mr McCormackâ€”That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that Australia faces a foot and mouth disease (

        </a>
        ) biosecurity crisis on its borders;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) to date, Indonesia has recorded hundreds of thousands of FMD cases during the uncontrolled outbreak of this disease;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) an outbreak of FMD in Australia would inflict catastrophic damage on Australia's $80 billion livestock industry, decimate the agriculture sector, significantly hurt the Australian economy, and increase the everyday cost of food;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) since FMD was detected in Bali on 5 July 2022, it took more than three weeks of indecision and delay for the Government to introduce disinfectant footbaths at international Australian airports; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Government has failed to respond quickly and decisively to this biosecurity threat, and has failed in its responsibility to introduce critical biosecurity protections to keep Australia safe from FMD; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately offer a 3D X-ray screening program with Indonesia, so that organic and plant matter in luggage can be effectively identified;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) immediately enforce a ban on all passengers from Indonesia bringing any food products into Australia; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) immediately confirm the current biosecurity risk level and at what point, predicated on scientific data, the international border with Indonesia would need to be temporarily closed, in order to protect Australia from the threat of FMD.

       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Fair Work Commission has delivered a 5.2 per cent rise in the minimum wage, slightly above headline inflation;

        (c) many low-paid workers are young, female, in casual employment, and are far more likely to find themselves experiencing financial hardship, and many of them are on the frontline delivering essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government put forward its own submission to the Fair Work Commission advocating for an immediate wage increase for Australia's low-paid workers;

        (b) for nearly a decade, low wages were a deliberate design feature of the former Government; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) high and rising inflation, and weak wages growth are reducing real wages across the economy and creating cost-of-living pressures for Australia's low-paid workers; and

        (3) congratulates the:

       <p class="italic">
