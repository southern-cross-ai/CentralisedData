       <p>
        There was a moment in the Moreton-Rankin Unity cricket game a couple of Sundays ago where I thought I was facing a young

        , but instead I was actually facing the member for Moreton who put in one of the greatest spells of bowling I have ever seen in my life. As much as I wish it was otherwise, his was one of the best overs. I want to congratulate him and his Moreton team for evening the series at 1-all after Rankin's one-run victory in the inaugural game last year. This year their huge 110-run target off 18 overs was far too much for my boys to chase down. Most of those runs were probably scored off my one over. The game pits Muslim players from Rankin mosques against players from Moreton mosques and it is all about building understanding and a spirit of unity. On a serious note, it was the day after the Paris attacks, and so we began with a minute's silence for the victims.

        I am so proud of the way the game was played, and the spirit and dedication shown by every single person involved. I thank the member for Moreton and his co-captain, Ali Kadri. I thank my co-captain, Ahsan Asadi; all the players; the umpires, who donated their time; St Laurie's, for letting us use the field at Runcorn; and all the volunteers and staff who made it workâ€”who cooked the barbecue and did all the legwork to make it such a terrific day. It is fast becoming the key contest of the Australian summer! I really look forward to lifting the shield next year.
