        Highfields is finally on the way to having a new library, thanks to the Morrison government. After years of planning and deliberation by the

        , I was honoured to turn the first sod on this vibrant community project last week. I am very proud that the government was able to support this project through the Local Road and Community Infrastructure Program, contributing $5 million out of a $7.5 million total project cost. It's exciting to see a new vision for Highfields taking shape. As a unique local identity it's only growing stronger as more people move to the area. It is growing. Highfields is now comparable in size to the town of Warwickâ€”not bad for an outer suburb. Young families, particularly, are making the move to the leafy area for its affordable housing and community amenities, like the wonderful news Highfields Sport and

        . The new library will only add to this, providing a central meeting place for the community to come together and access crucial services. It will include a customer service centre, community meeting rooms, a dedicated junior meeting area, computer facilities and photocopying services. It was great to see the Toowoomba based company McNab Developments awarded the tender for the design and construction. As our economy recovers from COVID-19 it's important we keep as much of this kind of work as we can local, supporting local jobs and suppliers. I look forward to seeing the finished product early next year. I would particularly like to thank for their hard work Mayor Paul Antonio, Councillor Tim McMahon and previous councillors,

        and Joe Ramia, who did so much in bringing this project to fruition.
