       <p>
        I wish to share with the House my recent visit to an outstanding school in my electorate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_View_Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Valley View Public School
        </a>
        in Wyoming. I would like to thank the relief principal, Mr Dave Stitt, for his invitation, and to congratulate Dave and his staff on the outstanding work that they are doing at the school. The school motto is 'innovation, opportunity and success', and this is a school which practises what it preaches. I addressed the school assembly and presented flags and certificates of appreciation to students who had participated in the community writing project. Mr Stitt proudly took me to visit the new Hardware Playzone that is a joint effort by the school, parents and carers of the multi-categorical class, Central Coast Bunnings Hardware stores, and other local small businesses who supplied labour and materials. This innovative playground is now providing a happy and safe area for children with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASD" rel="nofollow">
         ASD
        </a>
        , and is shared between the multi-categorical class, the mainstream body and the Glenville Satellite class. It is proof of what can be achieved when the community works together. I especially wish to acknowledge the efforts of Miss Taimi Saxon from the multi-categorical class for her dedication to this projectâ€”and whose drive and enthusiasm made it all possible. It was great to join everyone who assisted in the building of the Hardware Playzone at the thank-you morning tea. My visit to the school was completed with a tour where I was able to observe the innovative learning techniques and aids that the school has adopted for their students as part of their curriculum. I look forward to a return visit in the near future.
