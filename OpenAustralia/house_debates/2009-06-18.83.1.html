       <p>
        I rise to table a petition from 486 of my constituents regarding the importation and sale of trail bikes and monkey bikes. This petition was generated by a problem that exists in my electorate from individuals and groups of individuals riding trail bikes and very small bikes which are referred to as monkey bikes. These are miniature bikes that look a bit like a miniature road bike or a miniature Harley-Davidson and are powered by 50cc motors. There is a plague of them in the northern suburbs of my electorate, in the township of Gawler and in particular along the coastal beaches such as Middle Beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bikes seem quite comical and I think people ride them in the belief that it is an innocent recreational activity. In fact, it is an incredibly dangerous activity both for the rider and for pedestrians and others who use these places. The riding of these bikes has been linked to antisocial behaviour such as drinking and assaults in public parks and it has greatly affected the amenity of many areas in my electorate. One of these places I have been out to is the Gawler River Junction, where the North Para and South Para rivers meet. I was out there the other day with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        announcing $3 million to build a number of bridges and walkways in this area. While waiting for the minister with the mayor and other local residents a couple of these very small motorbikes howled through the existing walkways. They can be particularly dangerous for residents who are walking their dogs or playing with their children or walking on the beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already we have had two residents killed while riding these bikes. One was in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_North" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The individual was, sadly, intoxicated and rode one of these small motorbikes up the train line, fell off and died of head injuries. Another fellow died in Munno Para car park from injuries sustained while riding one of these bikes. This has happened because these bikes do not meet Australian design standards. They are imported from China, and there is no design standard that they have to meet, and they are not road registrable. People can buy them from anybody who wishes to import them. They are quite dangerous because they do not meet design standards and even at very low speeds cannot turn properly. Problems arise when people are belting along at up to 50 kilometres an hour and have to dodge some person or inanimate object and then find themselves going over the handlebars. One young man I know through a friend is 21 and doing his teaching degree. He is a fine and upstanding citizen in nearly every way, but one night he made the mistake of getting on one of these bikes and ended up in Flinders Hospital emergency ward. He had to wait for eight hours to see a doctor. Unfortunately, he is now going to carry an injury for life because he shattered his ankle to such an extent they expect to have to fuse it.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can ban these bikes. I think the state government has to crack down on the illegal use of these bikes. Frankston

        has resolved the problem through strong fines and enforcement of their strong laws. I think state, federal and local governments can act to prevent this problem. One tends to think it is an innocent problem but in fact it is very serious and has been reported as such in the Adelaide

       <p class="italic">
        This illegal activity is a danger to the riders of such vehicles and to the public. It causes environmental degradation and damage to parks and property, and infringes on local amenity.

        This activity has resulted in the deaths of two riders in the northern suburbs of Adelaide.

        We therefore ask that the Federal Parliament consider laws to ban the sale and import of monkey bikes.
