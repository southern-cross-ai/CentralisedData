        The coronavirus has created some tough times for Australians, both at home and overseas. I want to update the House on the amazing work that volunteers are doing in looking after their fellow Australians. In order to stop coronavirus in Australia, the Morrison government implemented a 14-day self-isolation period. Despite the inconvenience it may have caused, most of those coming back from overseas stayed in self-isolation as it was the right thing to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wonderful thing is that, in tough times, Australians stick together. A number of community based volunteer groups have emerged to help those in need. I want to commend their work today. The Melbourne Grocery Delivery Squad volunteer group was set up in the last 12 days to assist members of our community with shopping for groceries and everyday essential items. The Melbourne Grocery Delivery Squad has more than 170 volunteers, covering 60 suburbs in Victoria. Many of them are in my electorate of Chisholm. People in quarantine can make a list of items they need and send it to an area coordinator, who will then organise shoppers to deliver goods right to the person's door. These people and the volunteers will not meet each other face to face. After leaving the groceries at the door, the volunteers will send a message or simply wave at the people in the house. This is an incredible effort of selflessness for someone you may never see again. The work of these volunteers may seem minor at face value, as they are only doing someone's shopping. However, as small as the gesture may be, the impact for those who are in stressful situations, worrying about the welfare of their families overseas, as well as their families here in Australia, is truly great. Thank you, Jason Yang, Elsa Du and the whole delivery squad. You have helped more than 1,000 families.
       </p>

        The 14-day self-isolation period is a necessary step that ensures the coronavirus does not spread here in Australia. This government has made sure that we are all safe to go about our daily activities. With this in mind, I ask my constituents in Chisholm to join me shopping at the Glen or going to
