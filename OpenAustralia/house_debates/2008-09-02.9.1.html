         I can inform the parliament that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         of Australia has just announced that it will cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent. This, the first interest rate cut in seven years, will take the official cash rate down to seven per cent and will provide some modest relief to mortgage holders right across Australia. The government knows that there is still much, much more to be done in helping Australian families dealing with cost-of-living pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the average mortgage, today’s interest rate cut will put nearly $600 each year back into the family budget. I am advised that for 740,000 first-time buyers this will be the first time they have ever experienced an interest rate cut. The government expect the banks to pass on this rate cut because, given the high levels of profitability for Australia’s commercial banks, we believe that they have a responsibility to do so. If you pass on interest rate hikes, you have a responsibility also to pass on interest rate cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
         This interest rate decision is welcome, but it is not a day for celebration.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rates" rel="nofollow">
          Interest rates
         </a>
         took a long time to rise, and they will take a long time to come back down—and the road will be a very uneven one on the way through. That is why the government is committed to continuing a policy of responsible economic management designed to make it as easy as possible for the Reserve Bank in the future to reduce interest rates further.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would add one final point. There will be more tough times ahead as we continue to battle the economic turbulence abroad and high inflation and interest rates at home. That is why the government is absolutely committed and determined to prosecute its program of responsible economic management into the future—a program of long-term economic reform based on an education revolution, based on our reforms to infrastructure and based on our program of business deregulation—because the government is determined to steer the Australian economy through the difficult times which lie ahead.

            <p>
             To return to points raised by those opposite earlier today, there is this assumption that you cannot prosecute a strategy dealing with the long-term challenges of inflation at the same time as prosecuting a strategy which deals with the long-term challenges of employment. Those opposite seem to think that you can have one or the other. We believe we can prosecute a strategy for the long term which deals with the inflation challenges for the economy as well as the challenges for employment, education, skills and training. And that is very much at the heart of the government’s economic strategy.

            <p>
             I am surprised, however, given the Leader of the Opposition’s intervention in this debate today on interest rates, that we have a further evolution of the Nelson doctrine from yesterday.

               he will do exactly the opposite in government. That is the articulated Nelson doctrine from yesterday. What he says in opposition he will now guarantee to do exactly the reverse of if in government. That is what he said yesterday. And the exchange yesterday, that memorable exchange on the doors, about his attitude to the

                Reserve Bank

               and providing them with instructions to cut official interest rates by 50 basis points, and his then turning round and saying, ‘Of course, if I were Prime Minister, I would not say that at all’—that is remarkable. There is one question I would pose to the Leader of the Opposition, and it is this: when does this Nelson doctrine end? If the Nelson doctrine is one which says, ‘What I say today on interest rates as Leader of the Opposition does not’—

                  In my answer to the question earlier on about inflation and employment, I responded with what the government’s strategy was in respect of both those propositions. On the question of the relationship between inflation and interest rates, that is what I am going to. We have spoken already about the government’s strategy for creating an environment to bring down inflationary pressures so that the

                                    to take this decision today is certainly very welcome—although it does not seem to be supported by those on the other side.

                                    Today’s cut by the Reserve Bank will put nearly $600 a year back into the hands of a family with an average mortgage. Families have waited a long time for this relief. This is the first interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank in seven years. Some 740,000 families have never known a decision by the Reserve Bank to cut rates. It has taken seven years. And, of course, we know why that is the case: because Australian families had to endure 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite, and that added something like $400 a month to the mortgage bill of an average person with a mortgage—$400 a month. That was certainly the legacy of the member for Higgins—one that those over there are continually in denial over.

                                    will pass it on effective from 8 September. That is certainly going to be welcomed by many people out there. It will be welcome relief, but there is still so much more to do to take pressure off inflation and interest rates. I will quote from the first paragraph of the Reserve Bank’s statement today:
                                   </p>
                                   <p class="italic">
                                    Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    What is that talking about? It is talking about the 20 warnings that those opposite received from the Reserve Bank over a three-year period. It is talking about the need for nation building to solve capacity constraints in the economy. Of course, then there was the reckless spending by those opposite that the member for Higgins admitted to in the Howard biography. What we are going to do is put in place a responsible economic policy which deals with investment in the future through nation building and which puts in place a disciplined fiscal policy. I think you can tell that those opposite today do not really understand how tough families out there are doing it. For the Leader of the Opposition this is just some form of political opportunism. We have seen that in question time today. He wants to score a political point about this instead of welcoming this move. This is very welcome news for Australian families, very welcome news for the Australian economy, and it is good news that should be celebrated by all in this House.

                                      I was talking before about the political opportunism and the stupidity of those opposite, and it is just so evident in that question. Why is the economy slowing? It is slowing under the weight of 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite—something they want to forget about. They do not want to admit to 10 interest rate rises in a row and the impact that is having on the growth prospects of this economy.

                                      this morning and he pretended that there was no such thing as 10 interest rate rises in a row and that they could not have had any impact on domestic growth. Then he wanted to ignore the impact of global economic conditions. He was pretending that the global oil price spike had not happened. No, there was no impact on inflation from that. He was pretending that global financial market turbulence is not pushing up borrowing rates for households and business. He was pretending that it has not had any impact on stock markets. It has had a big impact, and this government is dealing with it responsibly through a responsible fiscal policy—stopping their reckless spending and building a surplus, which they are now attacking in the Senate; putting in place the essential investment for nation building to solve those capacity constraints that have put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Of course, all they are worried about over there is their own individual leadership prospects. Plan A over there, the Leader of the Opposition, is just worried about what it will mean for his leadership.

                                         It was a question about interest rates, it was a question about sustainable employment growth, it was a question about prosperity, and what stuns me in this House today is that we get such juvenile questions from the opposition.
